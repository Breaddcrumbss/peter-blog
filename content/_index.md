## FOREWORD

This blog comprises literary works composed by me over the year, starting at around 1984. Most were self-published in ten books, printed by Conet Printing. As these were circulated to only few friends, it seemed appropriate to place them on a blog. The blog does not include the two books published by me commercially with World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd: *Down Memory Lane* and *Maybe a Swan Song*.

My self-published works were, of course, arranged chronologically. The blog is arranged differently: it is  divided into six parts. The first sets out my personal details. The remaining five arrange my publications in a topical sequence: Novels, Novellas, Legal Episode, Short Stories and Essays.

The blog does not cover books and articles dealing with legal problems. A list thereof is set out  in the first part.
