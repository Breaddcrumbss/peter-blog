### 1. Archie’s Analysis of Evolution

Archie and I were teletransported back to our ward on a slow moving beacon. On our way, Archie looked at me thoughtfully.

“Peter’le, why did Darwin and you keep addressing each other by surnames? Why didn’t he call you Peter or Peter’le?”

“Society was formal in his era. Using a proper name when addressing a person would imply superiority or familiarity. Darwin and I addressed one another as equals. I fell in line with the etiquette of his day.”

“I see,” nodded Archie. “But tell me do you really think that the individual’s role was as limited as you suggested earlier on?”

“I fear that this may be so. I am inclined to think that each of the seven punchees was a product of his time.”

“How about Genghis Khan?”

“I suspect that if he had not united the Mongols someone else would have done so.”

“But would he have built an empire?”

“I suspect that once a Mongol leader realised the potential of the military force he commanded, he was bound to act and conquer.”

“How about Darwin, whom you admire?”

“He came at the right time. I suspect that any reader of Malthus’ book had the potential of adapting his theory to the world of nature.”

“Basically, Peter’le, you believe that humanity went through its own process of evolution?”

“It wasn’t a strait line. Humanity had its ups and downs. Its evolution is a zigzag. Still, all in all, humanity experienced a progression. Darwin covered the point in The Descent.”

“It would appear that there has been no branching,” grunted Archie

“Homo Sapiens is the only remaining Homo species. There were some before us (or possibly even during our own years on earth) but now they have become extinct.”

“I know,” agreed Archie. “I have read about them. Do you think that some new species may come into existence?”

“Difficult to say. Homo Sapiens has been around for a relatively short time. Even so, some authors talk about a Superman. And remember, Archie, changing circumstances or major catastrophes can take place at any time. Who knows what sort of turn evolution might take in its wake.”

“Darwin’s theory leaves room for it,” opined Archie.

“it does; but, remember, the future is not ours to see.”





### 2. A Win-win Situation



Tiger and Moti welcomed us as soon as we surfaced. At Tiger’s suggestion I went for a swim. Archie rested comfortably in his small hut on Moti’s back. The chat with Darwin had been most interesting. All the same, both Archie and I were fatigued. We needed a rest.



Later in the day, the four of us had an informal meeting. Our object was to determine the course to be taken in the forthcoming meeting with the panel.

“Peter’le, what would happen if the panel approved your choices?”

“I have no idea. I suppose they may move me to paradise.”

“But what is wrong in this ward? Aren’t you enjoying yourself here?” asked Archie. “You have become one of us.”

“Actually, I should hate being moved somewhere else,” I confirmed.

“In that case isn’t it better if they disapprove? Surely, they would then ask you to punch some other noses,” observed Tiger.

“And in that case they will allow Lord Pan to make arrangements for your accommodation. I feel confident that he will send you back to us,” concluded Archie.

“In other words, it is a win-win situation,” averred Tiger. “Regardless of the outcome we look forward to your coming back.”

Moti, who had kept silent throughout, trumpeted. It was an appropriate display of support.

Feeling deeply moved I smiled at the trio. It also dawned on me that, in reality, the hearing by the panel was bound to be anticlimactic. Still, I looked forward to it.
