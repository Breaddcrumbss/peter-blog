Sandwiched between the three cycle debates and Job’s final and seminal monologue (caps. 29–31, discussed subsequently) is the enigmatic chapter 28. It is neatly divided into two parts: (i) verses 1-11 and (ii) verses 12 to 28.

The first part commences with the word ki (כי). Greenstein[^60] rightly points out  that a poetic work does not commence with this word, which – literally translated – means ‘for’.

Regrettably, though the ensuing words do not constitute a meaningful succession to chapter 27. Indeed, it is difficult to fit them into the contents and the matrix of Job. The book deals with the theodicy issue. The first part of chapter 28 deals with the origin of metals and then proclaims the reign of cause and effect in our planet. It does not add any new nuance about the greatness and the invincibility of God.

The second part of chapter 28 is a eulogy of wisdom. The concluding words advise that “the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom: and to depart from evil is understanding” [28:28].

Just as the first part of the chapter, this eulogy of wisdom does not constitute part of the theological discourse of Job. In the words of Terrien: “There can be little doubt that this magnificent poem [cap. 28:12-28] on the accessibility of wisdom does not belong to the discourse of Job. It is not written in his style; it is not connected with the Joban context.”[^61]

Greenstein argues[^62] that the chapter constitutes part of Elihu’s discourse (discussed subsequently). Notwithstanding its elegance and authority, this specific analysis is subject to argument. Elihu’s thesis, to the effect that God is just, is not supported by chapter 28.

This leads to the conclusion that chapter 28, as a whole, does not form an integral part of Job. It has been included per incuriam. The error, though, is of considerable antiquity. Parts of chapter 28 are preserved in the Qumran Scroll.[^63]

Two points support the conclusion that chapter 28 is not part of Job. First, the MT versions of Job and Proverbs (that have come down to us) are contemporaneous.[^64] They are an integral part of the Wisdom Literature of the Old Testament and, in the MT, Job  is placed immediately after Proverbs.[^65] The feasibility of errors made in the copying process of biblical books is well known.[^66] There can be no doubt that the second part of chapter 28, that is, the hymn to wisdom, can be neatly read together with Proverbs. It is in harmony with the sentiments expressed in chapter 8 thereof.[^67]

Admittedly, the first part of chapter 28 does not mash neatly with Proverbs; but it might have been meant as a lead up to the notion that wisdom is akin to worship.  The reason the compiler placed the hymn of wisdom in  Job  is  because  Proverbs deals with points made in it succinctly; a lengthy discourse appeared more in line with Job than with Proverbs.  There are, of course, lengthy passages in Proverbs like the praise of a ‘worthy [diligent] wife’ [Prov. 31:10-31]. A lengthy eulogy of wisdom does not militate against that book’s structure.

The second point which highlights the alien nature of chapter 28 in the context of Job is in that it breaks the continuity of the main discourse. Chapter 29, which is the first part of Job’s closing monologue, follows naturally after the conclusion of the debates in chapter 27. Chapter 28 simply derogates from the lucidity of the Jobian discourse. The inescapable conclusion is that it does not form part of Job and, in all probability, was inserted in it after the promulgation of an original version which has not come down to us.
