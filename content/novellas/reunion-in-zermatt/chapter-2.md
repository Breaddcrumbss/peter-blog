### 1. Josephus and the Great Jewish Revolt

I  doubt if Pilkin and I would have become mates   had  it not been for the Josephus Flavius trial staged by TA.1 in 1950. Although the War of Independence was by then long over,  Israel had not fully recovered from its economic and social effects. Commodities were scarce, prices were high  and the black market was booming. One of the objectives of Israeli schools of that period  was to turn its pupils into good citizens. Nobody was held in  greater contempt than a traitor to the struggle for the survival of the two years old nation.

A  pedagogical  tool used in this effort was the holding  of  historical trials of all those who had been untrue to the cause of the Jewish struggle for survival. Benedictus Spinoza, sad to tell, was one of the many victims. The prime target, though, was Josephus Flavius, held universally in contempt for his alleged betrayal of  the Jewish struggle against the yoke of the Roman empire in the first century A.D.



Josephus  Flavius – Joseph ben Matityahu in Hebrew – was the heir of  a cosmopolitan  and hence assimilated family of priests. Little is known about his early years  except that  he  obtained a liberal education. In his mid-twenties, he  travelled  to Rome to plead the cause of some zealots who had been sent for trial by  Felix, the then procurator of Judea. Josephus secured an introduction to Nero Caesar’s wife, the promiscuous Popea, and persuaded her, by means of a bribe, to secure the dismissal of the charges.

Josephus then spent a number  of  happy  years  in the metropolis of the world.  On  his  return  to Jerusalem,  he discovered  that the small protectorate was getting ready  to  raise the  banner of revolt. He was sent to the Galilee by the conservative  members of  the  Grand  Sanhedrin,  with instructions to nip the  movement  in  the  bud.

Josephus relates in his autobiography how he attempted to carry out his mission but  was overtaken by the tide. In the event, he found himself at the head  of the liberation movement in the hilly north. He was given the task of fortifying and defending the township of Jodefet (Jotapata in Latin), an important centre of the rebels.

Was  Josephus  blinded  by the enthusiasm of the  hour?  Did  his  inner traditional  though suppressed Jewish self get the better of  his sophisticated and elegant  veneer? Views differ. His conversion, though, did little to save  the cause: the outcome was clear from the outset. True to tradition, a Roman  army marched  down  from Antioch  and, grinding slowly but steadily,  quenched  the rebellion mercilessly.  The  crucial chapter in the Galilee took place when the  walls  of Jodefet, manned by Josephus’ corps, came tumbling down. Scourging and crucifixion were amongst the punishments meted out to the freedom fighters caught alive.

Those  who  managed to escape joined comrades  defending  lesser  towns. Josephus  and  some of his men were trapped in a cave. When  tribunes  of  the Roman  army  offered  them their lives, Josephus was  tempted.  His  comrades refused.  After  a  vehement argument, the  group  agreed  to  commit communal  suicide,  drawing  lots to determine the order  of  the  executions. Josephus was one of the last caught. Reverting to his original  design, he  persuaded  the other survivor to surrender together with  him. 

Initially,  Josephus  was put in chains and was to be sent to  Rome  for punishment. Never at a loss, he insisted such a plan was wasteful  because the Roman  commander,  Flavius Vaspasian, was soon to succeed to the  throne  upon Nero’s death. Sceptical yet gratified, Vaspasian relented. When the prediction came true, he granted the fugitive a pardon and, eventually, adopted him  into his own family.

After  the fall Jerusalem, which was razed to the ground by  Vaspasian’s son, Titus, Josephus proceeded to Rome. During the long reign of the Flavians, he composed two major historical works: ‘The Wars of the Jews and the  Romans’ and  ‘Antiquities  of the Jews’. In defence  of  his defection,   he pleaded a dream in which a divine voice prompted him  to record the  history of the Jewish revolt.

It has to be conceded that his book on  the subject remains the main source of that sad chapter in human sufferings. But this achievement did little to cleanse his tarnished image. European and Jewish historians alike have dubbed him  a coward and  traitor. Many of them overlooked the basic fact that historical treatises – except Josephus’ tomes – were laconic on the subject.


### 2. An Informal Planning Session over Pita Falafel


TA.1’s   historical  trial  of  Josephus  was  meant  to  follow what had, by then, become a   well established   precedent amongst Israeli secondary schools.  Three  pupils  renowned  for  their  orthodoxy   and nationalism,  including fair Shosh who had written an epic essay on the heroism  of the  Great Revolt, were constituted judges. Pilkin, who was considered a  fine  orator and  a sound performer, was to lead the prosecution. Difficulties  arose  when the Principal sought to nominate an attorney for the defence: nobody wanted to plead  the cause of a Quisling. After some wranglings, I agreed to  assume  the role. Having studied Josephus’ extant writings, I concluded he had been misunderstood.

A  few weeks before the trial, Pilkin and I held an informal  conference on a bench in Rothschild Boulevard over a Pita Falafel. Initially, Pilkin was too  engrossed  in  his  repast  to  concentrate  on  more  mundane   matters. Eventually,  he  smacked his lips, smiled with satisfaction and  came  to  the point.

“Look here, Bushi,  we don’t want to spend too much time on this trial? Last term I  bombed   out  in the algebra test  and  your  performance  in chemistry  ...”

“  ... the less said the better,” I muttered in disgust. “For  the life of me, I can’t see  why they force  ‘humanists’ to take at least one science subject! What use is a science subject going to be to one of us?”

“Ours not to question!” Pilkin replied but  nodded sympathetically. “I suppose these topics are meant to broaden our horizons; give us a balance!”

“I have enough trouble with Arabic without all this nonsense about chemistry. If you hadn’t  lent  me your notes when I was sick last month, I would’ve  bombed  the test in Arabic too!”

“You  lose  a  lot of time when you get these bouts of Asthma.  All  the  more reason to economise on the time spent on this trial. So why not agree to ... streamline?”

“We can try. What are your main accusations against Josephus?”

“We’ll ‘indict’ him for poor military leadership, cowardice, assimilation, unreliability as historian  and, of course, treason.”

“My  main concern is the last. The others involve a value judgment;  and  they are minor when compared with treason. For instance, Herodotus was not only the father of history but also the father of lies. And I don’t find our modern historians reliable. And why not drop this ‘assimilated’ Jew business. Most educated Jews of that period were assimilated.”

“A question of degree!” Pilkin tried to sound firm.

“True.  But we know little about Josephus’ ‘status’ and affiliations prior  to the Great Revolt. So if  you leave that bit out, you can reduce your team by one witness. It’ll save  a lot  of time on preparation.”

“All right then,” Pilkin nodded. “So I’ll call only four witnesses. And you?”

“I won’t call witnesses. I’ll make my points by cross-examining yours.”

### 3. Issues of Procedure

Pilkin’s eyes popped wide open. For a few moments he gazed at me in disbelief. Based on his experiences in TA.1 and in debating clubs, he had formed the belief that all controversial issues had to be resolved by logical arguments based on written texts. He had no appreciation of the procedural devices  used in courts and by committees of enquiry.

“Is the method you have in mind  OK?” he asked at long last.

“Done all the times in real courts!”

“Shosh tells me you watch  trials from time to time! So do you want to become a lawyer?” Pilkin let his disapproval show.

“Maybe.  You see, I dropped into our District Court last year, when we had a break between these two silly maths and physics exams in Jaffa Street. The cases I heard were exciting!”

“Rape  trials?”  Like  all adolescents, Pilkin was  interested  in  everything smacking of sex.

“No! One was a running down case and the other an industrial accident. In both cases the  defendants called no witnesses. Their lawyers broke the chaps  who  sued: the ‘plaintiffs’ in legal jargon, by subjecting them to awkward questions!”

“Not very nice!”

“Perhaps. But it was very efficient!”

“But in our trial, shouldn’t we stick to the Talmudic procedure?”

“But,  honestly,  Pilkin,” I protested, “what do we really know  about  Talmudic procedure except a lot of clichés!”

“True,” agreed Pilkin sadly. “But, Bushi, I know nothing about modern courtroom procedure!”

“Can’t say I know much. Still, we can watch a few trials together and get  the basics. For the rest we can improvise.”

“But court trials must be boring! I’ve no wish to become a lawyer or liar!”

“But you want to become an actor!”

“Precisely!”

“Some  lawyers  are  real showmen, Pilkin. One moment  they  are  purring kittens only to turn into roaring lions when it suits them!”

“Sounds interesting,” Pilkin reflected. “OK – let’s do it!”
