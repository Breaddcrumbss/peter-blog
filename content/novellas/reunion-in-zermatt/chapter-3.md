### 1. We Attend Trials

Our  teacher  granted  us leave to attend court  hearings during  three  mornings dominated  by  classes  on  science. As Pilkin’s home was  not  far  from  the District  Court  building,  I went to pick him up early in  the  morning.  His mother’s  unadorned  poorly furnished flat on the top floor of a  run  down apartment  block made me gape. Obviously, his late father had not  left  them well  off. Embarrassed, I remembered Shosh had told me that, when  opportunity presented  itself, Pilkin and his young brother, David, carried out odd  jobs, such  as  deliveries, doubling up for newspaper vendors  and  occasional  home repairs. To my relief, Pilkin appeared unaware of my consternation. He watched with satisfaction  as I sipped the cup of hot and aromatic lemon tea his mother brought  me  and then  showed  me, with relish, his small but neatly organised  and  catalogued collection of coins.

At  Pilkin’s  suggestion, we spent our first morning  watching  a  murder trial  and an armed robbery. Both cases were dull. In  neither  did the  accused have an alibi or coherent defence. We then watched a number of run of  the mill   road  and  industrial accident cases. Pilkin was taken  aback   by  the rigour and speed of the cross-examinations administered to the main  witnesses and  by  the  brevity of the lawyers’ arguments. And he was disappointed by the absence of drama.

To stem the flow of his critical comments, I took him to watch the final stage  of one of the spectacular trials of the day. It involved an action  for compensation for personal injuries suffered by a civil servant. He had bought a bottle  of  locally  distilled   brandy supposedly  fortified with pure alcohol. He had consumed the same fiery  drink on  previous  occasions without ill effects.  But this time the brandy was  laced  with  methylated spirits.  The  source was a hardware and paints shop. Its owner had sold  the  methylated  spirits to a painting contractor,  who,  together  with another  middleman, had eliminated the dye and smelly substance from the  liquid. The  rogues then sold it to the unsuspecting liqueur outlet at the  prevailing black market price for illegally imported pure alcohol. The civil servant was one of the unfortunate purchasers of the final product.

Pilkin  and I watched with fascination the pungent cross-examination  of the owner of the hardware and paints shop. Doggedly, Jacob Keren – a lawyer whose sparkling performance I had admired on previous occasions –  forced the witness to concede he had failed  to exercise proper care and prudence when he sold large quantities  of the ‘poison’ to a contractor who could not possibly need more than ‘one single bottle  at a time’ for his business as painter and renovator. Eventually,  the hapless  witness  even  admitted  that he knew the  ‘filthy  stuff’  could  be ‘doctored’.

“Yes - I understand,” said Keren, who despite his short and lean figure  loomed larger  than life.  “It was no villainy – just a lapse. Well, let me tell  you again what were the consequence: the plaintiff is now nearly blind,  partially deaf,  has a stammer and will walk unsteadily for the rest  of his life. Not a life to be envied!”

“This is not a proper question,” intervened the judge.

“I’ll  withdraw  it then, Your Honour. No further questions.”  Keren  nodded and sat down.

### 2. Meeting Jacob Keren

“What  an  act,”  said Pilkin when we made ourselves comfortable  at  a  nearby oriental restaurant, patronised by the legal fraternity of Tel Aviv.

“I agree. But, you know,  from what I have seen up to now, it’s clear  the screenplay has to follow some pretty tight rules,” I observed. “Even a showman like Keren must reckon with them when he improvises.”

“Can the other party’s lawyer step in?”

“Only  if the cross-examiner steps out of line, for instance, if  he  misleads the  witness or uses unfair tactics to bully or confuse him. Still,  when  the cross-examination is over, the other party’s lawyer can try to repair any damage.”

“With the few questions he asks when the cross-examination is finished?”

“Yes. They call it the ‘re-examination’. But a skilful cross-examiner like Keren guards his rear. He makes  sure that what he gets out of a witness will stick: just the way he did today.”

“I  see,” nodded Pilkin. “And is this how you want us to conduct our  trial  of Josephus? By examining, cross-examining and re-examining witnesses?”

“Well, yes: it’s more fun than just arguing!”

“I want to think this over,” said Pilkin. “Still, it appears alright. It’ll  put a bit of life into the case. But look here, Bushi ...”.




“Didn’t  I see you two in Court today?”  Jacob Keren’s protruding eyes were peering at us with unconcealed interest.

“We were there, Mr Keren,” I confirmed, rising  to my feet. Pilkin, in contrast, remained seated.

“And what drove you to our little show?” Keren wanted to know. “And haven’t  I seen you before, Mr. ...”.

“Eli  Berger,  Mr Keren,” I introduced myself, “and this is my  friend,  Chayim Rosenberg. And, yes, I come to watch court cases whenever I can.”

“You like the excitement?”

“I do indeed!”

“And you, Mr. Rosenberg?”

“Please, call me Chayim,” Pilkin replied. “I came because we are  going to  have  a trial at school. So Eli insisted I see what happens  in  the  real courts.”

“What sort of trial?” Keren was interested.

“A  historical trial of Josephus Flavius. Eli is the defence lawyer; I am  the prosecutor.”

“But how do you propose to go about it?” Keren asked with a smile. “The accused can’t give any evidence!”

“We’ll be using his writings, Mr. Keren,” I explained. “Do you know them?”

“I  do,  although  it’s been some time since I’ve read them. But  how  do  you propose to defend him? Who will be your witnesses?”

“I  don’t  intend  to  call any. I’ll make my points  by  cross-examining  my ‘Learned Colleagues’ witnesses. They’ll testify about Josephus’ writings.”

“So they’ll try to pierce holes and you’ll try to plug them?”

“My object is to establish his innocence!”

“But you needn’t prove him innocent. The prosecution must prove his guilt!”

“I know.  But  my poor client,” I said, startled as  both  Keren  and Pilkin grinned when I brandished the courtroom phrase, “has been maligned  for generations. To clear his name, I must show the accusations are unfounded!”

“And you’ll risk a ‘guilty’ verdict if your attempt fails?”

“He’ll be no worse off than before,” I observed.

“I see,” nodded Keren. “And what will be your strategy? But perhaps you don’t want to reveal your hand at this stage?”

Initially, I sought to dodge his question. The plan I had formed involved surprises. Communicating  an inkling of it to Pilkin might take the wind out of my sails. At the same time, I had no wish to appear evasive. After a short pause, I replied: “I intend to show that passages in Josephus’ books,  traditionally  used to prove his guilt, proclaim his innocence. I may fail – but not for want of trying!”

“A  daring plan; and quite imaginative,” Keren smiled supportively. “And  shall we  see you again in Court when your trial is over? You have been dropping  in for months.”

“And  I’ll continue to do so. You see, I’ve decided to study law. I come over in order to learn and gain experience.”

“But don’t you find many of the cases boring – plain routine?”

“I  do. But ever so often there is a fascinating case, like your  trial of today!”

“But much of what we do, especially office work, is mundane. Still, you’ll know  whether or not you have a penchant for it after your second year in law school. If you remain interested, come and see me!”

“Thanks,” I said, moved. “I’m sure to take you up on this!”

“And  you, Mr. Rosenberg – you also plan to join our ranks?”

“No,” Pilkin was laconic. “I intend to become an actor!”

“A fine career,” approbated Keren. “I was toying with the idea before I  picked on the law!”

“What made you prefer law?” Pilkin was no respecter of rank.

“Prudence; opting for security rather than poetry: for the sixpence – not  for the moon!”

For  a moment Jacob Keren remained lost in his thoughts. He then brought our conversation to an end,  observing   abruptly: “Interesting subjects, aren’t they? But I must really join my Learned Colleague. I think we can now  settle this wretched case sensibly. So, Chayim, let me wish you much success in  your career  on  the stage. I’ll look forward to your performances. And  you,  Eli, remember  to see me once you have decided for sure you want a career in the Law.”

Shaking hands with both of us, he made his  way rapidly to the stairway leading to the VIP section on the upper floor. Our eyes had followed him with respect. Even forty years after this chance meeting, as I was twisting  restlessly on the comfortable bed in Pension Kegel,  I recalled vividly the impact that the aging Jacob Keren  had left on young Pilkin and myself. True, on my friend the encounter had but a  transient effect. In contrast,  it exercised a profound influence over my subsequent, lengthy, career as a lawyer.
