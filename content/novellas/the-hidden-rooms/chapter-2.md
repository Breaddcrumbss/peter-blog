### 3. A Confused Day

Bill  Riggs  was  waiting for me at the arrival hall of  Terminal  3  at Heathrow Airport. He  was,  actually, looking fresher and more vigorous than he  had  ever appeared  in Singapore. For  a  short while we  gossiped  about  mutual  friends  in Singapore,  about  my forthcoming book and about his own work  in  his  London firm.  Then, as if by  prior arrangement, we turned to business. I started by expressing my doubts respecting the outcome.

“So you think that both sides have a shaky case?” Bill asked. 

“I think so. The outcome depends on the Judge’s assessment  of the truthfulness of the witnesses. If he accepts our version of the facts,  my Report is bound to convince him that we acted in the manner of reasonable  and well informed bankers.”

“And if he accepts their version?”

“We  are sunk; but, then, their case is as uncertain as ours.  Their Expert  is  bound to make a comparable concession.” Pausing for  a  moment,  I added  anxiously: “Do you agree?”

“I do. Actually, we’ve arranged a meeting  with the  other  party in our office at 3.00 pm.  It would be good if  you  could attend; they are bringing their expert. I only hope you are not too tired?”

“I slept on the ‘plane; so I should be alright.”



After  I  had unpacked my suitcase, I dropped onto the  bed  and  stared apprehensively   at  the  ivory  coloured  telephone.  Closing  my   eyes   in resignation, I picked up the receiver and dialled my home number. For a  while the telephone  kept ringing. I was about to replace the receiver when I  heard the click.

“I was sleeping!” As always, Pat’s complaining voice  irritated my ears.

“You told me to ring you as soon as I reached the hotel.”

“You didn’t tell me you will get there so early! Here it is after  midnight.”



As always,  Pat’s  nagging voice was pushing me into a corner. She was an  intelligent woman but, unfortunately, quite incapable of looking beyond  the horizon imposed by her background. A professional  man’s commitment  to matters entrusted to him had remained incomprehensible  to  her.

“Oh, all right then; ring me when you have news”.  The click of the receiver dropping back into  its cradle was music to my ears.



When  I  had  recovered, I picked the receiver, smiling  with anticipation. “So  you have arrived safe and sound in your hotel, Uncle? Do you have a  nice room?”

“A suite; and a nice one at that; but something is remiss: You are not in London”.

“We’ll soon put this right.” she was laughing happily now.

“The sooner the better; and you know I was tempted to ring  you from the ‘plane. But got confused”

“That’s not like you – I mean, when you’re on a case.”

“Not  the case; the catalogue we talked about when we last spoke; you see, the house near Woodstock: it  belonged to an old friend; the banker Arthur Smithies. Does his name ring a bell?”

“Of  course it does; you kept telling ‘her’ about him again and  again.”  Yuan Ming invariably referred to herself in days past – to the little girl of my early days in Singapore – in the third person.

“You  even drew his sketch, without having ever seen him!” I reminded her.  “I still have it; you called it: ‘Uncle’s friend Mr Arthur’.”

For a moment both of us were silent. Then, unexpectedly, she asked: “The yellow milk jug; have you really seen it before?”

“I have; it was in a catalogue he showed me when we met in 1981  in the Athenaeum.”

“No wonder it looked familiar to you;  so you came face to face with your past during  the flight. I want to know all about it. But look, Uncle,  before  you start telling me, have you had something to eat; and aren’t you tired?”

“We had breakfast on the ‘plane; but, yes, I’m tired.”

“You sound it; so have a shower and go to bed; and when are  you going up to Woodstock?”

“Tomorrow, if I can get away from the case; we have a meeting this  afternoon; a last minute attempt to settle, I suspect.”

“Then  you must have a good rest now. Ring me again when you are  back  from Woodstock. I’ll  come over soon.”



As I had anticipated, the meeting in Bill Riggs’ office failed to produce a settlement. Shortly after it started, all of us realised that the conflict was not between the two companies, which had to continue trading with  each  other, but the two executives  who had  negotiated  the  contract: Philip  Whitehead  and  Tony Blackburn. All attempt to reason with the two fighting cocks  failed. After  some  three  exasperating  hours,  in which they traded thinly veiled insults, they brought the meeting to a stormy end. 



Notwithstanding  their exasperation, Bill and his counterpart  in the  other  camp had a confidential exchange, in which each  agreed  to  explore   the possibility  of  a  sensible settlement with people at the top. Another  meeting   was,  accordingly, scheduled  for the next day.  I could not hide my relief when Bill  said, with a twinkle in his eye, that the presence of experts would not be required.



I went to bed early but, as was  to be expected, woke up in the early hours of the morning. Feeling  too comfortable  to  get  up, I kept musing  about  the role of  chance  in a man’s life.  Meandering through my life story, I recalled Fortuna’s  intervention in my early childhood, when we were refugees in Marseilles. Father had secured us  a visa to Australia but mother, who had turned an ardent Zionist  after the Anschluß, insisted that we  wait  for  another three  days  for a visa to Palestine. I often wonder how my  life  would  have proceeded if that visa had not been issued in time. What would a boyhood in Sydney have been like?

Later  on, in my teens, chance induced me to dash my mother’s  hopes  of seeing  her  only son studying medicine. A spell in the Courts of Law  in  Tel Aviv, during a break between two examinations conducted on the premises of the neighbouring Department of Education, roused my interest. Some further  visits during the long vacation convinced me that my future  was  in the Law. It amused me  to  think that, if the examinations had been held in a different  part  of town,  I  might have ended up as yet another physician who  lacked  a  genuine desire to cure the sick.

Even my unexpected decision to abandon my legal practice and read for  a doctorate in Oxford was triggered off by a chain of events beyond my  control. To  start with I had been turned down by the woman I loved. I was deflated and soon started  to  avoid my  friends. Shortly thereafter a  Judge,  whom  I respected,  told  me  I lacked  the  attributes  of  a  courtroom advocate.

I  knew that some good law  firms would gladly offer me an appropriate  backroom position. But I was too young and  too  ambitious  to compromise  and, in consequence, felt my world was caving in. When a  former classmate returned to Tel Aviv with enthusiastic accounts  of his  two  years in Oxford, I decided to apply for  admission.  Again,  Fortuna smiled: despite my indifferent  undergraduate results, my research record opened Sesame.  

My  two years in Oxford had a profound effect on my future. To a  point,  the  successful  completion  of my Oxford project  was  due  to  the devoted  guidance  of  my two supervisors and to my  own  perseverance.  Fortuna, though, had once again displayed her subtle hand. She had directed my feet  to Crawford  &  Co.  and to the office of the  firm’s  Managing  Partner,  Arthur Smithies.  Initially, his readiness to assist me was triggered off by his interest in my subject. His resolve was bolstered   when he  discovered our common interest in art.

“Coincidence”  I deliberated. “You  think  you  are in charge  and assert proudly that you  make   your  own decisions;  but  where would you be  if  Fortuna had turned her back on you?”

### 4. Reflections on the Oxford Train

Later in the morning, I took  the express train to Oxford.  As  I leafed  again through the catalogue of the forthcoming auction,  I  identified some further pieces of porcelain I had seen before. I also recognised a number of  the traditional English paintings of the estate: they  had been  displayed in Birchin Lane.

As the express train sped out of London, my thoughts centred again on my late benefactor. Some four weeks after our initial interview, I had received a parcel with documents relevant to my quest. Some came from the archives of his own   bank;  others  from  merchant  banks  that  had,  originally,  sent   me discouraging  replies; and others still were from the private  collections  of certain  families.  He had, in addition, enclosed a set of standard  forms  of letters of credit used by London banks during the 19th century. The only  task left to me was to find the connecting threads and to consider the significance of  individual clauses. Thanks  to  Arthur Smithies, I had proved my case.

Arthur  Smithies  assistance did not end there. A hand  written  letter, accompanying  the  parcel,  encouraged me to call on him when  I  came to London. During the succeeding months, we had many a lunch in Crawford &  Co.’s cafeteria  or in a nearby restaurant.



Later  in the year, I started to send him the drafts of the chapters  of my  thesis.  Naturally,  I  did so only after they  had  been  perused  by  my supervisors. By then, most blemishes had been  eliminated. Frequently,  though, Arthur  Smithies,  drew  my attention to  some  remaining  inconsistencies  of language  and  of  textual analysis and added, in the  margin,  remarks  which assisted me to further polish up my plain style.



Another indication of his goodwill was my constant receipt of catalogues of different auction houses in London. Some came houses of whose  existence I had been unaware. In time it dawned on me that a dedicated collector could,  occasionally, get real bargains at the less renowned sales rooms.  Generally, the trick  was  to sit or stand at the far end of the room, where others  did  not notice  you, and to raise your hand at the right moment. 

On some  occasions, my eye caught Arthur Smithies. I recall how, in an auction in Chelsea, I spotted him in one of the front rows, engrossed in his  catalogue and  looking as calm and as composed as ever. His expression  did  not  change when the auctioneer picked up a handsome cup and saucer. Just  a slight nod of his head indicated that he had entered the arena. Within a few seconds he  was locked in a dog fight with another front-bencher who raised his hand excitedly at  each  prompting of the auctioneer. Then, within less then  a  minute,  the skirmish  was  over. Arthur Smithies shook his had slightly and  immersed  himself  again  in  the catalogue.  I realised that Arthur Smithies was not prepared to pay more for a piece than its worth.



I  saw Arthur Smithies less regularly during the months  following  this episode.  The thesis was nearing completion. My main task during the  period was  to  verify  citations, to ensure I had not  overlooked  any  major  legal decision and, generally, to get on with the menial tasks of preparing the indices, tables of cases, a bibliography and an abstract. This type of work  was best carried out in my own room off Oxford’s Abingdon Road. But even  so,  I went up to London from time to time, occasionally  for  an auction but, more often, to consult texts which were not available in Oxford. Usually, when I finished my work in the respective reading room,   I took  a train to Bank Station in order to call on Arthur Smithies. We  had  by then  become friendly and, in many ways, a trip to London appeared  incomplete without a short meeting with him. Brian Davies was another person I used to visit  when work took me to London. Our common interest in art laid the foundation for an acquaintance.   

What had impressed me most during the entire period  was Arthur Smithies ingrained dignity and self-control. The  only  occasion on which I found him out of humour took place  on  a bleak  November  day.  I was reading The Times in the waiting  room, when a loudly dressed gentleman, smirking victoriously,  was escorted to the lift by Brian Davies, whose face was set.  As I  entered Arthur Smithies room, I was startled to see he was ruffled.

“Is something the matter, Mr Smithies?” I asked as he invited me to sit down.

“Not really” he said, after a pause. “But some customers can get under your skin.”

“May I possibly ask what happened? Is it an unpleasant default situation?”

“Nothing  like  it. If  a  customer  gets  into difficulties  without  fault,  we seek to accommodate. This  is  why  we’re  so careful when we accept new customers. No; that fellow, whom you must have seen leaving my room, was haggling with me about the rate of interest on his firm’s overdraft!”

“Is this uncommon?” I asked, surprised.

“No;  of  course not; and, again, if a customer is decent when he  raises  the matter, we bend backward to help him. It was the way he went about it.”

His  eyes  projected  indignation.  I, in turn,  feared to intrude. It seemed best to keep mum. In the event, Arthur Smithies  went on without any prompting on my part.

“I  think I told you about Timberflashings in Nova Scotia; we have been  their bankers for years and still issue all their letters of credit. It  has been  a good business relationship since the turn of the century.  But  things changed  when the firm was taken over by an American group.  I suppose it is only natural that the new owners  want to use an American bank.  I would have no right to resent that. But instead of a straight  change over they are constantly haggling with us.”

“Are they unpleasant when they do?”

“Plain rude is the word. That  fellow told me that Chase offered  them  a  line of credit at ½ per cent below ours;  and  when I said we provide  a  different  service,  including  the investigation of ventures with new potential clients, he said  they didn’t  need our help.  And the way he put it: ‘All we want  is  a cheap line of credit; and we can look after ourselves; so if your bank   can’t give  us  a better rate of interest, we’ll take our business elsewhere’.”

“What did you say?” I could not help asking.

“I needed time to control my temper; so I kept studying the file. In the end I agreed to reduce our rate by ¼ of a per cent.  When he continued to haggle,  I told  him that I couldn’t cut our profit margin any further. He said he  would think it over.”

“I believe he’ll accept” I said.

“I  think you are right” he said, regaining his composure as people  do when  they  have given vent to their feelings. Then,  with  a ghost  of  his usual smile, he added with a mental shrug: “I  suppose  he  was bluffing.  Chase  may have offered him a better rate than  ours  but  probably tagged on some extra charges. Still, this round goes to him. So be it. What  I can’t stand   is his downright  rudeness. Let  him take his business elsewhere if he wishes; he’ll soon find  out  which bank furnishes the better service; we are proud of our record!”

To my relief, Arthur Smithies dismissed the unpleasant incident from his mind  over  a  pleasant lunch in a nearby pub. As I took my  leave,  he  asked whether  I had given some thought to what I wanted to do after the  completion of my research work.

“Not really” I told him; “I've been too busy with the thesis.”

“In its final form it is fine.”

“Thanks,” was all I could bring out, adding “and thanks for all you help.”

“It has been a pleasure,” he said with his usual warm smile.



Some  five weeks after this conversation, I handed my thesis in  at  the University’s  Registry.  Dreading  the wait whilst it was being  read  by  the examiners, I decided to spend the Christmas break with my father in Vienna. We had  pleasant evenings together in the theatres, in the  two  opera houses  and in a wine-and-dine taverns in Grinzing.  During  the days, I kept roving through the antique shops. Eventually,  I found the type of  item I had been looking for: a cabinet cup and saucer, with excellent paintings  of Schloß  Schönbrunn.  It  bore the Habsburg Shield and  an  incised  number  showing that it had been produced in 1804. The colours,  though,  were still  as  fresh  as  when the pieces had come out  of  the  kiln. 



Two days later, I was on my way back to London.  The Registry at  Oxford had sent me an urgent letter, advising that my oral examination, known as  the ‘viva’, had been set for January 12.  The neatly packed cabinet vase was in my briefcase,  placed carefully under my seat at the back of the aeroplane.



When  the  examination  was over,  I got ready  to  leave  England.  The friendly expression on my examiners’ faces  had been reassuring.  After taking my leave from my supervisors,  I proceeded to London  to express my thanks to Arthur Smithies.

“So  all  is well with your thesis,” he said as soon as I entered  his  office. “But, of course, I have been confident all along; and what are your plans now?”

“I had been  thinking of  returning  to Tel  Aviv. But there has been  an  unexpected  development.  The University  of  Singapore  has offered me a post in its Faculty  of  Law.  The letter was waiting for me when I came back from Vienna.”

“Singapore?” he said, surprised.

“A  chap  who used to work in the Bodleian Law Reading Room  went there  last  year. A few months ago he urged me to apply for a  newly  created Assistant  Lectureship. They took so long about it that I assumed they  turned me down. Then, out of the blue, came the letter with the offer.”

“Have you accepted?”

“I have. I thought a few years in the East would be interesting and  the tropical climate  ought to be good for my asthma.”

“What  a strange coincidence,” he observed after a pause. “We have been planning  to  ask whether you may wish to join the Bank as a cadet. I thought it best to wait until you finished your thesis.”

“I wish I had known,” I said, crestfallen.

“It’s  alright; don’t you worry about it. Spending some time in Singapore  is a good idea. I’m sure you’ll find the East fascinating. And for how long do you plan to go?”

“They have given me a three years contract.”

“We’ll keep our offer open for that period. And we’ll take  your new  experience into account when we work out the details of  an  arrangement, that is, if you remain interested to join us in ...”.



At  that  point I was, suddenly, jolted back into the  real  world surrounding  me.  A man in uniform,  who had  just entered  the carriage, requested all passengers to have their  ticket ready for inspection. Looking out of the window,  I realised we had already passed Reading. Before long, the train stopped in Oxford.

### 5. Surprise at the Preview

For a few moments I stood undecided outside the Station. A glance at  my watch told me it was 12 noon.  After a brisk walk, I boarded the double Decker  to Woodstock, where a shuttle bus was waiting to convey idlers and enthusiasts to the  preview of the items to be sold in the auction of the estate of the  late Sir Arthur Smithies.



As  planned, I started with the  porcelain. The  yellow-ground  cream jug looked even more attractive on the  shelf  of  a mahogany  display  cabinet than in the photograph and,  despite  a  meticulous examination,  I spotted no hairline crack to its handle. It was only when I completed my inspection of the wares that it dawned on me that one item was missing. There was no trace of the cabinet cup and saucer  I had brought to my late friend from Vienna. A further march around the cabinets confirmed  the  position.  After a slight hesitation, I  stopped  one  of  the attractive attendants:

“Excuse me; I’d like to know: are there any other porcelain pieces here?”

“Only what you see in the cabinets” she said, surprised.

“Is there no Vienna cup, or cup and saucer?”

For  a  few  moments she skimmed quickly,  professionally,  through  the catalogue. When she finished, she shook her head: “No;  there’s  no  such  piece.”   

Where was  my  gift?  I remembered  vividly  how pleased he had looked when he examined  the  cup  and saucer. “It  is a lovely set, Berger. I  really like it. Thanks.”

His  delight had been genuine. Why, then, did my gift  not figure  in the  auction?  Although I had never joined the ranks of his bank and  had  met him only once after our last conversation in his office, we had kept in  touch for years. His short letters had been marked by their warmth and by his  interest in my career. He had, I was confident, remained a friend to  the end.  Dismissing my initial nagging doubts, I concluded that  Arthur  Smithies would  not  have parted with the cup and saucer.  Had they, by sheer bad luck, been broken or  stolen?



After  some time, I turned back to the rooms and started to inspect  the furniture.  Once  again  I experienced the sensation  of  unreality  that  had overcome  me on the flight  to London. The rooms looked   too  grand, too  impersonal,  to  have  constituted  a   home.  They created an ambience different from Arthur Smithies’ old office in  Birchin  Lane. Although his fine rosewood desk, the upholstered chair  and the  two paintings on the wall had produced gentrified airs, the general atmosphere  in the  room  imbued relaxed comfort. There had been  no  trace  of  the grandeur  that marked the rooms in his Woodstock abode.



In  an attempt to solve the riddle, I had a close look at the paintings on the walls. Most were English hunting scenes and galleons braving  stormy seas. Then, as I cast my eye on three  frames  mounted one above the other on a narrow wall, I froze in my steps. Sandwiched irreverently  between two common hunting scenes, hung an art work I had good reason to recognise.  The small  abstract  study in colours entitled ‘Dawn’ was singed ‘Yuan-Ming, S’ore 1981’.” I had stood by her side when she had put the  finishing touches to it.



For a while, the world kept spinning around me. When it steadied, I  had another close look at the drawing  to ensure I had not experienced a mirage.  A light  touch of the fine rice paper with my finger tips settled any  remaining doubt.  I had come face to face with a work executed by Yuan Ming .



My friendship with young Yuan  Ming and  her  brilliant father, the antiques dealer Tay Fang-Shuo  alias  Dr  Alfred Cheng, M.A., Ph.D. (Cantab), is a saga of its own. I had met them by chance in  1962, when  my  feet led me to their  shop  in  the  heart  of Singapore’s  old China Town. The tasteful display of artefacts in  their  show window  had prompted me to cross the threshold although, at that time,  I  had not developed  an interest in Chinese antiques.

Within  a  few months I had become a close friend of the  father,  whose profound  understanding  of  both  Chinese  and  European  art  amazed me. I had also become Yuan Ming’s favourite uncle. I  used to help her with her home work, taught her to swim and, occasionally, when Tay and  his  wife  attended functions in their temple, took her for  a  drive  to Johore Bahru or Kota Tinggi. Shortly after her tenth birthday, she started  to frequent  my office in the University, arriving by taxi straight from  school. At the beginning, Tay and I were concerned for her safety. To  soothe  us,  she promised to stop a taxi only if she knew the driver.

It  was  at  about  that time that I  discovered  Yuan  Ming’s  artistic talents. Even before then, I had been aware of her preoccupation with  colours and of her ability to recall the very finest shades of  paintings on ceramics. On one occasion, when I challenged her,  she  drew  an exact replica of a polychrome vase I had purchased on my first visit  to their shop.



Later on, she showed me a  small sketchbook with her drawings, insisting that I tell no one  about it. In  the event, it had taken me ten months to persuade Yuan Ming to  share  our secret  with  Tay.  By  then, she had developed  into  a   skilled  and imaginative  young artist.



We remained close even after I married a local Chinese girl in 1963. For a reason I have never managed to work out, I kept my friendship with the Tays to myself. Still, my stand was right. To forestall a storm that would have followed her discovery of this friendship,  I reduced my trips to Chinatown from three to two  per week. In the event, no cloud appeared on the horizon during my days at the University. Then, to my dismay, I lost touch with my friends after I left Singapore in 1966.



Years later, I stumbled into their new shop during a year I spent as Visiting Professor in the old institution, by then  renamed ‘the National University of Singapore’. To my relief,  our friendship had stood  the test of the lengthy period of separation. Soon I was, once  again,  making  my pilgrimage to their shop two or three times a week. Tay, alas, was looking frail and, except when we  talked  about art  and ceramics, remained withdrawn. But, even so, I was  glad  to understudy him again.



By then, Yuan  Ming, whom I recalled as a young teenager, had  bloomed  into  an attractive  self assured woman. She was just as lively and as active  as my  little friend used to be but had learned to hide her nerves behind a  calm and dignified front. Although  she was too small to be considered a beauty,   she still  had  her  big black eyes, her luscious long hair and,  above  all,  the directness of manner that had captivated my heart in days gone bye.



As I had expected, she remained devoted to art.   After a short spell in Cambridge, she moved to Los Angeles. By  the  time  I rediscovered them, she had become a  reasonably  well  known  artist, shuttling  between California  and Singapore and spending her breaks in  the PRC, where she mastered the finer details of Chinese painting.



Conceptually,  her  work manifested maturity.  To  my  disappointment, though, her brushes had  lost  some  of  their original  freshness: gone was her rare ability to create shapes by a  skilful manipulation of the finer shades of their colours. She was,  instead, using  a  technique  involving the execution of  clear  lines  outlining  each individual  subject.  With the exception of occasional pieces,  in  which  she employed  her  earlier skills, I thought the work of the adolescent  girl  had been superior to  the  work  of the mature young artist.  Undoubtedly,  the  latter’s stroke  and  handling  of  the  brush had reached  new  heights;  so  did  the composition of her drawings and paintings. All the same, something was remiss.



Yuan Ming spotted  my misgivings  straightaway. After a while, she  came  up with a suggestion.

“You  say your wife is going to spend a few weeks with her church  friends  in Tainan?”

“She is; so we can go to Changi Point a few extra times; and how about a quick trip to Sydney? You’ll love Circular Quay and Balmain.”

“I can’t leave Dad alone; not at the moment. But how about a full day painting safari? There is a lovely spot in the Bukit Timah  Reserve. Why  don’t  I  pick you up in Pandan Valley at about 6.00 o’clock on  Sunday. You can manage to get up early, once upon a time, can’t you, Respected Uncle?”



‘Dawn’   was  drawn   that    Sunday,  by  a  brook  on the slope of a hill. Yuan Ming had  used  her Chinese brush, dipping it in the ink-pots and executing each stroke with a single confident movement of her hand.

She kept working spontaneously, without a pause, just as she used to  do in the old days. Then, after what appeared to me an eon but was in reality but a  short  span  of some thirty minutes,  she nodded her  head  and  said  with satisfaction: “That’s that; let’s see what you think of it.”

Turning my head, I took in my breath in. The liquid shapes, outlined by the colours  alone,  sparkled in the gentle morning sun. She  had  captured the very moment of dawn, with the sun emerging in the horizon,   with the rays of soft light engulfing the branches of the  trees  and caressing the transparent water in the brook. A man and a small girl,  sitting on his lap with her arm around his shoulders,  were displayed in silhouette in the  background.  The  masterfully  executed  drawing  created   an atmosphere of lightness and harmony.

“What do you think of it?”

“It’s  beautiful;  just  plain beautiful” I told her. The  perfection  of  her stroke and of the composition compensated for the one and only shortcoming  of the brilliant work: the colours were not as effervescent and as  imaginatively employed as in her works of days gone bye. I knew, however, that she was  once again on the right track.



To my relief, she did not ask any questions. Having signed the sheet  of rice  paper,  she stamped  it with her ‘chop’ –  the classic  Chinese  artist’s seal – and wrote “Dawn” in the margin.



Later in the day, after she had rested, Yuan Ming went back to her easel.  The finished work showed a middle aged man and a young woman, admiring a  small brook  fermenting in the hot sun. In the background, a girl in her early teens and a young man were smiling at them.

“Yuan Ming” I begged; “please, let me have it. I know what you are telling us.”

“It’s yours” she affirmed with a smile; “shall I name it ‘Ablaze at Noon’?”

“Of course” I assured her; “an is it part of set?”

“It’s  meant  to be; but I’m too tired to draw the other two today;  they  are ‘Dusk’ and ‘Stormy Night’. I’ll have a go next week.”



Yuan Ming displayed the full set in her next exhibition in Los  Angeles. She placed a ‘sold’ tag on ‘Ablaze at Noon’. ‘Dusk’ and ‘Stormy Night’ were snapped up by a New York art dealer. ‘Dawn’ was purchased by an Englishman, described by Yuan Ming as a ‘real  cute  gentleman, mildly spoken, conservatively dressed and not  at  all stuffy: a kindly sort of fellow with a twinkle in his eye.’

So ‘Dawn’ had been acquired by Arthur Smithies. He was an art connoisseur. But, then, why was this masterpiece   hanging on this ridiculous  wall,  sandwiched between  two  dull  oils? Trying hard to hide my wrath, I proceeded resolutely to the shuttle bus.



Back in the hotel, I dropped on the bed for a nap before dinner.  When I woke  up, the room was pitch dark: I had slept some six hours. Realising  Yuan Ming was waiting, I grabbed the receiver:

“I’ve been waiting for your call. You alright, Uncle? Where have you been?”

“Asleep  on the bed; I just dozed off when I came back from Woodstock.”

“Dozed off with all your clothes on?”

“Well, yes. Sorry to have given you a fright.”

“Something wrong?” she asked anxiously.

“No” I told her; “but the house in Woodstock is upsetting.”

“Let’s hear about it.”

Suppressing  my  discovery  of ‘Dawn’, I dwelt on the  missing  cup  and saucer and the incongruity of the rooms.

“So you think this was not Arthur Smithies’ type of house?”

“It wasn’t; and he wouldn’t have parted with my gift.”

“But people change.”

“I  know;  but I didn’t think it would happen to him. Still, I  suppose  I  am making too much of it: a storm in a tea cup.”

“I wouldn’t say that; but is this all, Uncle?”

“Well ... just about it,” I prevaricated. “But look, when will you be here?”

“Soon; I’ll call your when I’m in Chelsea” she replied, referring to a flat  she had acquired some five years earlier on.

### 6. Reunion

Next morning I put in my  appearance in Bill Riggs’ office. As expected, neither camp  had  assumed  the courage to cross swords with its own fighting cock. Disgusted, I spent the day polishing up my Expert’s Report, incorporating in it references to yet another bundle  of  documents that had materialised from nowhere. When I  finished,  I took  a train to Knightsbridge, to make some purchases. After dinner, I prepared myself for the meeting with Counsel.



This  meeting  took  almost the entire day. When  it was  over, I went back to the hotel. A voice message conveyed that Yuan Ming had arrived in her flat. She  had taken the long flight from Los Angeles in her stride. Her smile greeted me when I entered the restaurant, in which she had booked a table. Having placed our orders, she enquired about my case. I, in turn, was eager to hear about the details of her forthcoming exhibition. Relieved to hear that everything was in place, I proceeded to ask about her personal life. To my dismay, it turned out that she and her latest boyfriend had split.





Instantly, I felt a pang – not the reaction of a suitor, but the quiet ache of a father, who fears that his daughter may grow old and alone after  he’s gone. I then concluded that Yuan Ming was still dreaming about a perfect spouse. A dependable, considerate and charming man, who would give her interests a higher priority than his own: an ideal man and perfect spouse. I suspected such paragons of virtue could be found in literature but not in real life. Still, Tay and I had persuaded young Yuan Ming that art did not tolerate compromises. She sought to apply the same unbending yardstick to  her personal life.



It seemed best to change the subject. For a while, we recalled anecdotes of the old days in China Town. We then  discussed my forthcoming appearance as Expert Witness and, eventually, turned back to her imminent exhibition.  

“So everything is alright now” I concluded.

“With my exhibition –  yes, Uncle, it is. But I  do want to know what went wrong when you went to Woodstock; I  know there  is something you’re hiding from me. So why not tell me? It’s  something you saw in that silly house – isn’t that so, Uncle?”

“There is something; but, please, please, let me tell you later.”

“When?”

“After your exhibition!”

“After  my  exhibition?  But  I’m  coming with you  to  the  next  preview  in Woodstock;  so I’ll sure see for myself. So why not tell me now?”

She  was,  of course, right.  My design of steering her  away  from  the undignified  wall  was now bound to fail; perhaps it had been unsound  at  its inception. Without waiting for my reply, she sped on: “I thought it had something to do with the house; so I went through that silly catalogue  of  yours till I got a splitting headache. But I  couldn’t  find  a thing.  And look here, Uncle; I don’t see how furniture or ceramics  can  have anything to do with me. So it must be a drawing.”

“So that’s it,” she said when she had taken in the change in my expression. “You came across one of my drawings. But  what’s so terrible about that?”

“It’s they way they treated it” I said bitterly, and without further prompting told  her what had taken place in the preview, keeping from her only that  the painting was ‘Dawn’.

“Uncle,”  she  said when I had finished, “don’t you see you are being unreasonable?”

“Unreasonable?”  I  spluttered angrily. “They placed  your work of art between  two ludicrous 19th century paintings, executed by a Philistine of  an unskilled  amateur.”

“But who arranged the preview items?”

“Some nincompoop!” 

“So  that’s  it, Uncle. Somebody insulted your Yuan Ming by keeping her work in the shadow. Somebody  you  don’t  even know. And off you go, hitting the roof.”

“I did not hit the roof! I remained  as cool as cucumber.”

“With  flashing  eyes? I  can  just imagine the scene. Remind me to have a good look at the cucumbers when we next shop in Harrods’ Food Stalls!”

“They  don’t sell them there,” I said weakly. “But, honestly, I don’t  see  how you can take this bullshit so calmly.”

"But,  Uncle, if you had kept your cool, you could have offered them more than the upper estimate  and walked away with it.”

“It never occurred to me.”

“No, you were too angry, Uncle. And to think that Dad and I tried to teach you to take things easy! But, it doesn’t matter.  Only next  time don’t you hide things from me and don’t  give me a fright.”

### 7. A Rising Young Banker

Back in my hotel room, my mind reverted to my days as a research student. Banking practice entailed field research, which drove me to  London. Notwithstanding its high academic profile, Oxford had never become a commercial centre. Further, some books were not available there.



In all my spells n Lodon, a call on the building in Birchin Lane was imperative. Indeed, the walk from the Middle Temple Library, which housed the best American  law books collection in Britain, to Birchin Lane became a pilgrimage. Usually, my object was to call on Sir Arthur Smithies. But yet another friendship – with Brian Davies – was in the making.

Initially, it was a formal acquaintanceship. True, I knew that, like myself, Brian was interested in art. We talked about famous painters and draftsmen when he led me to Arthur Smithies’ office or to the adjacent waiting room. I knew, further, that Arthur Smithies trusted Brian Davies implicitly. All the same, he was in my eyes an appendage – something in the nature of a personal assistant or of body guard – to Arthur Smithies, the head of Crawfords.

This impersonal link turned into a much closer relationship after I ran into him one day over lunch. I was looking for a table in Lyons Corner House when Brian Davies – who had spotted me before my eye fell on him – asked me to join his table. He was lunching with a plain looking and conservatively dressed girl, a few years younger than himself.



Following the introduction, Ruth Brown observed that Brian had told her a lot about me. From the brief exchange that followed, I gathered that Ruth was aware of my background and that Brian had referred to  my research topic as well as to my interest in porcelain and in prints.

“A largely academic interest at this stage,” I confided. “Good pieces are well beyond my reach.”

“But I’m sure the right day will come,” she responded. “And, like Brian, you are getting ready for it.”



We went on chatting. Ruth, I realised, was not the flamboyant type of girl a man would date in anticipation of a good time or a casual affair. She was a homely girl with a traditional outlook on life. Her strength was in her character. She had the makings of a steady  wife and a good mother. She would be proud to look after her husband, to bring up a solid family and to run a  good home.



“Where have the two of you met?” I took the courage to ask.

“In a Christmas party given by Crawfords,” she told me willingly. “One of the secretaries asked me over.”



Ruth was curious about my background. She wanted to find out as much as possible about Israel and, in particular, about Jerusalem. To my relief, she did not ask any personal questions. I, too, steered carefully.  Ruth, though, was forthcoming. She told me  that her father was the foreman of small industrial firm, that she had two brothers and two sisters and that the family home was on the outskirts of greater London. It took her more than an hour to commute to the city, where she was employed as a teller in a local bank. In contrast to her, Brian did not volunteer any information about his own background. Still, from a casual observation I gathered he shared a flat in Marble Arch with some friends.



I saw more of Brian and Ruth in the course of the ensuing months. Occasionally we lunched together in one of the inexpensive eateries in the City. Some other times we had afternoon tea together. Usually, Brian led the conversation to art. His interest was mainly in modern prints of French based artists. He disliked the German expressionist  I admired and found ceramics uninspiring. Ruth, invariably, kept out of the conversations but did her best to feign interest. She came to life  when the three of us went to a matinee or an  early evening show in Piccadilly.



I had no doubt these two would get married before long. They would – I sensed – enjoy a happy marriage and bring up a large family.  What baffled me was that they kept postponing their day. Did one of the families raise objections?



The real reason for the waiting period emerged one day, when I spotted them in a Wimpy Bar in Holborn. To my surprise, both looked out of countenance. Brian tried to clear his expression as  soon as he spotted me but Ruth remained  overtly distressed. Initially, I thought it best to ignore the clouds and appear at ease. But I had come to know them too well to  prevaricate.

“Is something the matter?” I asked.

“Not really” said Brian, whilst Ruth’s face remained set. “We have been  making our plans for the future but always come up against a snag.”

“What is it?”

“We want to have a place of our own,” Ruth came to life. “But we can’t afford something suitable and comfy! We have enough for a nice house way out London or some crummy property closer to the City.”

“A Hobson’s Choice,” agreed Brian. “I hate the idea of commuting – wasting some two or three hours on the train day in and day out; and I know all about lousy accommodation!”

“I understand,” I pressed on. “But look, you’re Arthur Smithies right hand man. Can’t you …”

“ … I’ve been telling Brian to have a chat with him,” interposed Ruth.

“But Crawfords does not grant housing loans. Arthur Smithies might make an exception, but he won’t think the better of me,” Brian had spoken firmly.

“But couldn’t he introduce you to a building society?”

“We can approach one of them directly,” explained Brian; “but, Peter, we don’t have enough for a deposit.”



The subject of housing continued to crop up in many later conversations. In the end, Fortuna came to their aid. One of Brian’s colleagues was granted a fellowship by an American University. He asked Brian and Ruth to take care of his flat in Bayswater during the two years he planned to spend overseas. This enabled them to tie the knot. I was one of the few guests invited to their modest ceremony. Another guest was Sir Arthur Smithies.



The memory of that delightful occasion remained fresh in my mind over the years. Stretched comfortably on my bed in the hotel following my evening with Yuan Ming, I kept meandering about what I knew of Brian’s later  career. I had been out of touch with him for a long time. But the snippets that had trickled through, suggested he had done well.

### 8. ‘Dawn’ and Mr Smithies

Next morning I called on Bill Riggs in order to discuss some aspects of our case. Just before lunch I went over to Chelsea. This time we proceeded to Soho, to a restaurant in the heart of Chinatown. For a while we talked about Yuan Ming’s flat in Katong. I had been looking after it since my return to Singapore. When we were done, Yuan Ming reverted to the forthcoming auction in Woodstock.

“Uncle, my drawing in Woodstock – is it ‘Dawn’?"

“Well ... yes, it is. I was going to tell you on the way to the preview.”

“No wonder you imploded; you loved it and wanted to have it.”

“I did; still do: but you have to exhibit and sell your best pieces.”

“Yes,  I  know.”   Opening  her  sketchbook, she  went  on:  “Is  this  Arthur Smithies?”



It was an excellent portrait of my late friend. Looking older than  when I  had seen him last, in the Athenaeum, he appeared slightly stooped  and  his shoulders  sagged more  pronouncedly than I recalled. What impressed me  most, though,  was his expression.  Although it registered his usual composure and benevolence,  Yuan  Ming’s  sketch brought to  the  front  an  aura  of independence  verging on lonesomeness. She had portrayed a self-assured  man, whose  pride  saved  him  from any manifestation – perhaps  even  the  inner admission – of failure. He appeared too proud, too constant,  to  feel sorry  for  himself or to become disenchanted with life; but his  face reflected no inner happiness.



“It’s him alright” I told her. “But it’s not the way I saw him.”

“Where do we differ?”

“First, I thought there was something grand about him; you  don’t display this. Secondly, I didn’t sense his loneliness, although I  recognised that he was very much his own man.”

“You knew him when he was considerably younger and, I suspect, when he was  at his peak. I, Uncle, saw an aging man, determined to retain his self-assurance and  dignity. I think you told me that his bank was taken over by an  American multinational; perhaps this brought his heyday to an end.”

“And  there  is  one other point,” I told her. “You sketched a confirmed  old  bachelor.  I used to think he had a  wife  and  children.  The biography in the catalogue came as a surprise!”

“What  on  earth made you think he was married, Uncle? I knew  he was single.”

“To start with, something in his mannerism projected the airs of a family  man. And, in any event, a  dependable and warm hearted man like him was  bound to attract women who wanted to set up a steady home and enjoy a good family life.”

“I  spotted the latter element; not the former. But, of course,  not  every man who attracts women gets hooked. And, Uncle, you saw him in his bank, which he  must  have  treated as his family. No  wonder  you confused the issues. But, then, did he ever mention a wife or family?”

“Coming  to  think of it, he didn’t. All I knew was that, in  those  days,  he lived  in  Mayfair. I had assumed that he was  too reserved to talk about his  personal life.”

“Perhaps this was what he wanted you to think! No, Uncle, the element of  self-sufficiency, of loneliness,  portrayed in my sketch told its own tale. I  knew he  was a nice and kindly man; but he wasn’t prepared to give up one single  shred of his personal freedom.”

“Did anything he say reinforce your conclusion?”

“Not  what he said, but what he didn’t say.  Most men who buy a piece tell me their wife  would love it or that it’s just what she wants for their  sitting  room. Some  even  say  they’ll come back to have a second look  with  ‘the  missis’; others talk about their daughter or son, and tell me proudly how talented they are and how they, too, like to draw; but not Arthur Smithies. He spoke like an art  critic  or a connoisseur. He understood what I was trying to do;  and  he appreciated it; but he remained detached. So I knew.”

“Please, tell me all about your encounter with Arthur Smithies.”

“He  turned  up on the last day of the exhibition, in the  late  afternoon.  I suspect  he  didn’t plan to visit us but dropped in by chance.  He  stopped at the entrance like someone who hadn’t made up his mind;  for  a while he looked around him and only then stepped in. Most viewers were already gone,  so  I  watched  him. You see, Uncle, we don’t  get  many  patrons  from Britain;  and  so  I was intrigued.”

“What did you do?”

“I kept watching him. He was not impressed with the mainstream of my works. But he showed interest when he looked at the other paintings, where I used ‘her’ old technique.  When  he reached  the  set we drew in the Bukit Timah Reserve, his  expression  changed altogether:  it became animated and, Uncle, he broke into an  appreciative  smile. He moved closer to see the title of the  drawings, took a few steps back to look at each drawing from a  distance, came closer again and then turned around like somebody requiring attention. So I walked over and asked if I could help him.”

“Did you tell him you were the artist?”

“No,  I  didn’t; but he knew straight away; don’t ask me how. He  first  asked where I had drawn these pieces. He then  raised questions about the  technique and,  very  discreetly, inquired where I got my training. He was  not  surprised  when I told him I used a Chinese technique but Western concepts.  I suspect he had worked that out for himself.”

“How do you know he grasped the subjects and the ideas behind them?”

“I  asked if he wanted me to explain. He said he thought he understood what  I was aiming at and, rather shyly, ran through the four drawings and said he would like to get any piece still available.”

“So what did you do?”

“I told him that ‘Dawn’ was available. He jumped at it  and – you know – declined the 15% discount I offered him.”



So Arthur Smithies had not changed his benign life philosophy. Even years after he became my mentor, he was willing to spend time or money on what appeared supportable  in his eyes.



“Did he contact you again?”

“He did.  First I got a Christmas card, in which he  told  me  ‘Dawn’  graced his sitting room. A  few  months later,  he  sent me a handwritten note, saying that a well  known  London  art critic had seen ‘Dawn’ and thought well of it. A Christmas card, which he sent two years later, mentioned that ‘Dawn’ was admired in  an exclusive show of contemporary art.”

“Did you reply?”

“He  never  gave  an address; so I assumed he intended to keep it  a  one  way correspondence. But, Uncle, that show had an effect on my career! You remember I  told you I had been invited to send drawings and sketches to a  well  known gallery in Paris and to another in Amsterdam?”

“Of course.”

“Well, the owners of the two  galleries got interested in my work when they saw ‘Dawn’.”



So cause and effect had played their role. Still, chance – my beloved Fortuna – had directed Arthur Smithies’ feet to the exhibition in Los Angeles. Without her intervention, ‘Dawn’ may have remained unrecognised. Yet another fine painting ignored by collectors.



“Was ‘Dawn’ his first preference?”

“He  said  so. When I asked ‘why’, he answered: ‘I admire the harmony  in  the composition and the blending of the scenery with the dreams of the little girl and the man’s aspirations for her.’ I had the feeling, Uncle, that, for just a moment,  he lost his detachment and, perhaps, was talking to himself. But look, Uncle, I must really go ahead with that call to Hong Kong. Why don’t you order  our meal while I make it?"



Yuan  Ming used her handphone. At first she  spoke  in Cantonese but soon switched to Mandarin. I concluded that she was  negotiating with two parties: a Hong Kong businessman and a Mainland Chinese, who came  to the Colony to clinch the deal. Instantly, I felt my usual apprehension for her safety. Would the pitcher go to the well once to often?  

To  calm  my  nerves, I tried to concentrate on Yuan  Ming’s  sketch  of Arthur Smithies. A closer scrutiny convinced me that it was satirical.  She had  contrasted his declining physique with his urge to maintain the  pose  of days  past. 

Like  all  her other portraits, Yuan Ming’s sketch  of  Arthur  Smithies reflected  her wit  and  objectivity. It was not malicious.   My image of him differed because I had hero worshipped  him.  My  tinted  glasses  had obliterated  the  dents  in Arthur Smithies’ armour –  the flaws that had  been  discerned  by Yuan Ming’s impartial eye.



Her  diagnosis  of Arthur Smithies in his later years was borne  out  by what  I  had  gleaned  from other sources. My  own  communications  with  him, following my departure from England, had been too tenuous to enable me to form a  clear impression. All I knew was that he had retained his elegant style  of writing and his sharp  but constructive critical facility. I knew also that he had  remained  well  inclined  toward  me.  That  much  transpired  from  our correspondence. But his letters and occasional cards told me little about  his own life and plans.



Fixing  my  eyes on Yuan Ming’s sketch,  I asked myself  whether  Arthur Smithies  had always been as she saw him or whether a subtle change,  produced by  the ravages of time, had turned the man I knew into the replica  portrayed by  her?  Seeking  to  find  an  answer,  I  commenced  to  rove  through  our communications following my departure from England.



Shortly  after  my  arrival  in Singapore I had sent  him  a  number  of postcards with scenes of the town. He, in turn, kept sending me cuttings  from catalogues.  Later on, during my second year in Singapore, I wrote  to  advise him  that I had decided to remain in academia. Quite apart from the  liking  I had  developed for my new abode and its mild tropical climate, I had  by  then cemented my friendship with Tay and  Yuan Ming. I was too  happy to  yearn  for a career in grey and eternally drizzling London. He sent  me  a charming reply, using the occasion to attach some comments on an article I had published in an English periodical.



Toward the end of the same year, I went for a short spell to Vienna and for just one  week to London. Naturally, I went down to Crawford & Co but,  to my disappointment, Arthur Smithies was out of town. Brian Davies, too, was unavailable.



I  made  my next attempt to see him during my study leave.  A  fortnight after our arrival in London.  I  was about to enter  the  building n Birchin Lane   when,  to  my amazement,  I  saw that the old and elegant placard had been replaced  by  the insignia   of  the First National City Trust Co. Inc., a well  known  American multinational  bank.  For a while I stared at it  dumbfounded.  Then,   hidden beneath  the  large letters of the new owners’ name, I spotted a  small  brass table. It read: ‘Formerly Crawford & Co. –  founded 1756.’

When I recovered, I stepped in. The new Head Porter, who used to be  the second in command, recognised me instantly.

“We haven’t seen you here for a while, Sir.”

“I’ve been away, in Singapore. Congratulations on your promotion.”

“Thank  you, Sir; thank you. You look well, if I may say so. Must be nice  and warm out there in the East.”

“It is indeed. But tell me please, is Mr Smithies available?”

“I am afraid he is no longer with us, Sir.”

“Do you know whether he is in London?”

“I believe he is in Scotland. Mr Brian Davies may have his address.”

“Is he still with the bank?”

“He is indeed. Shall I let him know you are here?”



Brian  Davies had put on weight and projected the image of a  successful executive  on his way up. After a drink in his office, we went for lunch. Over the first course, we  exchanged  our personal news. I was delighted to learn that Brian had been appointed the Head of the Overseas Department –  a fine achievement for a man in his mid thirties. Brian, though, did not tell me much about his post. He was, rather,   eager to talk about his domestic life.

“Mary Jane arrived over two years ago,” he said proudly. “She talks quite a bit already. And we are told our next one will  be a boy. He is due soon.”

“Congratulations,” I said warmly; “do you intend to have a large family?”

“Jonathan  will  have to be the last; Ruth is having a tough time. I  wish  we were living closer to the City so that I could go home for lunch.”

“I thought you had intended to buy a house in Bayswater when your landlord came back from the States?”

“We still couldn’t afford a good house in inner London; so we settled on a house  in Stanmore.”

“Where exactly is Stanmore?”

“I keep forgetting you are not from these pArt, Peter,” he chuckled. “Stanmore is on the outskirts,  just within greater London. Forty minutes by train.” 

“That’s a long ride.”

“Some of my colleagues commute from as far as Oxford!”



As before, Brian enjoyed his food. Still, when  the waiter had served the main course,  Brian  turned,  at long last, to the subject I was most interested in.

“You  must wonder what has happened to the old bank? Did Arthur Smithies  tell you about the takeover?”

“I  received  his last letter about half a year ago; and ‘no’, he  didn’t  say anything about a takeover.”

“They  were  still negotiating  at that time; I suspect he  thought  the  deal would fall through.”

“What actually happened?”

“You  could call it a ‘palace revolution’, although a ‘family  skirmish’  is more to the point.”

“I am not sure I understand.”

“You knew that Crawford & Co.  was a partnership, didn’t you?” Without waiting for  my  reply, he went on. “Arthur Smithies had the biggest  share.  All  the other  partners  were  members  of the two  families:  the  Smithies  and  the Crawfords.  Well,  some  of them started to get concerned about  the  drop  in profits.”

“I thought the bank was doing well?”

“In some ways it did. New clients from Germany, Belgium and  the  Netherlands  were investing their funds with us. This, incidentally,  was  why Arthur Smithies was  keen to have you join us: he needed somebody to  handle our German speaking clientele. Still, at the other end of the scale, we   were losing some of our older clients, like Timberflashings. Crawfords  was too small to stem the onslaught  of some of the foreign banks. Arthur Smithies’ idea of gradually transforming the firm  into  an  investment bank was sound: the private  investor’s  first  two priorities  are  ‘the  personal  touch’ and  confidentiality.  Here  the   multinationals cannot compete with the small  aristocratic  banks.”

“So what went wrong?”

“The  family  partners became too impatient; and too greedy. All they  saw  was  the periodic  fall in profits. Some asked Arthur Smithies to buy them out but,  of course,  demanded  too much. When he refused, one of them approached  First National.  It  was  common knowledge that they were looking for  a  target  in London  and,  as expected, they jumped at the opportunity.  Initially,  Arthur Smithies  sought to fend them off. Regrettably, some family partners tried to use  the take-over  bid  as  a club to beat a better price for their  holdings  out  of Arthur Smithies.”

“He would not have appreciated that!”  said I.

“He hated it! Some eighteen years ago, when Crawfords went through a post  War crisis,  Arthur Smithies  gave up his practice at the Bar  and  took over  the  management of the Bank. He salvaged it. I  am  told that nobody said: ‘thank you’. This may not have mattered to him then; perhaps he  didn’t expect a show of gratitude. But he took a dim view of the  family’s conduct  during the last few years. In the end, he made his own deal with  our new  masters.  Being an honest man he looked also after the interests  of  the rest:  but he made his own decision and put the remaining partners   before  a fait accompli.”

“How did they take it?”

“With  varying degrees of ill grace. Although Arthur Smithies secured  a  fair deal,  they felt slighted because he had not consulted them. I  believe  their resentment was the real cause of an ugly scene, made by  the son of one of one partners and the daughter of another.”

“What happened?”

“The two – who I think are engaged to be married –   turned  up one morning.  The young man, who was in  a  foul  mood, started  by  voicing  his unhappiness with the deal and  then  accused  Arthur Smithies  of  making  an unfair profit out of it.  You  see,  Arthur  Smithies bargained for a termination bonus based on the loss of the salary paid to  him as  the bank’s managing partner. The young man argued that this sum was  taken out of the price payable for the assets so that its payment reduced the amount due to each partner for his share.”

“What did Arthur Smithies say?”

“I  could  see he was taken aback. But, even so, he tried to explain  to  them that it was a severance payment, to remunerate him for his years of service to the bank –  a golden handshake. I believe the girl accepted this. She must have realised  how deeply Arthur Smithies had been offended and wanted to  avoid  a family  quarrel.  Unfortunately, the young man wouldn’t be silenced.  He  told Arthur  Smithies  that  he  had taken legal advice  and,  on  its  basis,  was satisfied  that  the  payment was in the nature of a bribe!  He  concluded  by saying: ‘This is not something the family expected from you, our upright uncle Arthur!’.”

“The bloody cheek! What did Arthur Smithies do?”

“You  should have seen his face. For just a moment I feared he would lose  his temper  and  yell  at them. Then, within a matter of seconds,  he  managed  to control  himself and just kept staring at them in silence. When he had  cooled down,  he said in a measured tone: ‘As you have already consulted  your  legal advisers,  the  matter  has to be settled through them. I  shall  refer  their letter  to  my  own  solicitors.  And now I have to  get  ready  for  my  next appointment; so please excuse me. Mr Davies will show you out’.”

“You must have felt very awkward to be in the middle?”

“I was too absorbed in what was going on to think of myself.”

“And so did you just see them out?”

“Not  immediately.  The  girl    said  they  were  only repeating the lawyer’s opinion. Arthur Smithies did not bother to reply.  Then the  young man asked if there was any message for his father. Arthur  Smithies replied: ‘So he is a party to this affront. Very well, then. You can tell  him that  I shall sign the take-over agreement on the appointed day. Under  clause 17,  the  agreement  comes  into operation only if it is  signed  by  all  the partners  within  the immediately following ten days. If they do not  sign,  I shall  take  the necessary steps to dissolve the partnership. And now  I  must really  ask you to leave.’ The young man said: ‘As you wish.’ The  girl  tried again  to salvage the situation. She mentioned the high  esteem  in which Arthur Smithies was held by the family and said  he had always  been  her favourite uncle. When she finished, Arthur Smithies said:  ‘What  a pity it has all come to end in this way.’ He then picked  up  the file lying in front of him and immersed himself in it. They then left.”

“Was there a sequel?” I wanted to know.

“Not  that I know of. By the end of the ten days period, all the partners  had signed on the dotted line.”

“What  I  can’t  understand is how any responsible solicitor  could  tell  his client that  a ‘golden handshake’ constituted  a bribe? That young  ass must have consulted an octogenarian!”

“No,  Peter:  he consulted a law student!” Noting my amazement,  Brian  Davies went  on:  “When I saw them out of the building the girl chided her fiancé  for his  rudeness. He had been asked to reason with uncle Arthur, with the  object of  convincing him to pay a percentage of his ‘golden handshake’ over  to  the family. Nobody had asked him to stage a confrontation. Well, her words cut  no ice with that chap. Appearing quite unruffled, he told her that he was certain a  ‘nice  old stick’ like their worthy uncle Arthur would do the  right  thing after  thinking  the  matter over. He would be scared by  the  damage  to  his ‘bloody  reputation’. She retorted that uncle Arthur hadn’t looked  frightened to  her.  She  then scolded the young man for alleging they  had  consulted  a lawyer,  when  all he did was to discuss the matter with a  law student in Cambridge. The young man muttered he still thought  Arthur Smithies would cave in; to which she replied: ‘We’ll see’.”

“And they had this row in front of you, Brian?”

“Quite so. You see, Peter, these young rich upstArt, with their arrogance and bloody airs, regard somebody in my position as a sort of a butler.  So they take no notice of my presence. Still, I didn’t repeat what  I had  heard  to Arthur Smithies: he would not have wanted to know and,  in  any event, it would have made no difference. He had decided to sever his ties with the family there and then; and I don’t blame him.”

“What  happened to Arthur Smithies after the completion of the take-over.  The porter told me he was in Scotland.”

“He  declined an offer for a non-executive directorship of First National  but considered an offer to join another bank –  an emerging investment bank with  a background  similar to Crawfords’.” He hesitated for a moment and then  added, slightly  embarrassed: “I think you can guess who they are. Then  came  the offer to  put  him  in  charge  of  the restructuring of CBC Corporation...”

“Who are they?”

“A substantial  industrial firm; the main shareholder is the Crown. About  one year  ago the Annual General Meeting resolved to relocate the headquarters  to Edinburgh.  Arthur  Smithies appeared the right man to be put  in  charge.  He considered  the proposition for a fortnight and accepted. I suspect he  wanted to be away for a period.”

“Did  he  look after the interests of his old employees?” I  asked,  wondering what would have been my fate had I joined Crawford & Co.

“He  did us proud! You realise all of us had been handpicked by him.  He  knew some would not fit in with the new management. So he interviewed each employee  to  see if he wanted to remain in the bank or preferred  to  make  a move.  Quite a few of the old guard got excellent jobs in other banks  in  the City through him. I could  have moved to Brownlows but decided to stay put. If you had joined  us, he  would  have  secured  you an opening in one  of  the  established  foreign investment banks.”

“So, by and large, it was a painless take-over.”

“For everybody, except, I think, for Arthur Smithies himself,” concluded  Brian Davies.



A  few  days  after  that lunch with Brian Davies,  I  wrote  to  Arthur Smithies at his new address in Edinburgh. We exchanged letters periodically during my ten years in  New Zealand but, to my regret, never managed to meet.

My  impressions of Arthur Smithies’ Odyssey during these years were,  in consequence,  based entirely on his letters and postcards. Unlike mine,  which provided  an  outline of my life and career, his communiqués  told  me  little about  himself. Usually he started by commenting on the latest offprint of  an article  I had sent him or expressed his thanks for  the copy of a  new  book. Frequently, he included an appendix with comments and notes and, occasionally, incorporated  observations respecting banking practice.

He also used to  refer to interesting auctions or exhibitions he had attended or to his main news as, for  instance,  that  he had completed his assignment  in  Edinburgh  and  was pleased to be back in London. But, even on this specific occasion, he did  not furnish  any  details  respecting the work he had carried out.  

Shortly  after  his return to London, he wrote that he  had  moved  from Mayfair  to Epping, where he had found a house suitable for his  ever  growing collection of furniture and artefacts. A few months later, I was delighted  to read that he had been constituted the Chairman of the Board of Directors of  a major  public  corporation.  He savoured the prestige involved  but,  all  the same, regretted that the new position did not engender the process of decision making to which he had been accustomed at Crawford & Co. “Occasionally,” he wrote  “I  miss  the hurly-burly.”

Later still –  a few weeks  after  we  had missed  one  another in 1974 –   he told me he had resigned his  appointment  in that  public  corporation and set himself up as an  arbitrator  in  commercial disputes.  A passage in the relevant letter was revealing. “My room in my  old chambers in the Middle Temple has once again become my headquarters. I am glad I  have  kept  it all these years.”   After a further few years,  when  I  was already  back in Singapore, he told me had decided to retire,  explaining:  “A sensible boxer knows when to quit the ring.”



As my mind skimmed through the letters we had exchanged over the years, it  dawned  on  me that, in more than one way, they  had  remained  formal.  I continued to address him as “Dear Mr Smithies” (or ‘Sir Arthur’) whilst his letters opened  with “My Dear Berger”. Neither of us had ever referred in our correspondence to the mishaps,  to  the disappointments and to the occasional upheavals  that  close friends  discuss with one another. He had, for instance, not referred  to  his split  with  the  rest of his family. I, in turn, had  never  adverted  to  my matrimonial problems.

We  had  also  been  careful in  commenting  on  each  other’s personal  decisions. I recalled that, when I advised him of my appointment  to the  Chair  in Wellington, he had observed: “I only hope you will be  able  to pursue  your  interest in porcelain from out there.”  Notably, the  very  same letter  included  one  of  the only two comments he had  ever  made  about  my personal  life.  “From all I hear,” he had written, “Wellington is a  nice place;  hopefully  your  wife,  who is accustomed to life  in  a  hustling  and bustling  town  like Singapore, will find it congenial.”  The  other  comment, written  when I told him I had been appointed to a Chair at Monash  University in  Melbourne, went in the same direction: “I am sure you will find  a  larger University a new challenge. Your wife, I trust, is looking forward to life  in a  large  town  like Melbourne.” He had been less direct when I  told  him,  a few years later, that we had decided to return  to  Singapore.  Having expressed  his warm congratulations on my new appointment, he added:  “So  you have decided to settle in your wife’s old home town”.   



As Yuan Ming kept discussing her forthcoming deal with the overseas parties, I continued to reflect on my  correspondence  with  Arthur Smithies. Then, just as she ended the call,  the waiter placed the meal I had ordered in front of us. They chef had taken his time but, then, the dishes were freshly cooked.

“And you were thinking of Arthur Smithies whilst poor me was busy  negotiating the grand deal,” she said with a twinkle in her eye.

“I have indeed; and I like your sketch.”

“Thanks;  but  you better snap back into the present; or I’ll gobble  up   all the food: I’m as hungry as a horse!”

"As a mare, surely?"

“Sure, Uncle, sure,” she burst out laughing; “when you get fed up with the law,  you  may  devote yourself to teaching bright school children the  sequence  of tenses, the declination of verbs and ancient  grammar.”

“All right,” I replied. “And so your deal is all settled?”

“We’ll  see;  I’ll know for sure tomorrow. And I may not have to go  to  China after  all. They’ve sent some pieces over here and I’m going to  examine  them tomorrow  morning. If they are O.K., I can clinch the deal   from  London and make the final arrangements from Hong Kong.”

### 9. A Grand Deal

Next  morning I  took the underground to Bank  Station. When I  embarked  at the Lombard Street exit, I was  overcome by an urge to walk over to Birchin Lane. A  glance at the front of the well known building revealed that  it  had changed hands again. It now housed the Administration and Finance Section of a major British bank. I was about to turn back on my heels, when I heard a voice addressing me: “Can I help you, Sir?”

He, too, had aged. Streaks of salt and pepper interlaced his  previously light  hair and his face was wrinkled all over.  But his ruddy appearance  and his army bearing continued to give him an aura of robustness.

“It is a long time since you called last, Sir.”

“Some twenty  years or so. And how have you been keeping?”

“Can’t complain, Sir, can’t complain; and how are you? You look well, if I may say so.”

“Thank you” I said. “And I see the old building has new owners.”

“They  bought it some five years ago. It became too small for First  National.”

“The premises are no longer sort of open to customers.”

“No, they aren’t; but would you like to have a look?”



As I followed him, I noticed that his right knee was stiff. Despite  his effort to hide his impediment, he was limping.

“A  touch  of the gout,” he said without bitterness. “Knee is  painful  in  the morning but gets better later in the day.”

“Are you undergoing treatment?”

“Not  really;  it’ll come right sooner or later,” he answered as he let me in.



The  well  was gone. So was the elegant mezzanine floor. Rows  of  small cubby box offices, set apart by thin partitions, occupied what had once been a spacious interior. Even the staircase looked narrower and the modernised lifts lacked in charm.

“I think I have seen enough. But tell me, the old board room  –  is it still the same?”

“The room is still there; but I am afraid the panelling is gone. The polishing  process  became  too expensive, what with the cost  of  flying  the workmen over from Italy. So First National had it stripped  off. The new  pine panelling looks just as good but doesn’t have the cool touch.”

“What  a  pity” I said as he closed the door behind us. “And tell  me,  is  Mr Brian Davies around?”

“I am afraid not, Sir. He left First National years ago. I hear he went out  to the  Gulf to set up their banking system. But he may be back in  England  now. And  Sir  Arthur Smithies passed away last month. The poor gentleman. He made sure First National did the right thing by us.”

“I  was  sorry to hear of his demise. Actually, I went to the preview  of  his estate earlier this week.”

“I am going next week, Sir. I hope to get the painting of the galleon battling the storm off Yarmouth I like this painting. It used to hang in the Partners Room. It sort of reminded me of home.”

“I  think it’s there. So are you from Yarmouth?” I told him.

“We are; and  my wife is looking forward to  going back when I finish here.”

“All  the best luck in the world to you then” I said, touched by his  show  of loyalty to his home town. “And take care of yourself ...”

“ … Bates” he interceded with a grin. “Roger Bates.”



When I got to Bill Rigg’s office, I discovered that the trial had  been postponed because the judge had come down with a bout of ‘flu. To avoid a series of delays a new date had been set some two weeks after the vacated day. Shrugging my shoulders, I took a taxi to Chelsea.



As soon as I entered the flat, Yuan Ming showed me a few ceramics pieces, mainly T’ang and Song. The purchasers had demanded a second opinion. She wanted me to examine the ones in front of us. On this occasions, my work with her late father stood me in good stead. Following a careful perusal, I concluded they were genuine.



“These pieces are perfect: best T’ang and Song items I’ve seen for years” I told her.

“They are,” she agreed. “Once they are out of China, they’ll fetch a fortune.”



For  a while, I kept staring at her. Strange thoughts raced  through  my mind. Why was she implicated in such a shady deal, involving the smuggling  of a national treasure out  its home country?

“You wonder why I’m doing it?”

“Well,  yes.  Shouldn’t  this find remain in China, as part  of  the  national heritage? You are not doing it just for the money, Yuan Ming?”

“No, of course, not. I have enough;  not that my 3 per cent  cut is  to  be  sneezed  at. But, no, money is sure not my  motive.  Like  the  two principals, I want to help get these pieces to a safe place, where there are no political lunatics  who  destroy works  of art out of ideological zeal. That, Uncle, is the main  motive. When  the  dust has settled, the treasure  will be bequeathed  to  a  suitable museum. ”

“I understand,” I assured her. “But I hope you can clinch the deal from here:  if you get caught in something like this in China, I’ll never see you again.”

“Some of the people involved are right at the top; so the risk is  negligible” she  said with a smile. “But you are right – it’s dangerous because  they  may look for a scapegoat if somebody blows the whistle. So I better try to  settle it now.”



I  sat beside her as she made her call to the United States.  This  time she  spoke in Hokkien and so I could grasp occasional phrases. Outwardly,  she remained  calm  and her voice kept its even resonance. But I could  sense  the tension  that was mounting inside her. As soon as she finished, she smiled  at me apologetically and dialled a number in Hong Kong.

“And so you clinched the deal?” I asked when she ended the call with a satisfied grin.

“I have. But I had to reduce my  commission to 2 per cent.”

“But you don’t have to travel to China?!”

“No,  I  don’t! And, Uncle, you can keep the pieces we examined.  They  are  a bonus – for a long suffering uncle.”

“They are worth at least £10,000.00; perhaps more!”

“But  you are not going to sell them, are you? I’m sure you’ll place  them  on the shelves of Dad’s cabinets.” She was referring to the ceramics collection, including Tay’s pieces, which we kept in the flat in Katong.

“True” I said.  “He would have liked them! Also, such works of art should  not be sold to a rich ignoramus, who might smash them in a fit of rage when his next currency speculation misfires or when his latest mistress elopes with his chauffeur!”

“What language” she laughed. “The way you  talk, Uncle, I might forget you are a sedate lawyer  charging  resolutely for every minute of your precious  time!”

“It all goes for a good cause,” I protested.

“Like buying extravagant gifts for your niece?”

“Coming  to think of that,” I told her, “I might as well show you what  I  have bought for your birthday. I’d rather give it to you now than in six days.”

“Don’t tell me it’s another piece of jewellery!”

“No, it isn’t: just you have a look!”



An animated expression crept over her face when she picked up the Harlequin. He was gracefully dancing away from the small scent  bottle, shaped as the trunk of an oak, against which he had been leaning. Like me, she was captivated by the dynamic movement of his right arm and his left leg,   by his  beckoning hand which invited an unseen Columbine to join him  and by  his enigmatic  smile.  Although he was less than two inches tall, he had  all  the attributes of a rococo sculpture.

“He is adorable” she said after a pause. “And I love his costume. Yes, Uncle, he’s cute: I’d like to dance with him!”

“Do you like him better than the Chinese pieces you just gave me?”

“Yes,  I  do”  she said readily; “the porcelain is almost  as  good as Chinese porcelain;  and  the colours are just as fresh and project the same harmony...”

“Why, then, do you prefer him?”

“Because  he is a real man – with his own dreams. He talks to me and, yes,  I should  like to dance with him. Thanks Uncle.” Placing him caressingly beside the larger,  imposing yet perfect Chinese pieces, she concluded: “Look, Uncle,  he  dwarves these pieces.”

“They have their own elegance” I said with unease, thinking of her father.

“They  do;  but my Harlequin is  the  real  thing.”  Looking  at  me searchingly, she added: “Dad, too, knew it; but was loath to admit it.”



It was raining hard that evening. So we ordered a pizza and prepared a few dishes. I proved my ability as a chef by baking a soufflé. Over this dinner  we  planned our next day trip to Woodstock and a journey  to  the Continent.  After we had washed and dried the dishes, Yuan Ming brought up an old subject:

“Uncle,   when you first came to Dad’s shop in Chinatown,  you didn’t  even  look for it? You just stepped  in  on the spur of the moment?”

“You could say that; but I liked the tastefully arranged show window.”

“Suppose you had walked bye with your  head in the clouds; or suppose you hadn’t lost your way at all that day?”

“Well?” said I.

“We might have never met. What do you think would my life have been like, Uncle? Do you think I would have become an artist?”

“And why not? You had the talent all along.”

“But what were Dad’s plans for me?”

“He  wanted  you  to become a scholar like himself.” 

“But was I born to be a  scholar? Did I have the desire to search for knowledge?”

“Perhaps not; but your Dad tried to get you there.”

“But  can  you change  a  child’s  orientation altogether? Come, come, Uncle ,  you spent hours teaching ‘her’ to write ...”

“And you always got the top marks in school for your essays!”

“Because ‘she’  wrote them under your vigilant eye. But did  she have  a natural gift?”

“Perhaps  not. Still, under your Dad’s guidance you became  skilled in writing Chinese!”

“Because  I loved the beauty of the script. So I worked hard to  perfect my technique; and Dad was proud of me: sometime he couldn’t resist bragging. But  he  knew I  was  no scholar.”

“Still,  you  could have become a great traditional Chinese  artist?  Even  as things stand, you have been recognised by some of the best masters of China!”

“So  I have – but my work would have been sterile. Yet another Chinese  artist labouring  for years to perfect her stroke; and could I have produced  ‘Dawn’  or ‘Ablaze at Noon’.”

“You would not have conceived the idea; I’m not sure why.”

“I’ll  tell  you  why,  Uncle. Someone had to draw me  away  from  the  narrow constraints  of my own culture and early upbringing. ‘She’  needed somebody to  assure her that she had the right to  think for herself; and so you stepped into  our  shop; and helped ‘her’ to open her eyes!”

“But your Dad was as much of an individualist as me. He,  too, made a fetish of your independence.”

“He did, Uncle; and he was an individualist. Still,  he was plagued by a desperate need to cling to the image of  a traditional  Chinese scholar: detached from life, patient even if open  eyed, and  imperturbable.”

“And when he delivered his sparkling lectures in English?”

“For  these he turned himself into his image of a Cambridge scholar,  changing his  clothes, his manner of speech and even his demeanour. But here,  too,  he clung to an ideal.”

“What are you telling me, Yuan Ming?” I asked bewildered.

“In  his heart of heArt Dad remained a traditional Chinese. As you  know,  he understood  the  West and its ideals. He liked much of what the  West  offered him. But his core remained untouched.”

“And you, Yuan Ming – aren’t you still a Chinese girl?”

“In appearance only.  But when all is said and done,  Uncle, I am a bit like you. You,  Uncle,  are  no  longer  a  real  Viennese  or  Israeli.  Today,   you  think, speak and  write in English – not in one of your two mother tongues. So you’ve become a cross cultural person ...”

“A mongrel?”

“ ... quite. But remember, thoroughbreds are dull; mongrels are cute.”

“And you, Yuan Ming, what are you?”

“In many ways, I’m still  Chinese. But like you, I have travelled far away from home.”

“But how – in which direction?”

“I  went  for  a search  for myself: a search for individuality. This, Uncle, is the fetish  of the West: the ideal which separates West from East. Even if Dad had conceived the  idea  of  ‘Dawn’, the topic  would have disturbed him. In his eyes,  it would be  untraditional and vulgar.”

“He never tried to stop you,” I protested lamely.

“True;  he  didn’t.  He was a fair minded man. Perhaps he also realised that the old order had to give way.  But he didn’t approve. No, Uncle,  you had to bring out ‘her’ talents.”



Once  again,  there  was a lull in our conversation.  Both  of  us  were recalling  the  old  days  affectionately.  They had  been   happy. Seen through a kaleidoscope, the bright colours had moved into the centre. 



After a short lull, Yuan Ming resumed her discourse: “Let  me tell you, Uncle, what my life would have been like if we hadn’t  met. No doubt, ‘she’ would have taken over Dad’s shop ...”

“ ... you did in any event.”

“So I did,”  she agreed, “and ‘she’ would have made just as good a job  of  it even  if  you  hadn’t stepped into her life. ‘She’ had  the  ability  and  the business  acumen. The shop would have become her career. ‘She’ would not  have become a scholar: ‘she’ was too pragmatic. So your  grown up  Yuan  Ming  would  have  ended  up as  one  of  the  leading  Chinese  art dealers ...”

“ ... you are now!” I interceded firmly.

“Now  I’m one of the top twenty or so; if ‘she’ had grown up without   meeting you, the sky would have been the limit! I could have been in the top three!”

“Do you have regrets?”

“Of course not. You see, ‘her’ dreams would have been quenched at source and I should  have  missed  out  on my real vocation. Also,  I  should  probably  be unhappily  married  to  a successful Chinese businessman,  with  a  degree  in  ‘systems  engineering’  or some such other  frightful  subject.” Pausing  for  a minute, she went on: “And if I had come  across  my Dancing  Harlequin, I should have thought he was cute;  but the wish to dance with him would have never  crossed my mind.”



Back in my lonely hotel room, I kept thinking of  what Yuan Ming  had told me. Initially, I was disturbed by her harsh judgment of her  late father. Then, as I meandered through my own experiences  with him, I realised  she had  hit  the  nail  on its head. In many ways,  Tay’s   outlook  had resembled  Arthur Smithies’. True, there were marked differences  between  the roads chosen by the two men. Tay Fang-Shou had devoted his life to the study  of plastic  art whilst Arthur Smithies had pursued a career in the  City.   Both,  though, had an aesthetic drive and an admiration for creativity. They had also possessed the instincts of  connoisseurs and patron of the Art. These qualities enabled the two men  to recognise the merits of alien cultures.   At the  same  time, each of them had remained engrossed in  his  own  milieu.



Naturally, I  was  aware of the demarcation between  Tay  and  my  nephews  and  nieces in Singapore. It was the same gap that  separated  Arthur Smithies from Roger Bates, the ageing porter at the building in Birchin Lane.  Unlike Arthur  Smithies, Roger Bates did not  doubt  the precepts  and the norms of  his strong English background.  What would Roger Bate have told his pals in the pub after a visit to  Paris or to Vienna? Undoubtedly, he would have described each town as quaint; and he would have had much to say about  the  food, the  taverns and the attractive girls. His main sentiment, though, would  have been: “it’s good to be back at home, where everything is just right”.



Tay  and Arthur Smithies were as far removed from Roger Bates and from my tunnel-visioned  nephews and nieces as  Yuan Ming and I were ahead of the  two of  them.  Unlike  Tay and Arthur Smithies, Yuan Ming and I were  prepared  to question the very ethos of our own  respective  backgrounds and  cultures.  To us, both the idols of the home and the  platitudes  of  the market place had lost their authority. Brian Davies, I reflected, might have travelled  in the same direction but, in the event, did not take the cosmopolitan ticket.

“Yes,  Yuan Ming,” I whispered although I knew my thoughts could not be transmitted to her flat in Chelsea,  “eons ago  our paths had crossed  due  to Fortuna’s whim.  But that chance meeting had its own lasting effect on both of us.”

### 10. Last meeting with a friend

We  made our way to Woodstock in a rented car. Firm in her  belief  that wealth  ought to be enjoyed, Yuan Ming hired a Rover.  As always, she  handled the car far more confidently and aggressively than myself. Frequently she took advantage of the chivalry displayed by male drivers on the road,  remunerating their gallantry with an appreciative smile.



For  a  while  I continued to admire the progress  made  by  her.  Then, compulsively,  my mind strayed back to Arthur Smithies. Although  Yuan  Ming’s sketch  and searching assessment of his personality  had revealed  the   dents in  his  armour,  I  continued  to recall him  with  my  usual  affection  and gratitude.  As  Yuan Ming entered the M4, adroitly overtaking in  the  process another  woman driver who screamed an obscenity at her, my mind focused on  my very last meeting with my late friend: our conversation in the Athenaeum  in 1981.



It  had taken place during a week which I spent in London in respect  of my first engagement as an expert witness.  After my spell in the witness  box, our  QC  invited me, together with a colleague from King's  College,  to  have lunch  in  the Athenaeum. Looking around me when the waiter  served  the  main course, my glance rested for a moment on an elderly gentleman who was  sitting on  his  own at a nearby table. By sheer coincidence he raised his  head.  Our eyes met and, instantaneously, I recognised him.



His hair had gone grey and he had lost some weight; but he did not  look  as  frail as in Yuan Ming’s sketch. I sensed that he had  retained  his presence and had aged with dignity. Offering my excuses to my host, I  stepped over and joined Arthur Smithies.

“It has been a long time since we last met, Mr Smithies”.

“Too long, Berger, far too long.”

“And how are you keeping? You look well, if I may say so.”

“Thank you; I do look after myself; except that  I take on more cases than I ought to.”

“Surely, you do continue to enjoy your role in the City?”

“I suppose I do; it’s the life to which I’m accustomed;  occasionally, though, I  feel the need to have more time for myself: for my collection mainly.  But, tell  me, Berger, how are you getting on? And thanks again for the  books  and offprints you send me from time to time. I enjoy reading them.”

“Thanks” I said, touched “and, actually, I’m fine. As I mentioned to you in my  last  letter, I’m spending one year of sabbatical leave in  Singapore.  My wife loves it.”

“And has  she accompanied you to London?”

“I’m  afraid not. I’ve come out for just a few days – to give evidence  as  an expert  witness on banking practice.”

“And how is it going?”

“No too badly.”

“I’m glad it’s going smoothly,” he said with approbation.  “I told them you were the right man for the job when the subject cropped up in a recent conversation.”

“I’ve  wondered  who  had mentioned my name to Paine and  Pine,  Mr  Smithies. It was most kind of you to think of me.”

“Oh,  I  just  mentioned  your name; I’m sure they decided  to  call  you   in reliance on your publications.”

“But  I’m sure your support was essential, and thanks again. But  please  tell me, Mr Smithies, how do you find Epping? Do you commute to London every day?”

“Not really, just about two or three times a week. When we have an arbitration going,  I  stay in the club. And, yes, I do like Epping. A small town  with  a life of its own but with easy access to the City.”

“And how is your collection?”

“It has grown,” he responded with a smile. “I find good furniture and pieces of  porcelain  irresistible. Soon my house will become too  small  to  contain them.  The rooms begin to look cluttered. And  how is your  collection?”

“Getting quite substantial!” I told him proudly.

“Which shows that both of us  are hooked on collecting,” he said.  Then, as  if  embarrassed by his joke, he added in haste: “And have a look,  I  just received  a catalogue of a forthcoming sale of the estate of a keen  collector from Torquay.”

Opening  the catalogue at the pages displaying the porcelain  items,  he drew my attention to the yellow milk jug.

“Isn’t it lovely?” he asked.

“Exquisite,” I confirmed. “You’ll bid for it, no doubt?”

“There are a few other good pieces in the sale; but I think this  is the  best. Have a look for yourself.”

For  a  few  moments both of us were engrossed  in  the  Meissen  pieces displayed in the catalogue. He was  about  to make a remark about  a lovely vase, but changed his  mind  and said:  “But I think you better rejoin your table; Bailey has just  glanced  in our direction.”

“Oh,  I suppose they are really discussing some other forthcoming case,”  then, realising  that  our conversation had gone on for quite a  while,  I  conceded resignedly, “but you are, of course, right. Still, I am delighted we have,  at long last, met again.”

Getting  ready  to rise and take my leave, I   was overcome by profound sense of gratitude. Settling back into my chair and trying hard to control my voice,  I turned  back to him: “But before we part, Mr Smithies, there is just one  more thing I have got to say to you.  I do want to thank you for all you have  done for  me and for all your concern and assistance over the years. In  more  than one manner, you have set me on my way. I am – and will always  remain – deeply grateful to you.”

Even  as I spoke, I experienced  a sense unease. I  had  used the  words of a  young man  at the outset of his career expressing his  thanks to  his  teacher.  Coming from myself, an academic in mid life  with  a  sound track record, they sounded out of place. Had I made a fool of myself? My fears were  allayed by the change in Arthur Smithies’ expression. It told me  I  had not  spoken in vain and that my outburst had fallen on receptive ears. He  had understood  what I meant and was moved. For a few moments  he  remained  lost for words. Then, in his usual, even, voice, he replied:

“I  think  you give me too much credit, Berger. There were,  of  course,  your supervisors  in  Oxford  and  don’t  you  underrate  your  research   and perseverance.  But I do appreciate what you have just said; and believe me  it has always been a pleasure.”

He  was about to add a few words in the same vein  but, after a  hurried glimpse  at the other table, cut himself short: “Once again, thanks  for  what you  have just told me. But I really think you ought to return to your  table. Otherwise, old Bailey might conclude I’ve kidnapped his guest.”

Having rejoined my host, I used a lull in the conversation to glance  in Arthur Smithies’ direction. Outwardly, he appeared immersed in his  catalogue; but  a  satisfied expression brightened his face. Shortly thereafter,  when  I looked   over  again,  his  table  was  vacant;  Arthur  Smithies   had   left unobtrusively.

### 11. Re-estimate

“You  have been in a far away country, Uncle,” said Yuan Ming as I turned  back to her. “Do you always neglect your lady friends when they act as chauffeurs?”

“Sorry,” I said contritely, “just for a moment I was thinking of ...”

“Arthur Smithies” she broke in “your last encounter with him, ‘me think’!”

“Spot on. But how did you know?”

“I know you. And that encounter, Uncle, it took place shortly before you found Dad and me?”

“So  it  did.  I stumbled into your shop some ten days after I  had returned to Singapore.”

“Yes,  Uncle; and you told me about that episode  two or three days before  we drew ‘Dawn’; it was interesting to listen to you: it confirmed that you hadn’t changed at all; just as I thought.”

“What do you mean?”

“You, Uncle, have always been constant in your affiliations; once you accepted a person, he could do no wrong.”

“You are probably right” I acknowledged.

“I believe I am; but there is something I’ve never fully understood. You see,  you have always been grateful to your two supervisors  and  also  to those  of your Deans who helped you on your way. But, somehow, you  felt  much more  deeply indebted to Arthur Smithies. It was the type of relationship  you had with Dad. I think I know the reason, but why don’t you tell me.”

“All right,” I nodded. “You see, my two supervisors and my Deans belong to  one and the same world: to the Universities. Academia is an open ended society, in which  able students can race ahead regardless of their background or  station in  life. I have benefited greatly from my two years in Oxford, have  remained grateful to those who gave me their support and, in turn, have endeavoured  to render  the  same  assistance  to my own gifted students  and  also  to  young colleagues. As you know, I’m proud of those who are presently overtaking me in my own field.”

“And Arthur Smithies?” she asked.

“He  represented a different world. The aristocratic English banks are  closed shops,  opening  their  ranks  mainly  to  young  Englishmen  from  the  right professional  background.  It  helps if an applicant  has  a  good  University degree; but the pedigree is just as important.”

“And  you were flattered by the interest which a member of this class  showed in your work and by his offer to appoint you to his staff?”

“Yes,  Yuan Ming;  but it wasn’t just the assistance which he gave me and  the offer. It went much deeper than that. You see, I had, really, no right to make any  demands  on  him  or on his bank. There was  no  social  or  professional norm  that  required  him to be at my service. I  was  touched  by  his generosity.”

“It boosted your confidence as well, didn’t it?” she probed.

“It did indeed. It was good to know that my work was well thought of by one of London’s leading bankers, just as it was good to know later on, in  Singapore, that  your  Dad  approved of my progress in the  study  of  Chinese porcelain. And, Yuan Ming, he too encouraged me out of sheer kindness.”

“And  because  he  liked  you; which – I’m certain – also  motivated  Arthur Smithies. But then, Uncle, why did you look so sad just now: not just sad but deflated.”

“It’s the cup and saucer which I gave him. I still can’t understand why  they have  vanished  without  a trace. Also, he told you ‘Dawn’  graced  his sitting room; so why is it displayed on that ridiculous wall?”

“I see; but, remember, he wrote that letter to me when he was still living  in Epping;  and, oddly enough,  the house in Woodstock doesn’t appear to  have  a proper sitting room. Judging from the catalogue, there is a library, a smoking room, a spacious lounge, a dining room, a King Arthur bedroom and bathroom and so on; but there is no sitting room!”

“True,” I said; “but, of course, he could have hung ‘Dawn’ on the main wall of any one of the living rooms!”

“So  he  could,” she countered; “but don’t you think that a man, who  likes  to relax  in  a  comfy sitting room,  would arranges to have such a  place  when  he renovates his new house?”

“It didn’t occur to me,” I said bewildered; “still, I roamed about in  the rooms and none answers the description. So what is your explanation?”

“I haven’t got one at present,” she smiled at me; “but I won’t be surprised  if we find a simple answer to our big questions when we have had a closer look at the house.”



When  we  alighted  from the shuttle bus, which  conveyed  us  from  the car park to the house, Yuan Ming pulled my arm gently.

“Let  the  others go in first, Uncle. The pieces won’t run away. I’d  like  to have a good look at the grounds.”



The  shrubs  of the garden at the back of the house had  been  carefully trimmed  and  the lawns neatly mowed. The beds of flowers had been meticulously  weeded. Yuan Ming’s eyes savoured them. Her glance, though, kept sweeping back to the house. When we had completed our round, she turned to me: “Well, what do you think of the house? It’s quite big?”

“Isn't it?”

“And how many rooms of it have you seen?”

“Seven or eight – on the first and second floors.”

“But there are three stories?”

“I assumed the remaining rooms were the servants’ quarters.”

“But how many rooms are there altogether?”

“Twenty  or  so, I suspect. Actually, I only saw the rooms  facing  the  front garden. We had no access to the other rooms.”

“They can’t all be servants’ quarters! Let’s try to find out what is in them” she suggested, leading the way to  the main entrance.



A Christie’s employee, identified by his tag as Alan Jones, came over to meet us shortly after we had entered the house. He had noticed my reaction when I had seen ‘Dawn’ on the wall near the entrance to the hall. Concerned about my patent displeasure, he had asked a specialist from their Chinese art department to have a look. Based on his assessment they had revised their assessment.

“The artist’s  full name, I gather, is Cheng Yuan Ming” he told us.

‘Cheng’  was the Mandarin  pronunciation  of  Yuan  Ming’s surname.  Like her father before her, she used the Hokkien version – Tay – in her everyday life but transliterated the character as ‘Cheng’ when signing her  works.  Confident that Alan Jones was unaware of the peculiarities of  Chinese writing, I told him: “I see; actually,  Miss  Tay  is from Los Angeles;  and  she  knows  the artist.”

“Do you know her well?” asked Alan Jones.

“Rather,” said Yuan Ming, unperturbed, “I don’t always approve of her work, though.”

“Let me then show you the one we have,” he volunteered, adding for my benefit “we have found a more prominent place for it.”



‘Dawn’  was now displayed on the main wall of the library. For a  few minutes  the  three of us concentrated on it. I could feel  Yuan  Ming’s  hand clutching mine.

“And do you approve of this piece?” asked Alan Jones.

“I’ve got to agree with Uncle; I think it’s OK,” she conceded.

“You  may have some firm competition when you bid for it,” Alan Jones  said  to me.  “We  have sent details of it to a number of American  dealers  and  three  have cabled for photographs.”

“So  you won’t have a chance for a steal, Uncle; what a pity” said  Yuan  Ming sweetly.

“Oh, I don’t mind that: this painting deserves to go to the highest  bidder.” 

“Quite  so” said Alan Jones, whose eyes had  moved surreptitiously  from  Yuan Ming  to  me and back to her. “Well, and can I show you any other  item,  Miss Tay?”

“Uncle tells me there is a nice oil by Tissot.”

“Let me show it to you,” he said approvingly.



Alan Jones took us for a tour of the European paintings. When he was done, Yuan Ming   observed: “The late Sir Arthur must have been a man  of  taste and  Uncle tells me he was also a discriminating collector. Why then all  this cluttering? These rooms look like art galleries!”

“The  paintings were not displayed simultaneously,” he explained readily.  “The bulk   was  kept  in one room. I  gather  Sir  Arthur rotated  them periodically on the walls of the living areas.” Turning to me he added: “And so  you  knew   the  late Sir Arthur? And have you have  been  to  this  house before?”

“I  knew him when he was the Managing Partner of Crawfords,” I  confirmed.  “He was a fine banker. But I have not visited him here in Woodstock.”

“Unfortunately,  he did not complete  the renovation of the house”  advised  Alan Jones.

“It is a rather large house,” interceded Yuan Ming.

“It is indeed; and in an excellent location.”

“I agree,” she said. “And may I ask: what is going to happen to it?”

“The executors have asked us to  auction it.”

“I wonder if Uncle and I could see the remaining rooms; we have been searching for a house in the Oxford area for some time.”



Alan  Jones' expression did not change: his face displayed no  surprise. He was, patently, far more sophisticated than I had thought.

“I'm afraid the rest of the house has been sealed off for the time being.  But I  can arrange for a viewing some time next week. We should have appointed  an agent by then.”

“We travel to the Continent tomorrow,” she answered. “But we’ll be back for the auction.”

“Then  I’ll  try to arrange something for that day – after the  auction.  But, you know, this is  a  rather  big  house: probably too  big  for a holiday home.  Would you like me to ask the agent to show you some other  properties as well?”

“That would be splendid” she agreed readily.



After  a perusal of the porcelain pieces, Yuan Ming and I made  our  way back  to  the  shuttle  bus. Soon we were again in  the  car park.  As soon as we were on the way, Yuan Ming turned back to our search.

“Did you have a good look at the frames of the paintings?”

“Can’t say I did; why?”

“The  pressure  marks  suggest that they were placed  on  the  floor,  leaning against  each  other.  So Arthur Smithies did rotate  the  mainstream  of  his paintings: but not ‘Dawn’.”

“How do you know? Because there are no pressure marks on its frame?”

“That’s  one reason; and did you notice the stains along the left side of  the frame?”

“I didn’t; I simply couldn’t take my eyes off the drawing itself.”

“I know; your friend Alan Jones noticed it too; he gave you a perplexed look!”

“Oh well; but what is the significance of these stains on the frame?”

“ ‘Dawn’  had  not been placed on the floor, Uncle. The stains were  caused  by dampness. So ‘Dawn’ was hanging on a wall with damp spots. There are no signs of dampness in any of the rooms we have seen!”

“So  ‘Dawn’  was displayed on a wall in a room of the sealed off part  of  the house?”

“Yes, Uncle; and I wonder what else we’ll find there when we get in.”
