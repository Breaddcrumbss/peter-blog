### 12. ‘Her Loreley’

A  classy BMW, booked by Yuan Ming in London, was waiting for us on  our arrival  in Cologne airport.  I was relieved when one of the firm’s  employees offered to drive us through the hectic traffic of the town to the shore of the Rhine.  A tour of the dome was complemented by our lengthy visit to  the nearby  Germanic  museum, a modern structure encapsulating  a  Roman mosaic. It was  laid bare in the bombing attacks of 1944 after being hidden under  the ground for over a thousand years.  

Early  in the afternoon, we started our trip up the Rhine.  At dusk  we took a two bedroom suite in a  hotel in  Bacharach, a  popular  resort marked by its narrow cobble stoned streets, by its medieval fortifications and by the traditional German master-builder houses with exposed gables  and beams.



Next  morning we visited Burg Rheinfels. Standing by a window in the tower, we admired the  Rhine valley. We then took the ferry to the other shore  of  the river  and drove to Kaub - where Prince Blücher’s army  crossed the  Rhine  on its way to the Battle of Waterloo.

“But is there no bridge across the Rhine?” asked Yuan Ming, viewing the  ferry with apprehension.

“We’d have to drive all the way back to Koblenz; crossing by  ferry  is faster  and perfectly safe.”



Yuan Ming looked at me with renewed anxiety when I drove the car up  the steep narrow slip road to Gutenfels Castle, where I had reserved a suite.



Yuan Ming’s expression brightened when she looked down at the Rhine from the  window of the comfortable sitting room in our suite.

“Have you stayed here before?” she wanted to know.

“No,  I haven’t. Pat refused to come with me when I drove up; she remained  in the hotel by the river. But I spent some time on my own on the terrace; and  I kept thinking of you.”

“Of me or of ‘her’”?

“I was still looking for you then; and thinking of you as you were then; but I knew you would like it up here.”

“I  do” she agreed, “it’s  the top of world. But these silly and clumsy barges on the Rhine spoil the view.”

“Try to imagine they are medieval merchantmen, flying their flag.”

“I shall; and tell me, are we near Loreley?”

“I  think it’s the third  hilltop down  the River” I said, with some uncertainty. “You know the story?”

“I do; you told it to ‘her’ –  remember? It’s an uncanny story. And I don’t know why the creatures that lured the poor sailors up in order to slay them had  to be females. They could be sexless goblins! Your Western folklore was dreamt up by a bunch of MCPs.”

“Sure;  but, then, all the minstrels and ballad singers were men; and quite  a pack of rowdies at that.”



After  dinner, Yuan Ming assembled her easel on our balcony and started to draw. The steady rhythm of her right hand told me she had planned her painting  beforehand  and was executing it with her usual confidence and  precision. She  did  not, however, display the excitement I had detected when she  had  a breakthrough  or was drawing an entirely new piece transcending  her  earlier works. When she finished, she turned me: “Come over and  have a look, Uncle.”

She had drawn an eerie replica of the castle. On a nearby spooky Loreley a flock of  goblins  was tempting  sailors,  who had jumped overboard or had fallen  off   fighting vessels, to climb up and partake in a nocturnal feast.  On the terrace of  our castle, two women, adorned in colourful medieval apparel, were  trying to warn them off.

“What do you think of it?”

“You caught the atmosphere of the place,” I assured her.

“It ain’t a breakthrough, Uncle.”

“Perhaps  not; but you have fine tuned the colours. It will be snapped  up  in your exhibition.”

“It  might,” she agreed. Having carried the easel with the still wet  drawing back  to the sitting  room, she added: “But look, Uncle, for a while I’ve been  looking for completely new ideas. As you know I tried ...”

“In the painting you haven’t completed for your forthcoming exhibition?”

“Yes, Uncle. And I destroyed it before I left LA; you guessed, didn’t you?”

“I  knew something was wrong; you see, you didn’t refer to it since  you  came over.”

“It  was  a  refinement  of  my earlier works;  I  am  looking  for  an  added dimension.”

“I believe you are getting there.”

“What makes you think so? This drawing – I’m calling it ‘Her Loreley’ – isn’t in the same class as ‘Dawn’ or ‘Ablaze at Noon”.

“True,” I conceded. “Your new piece doesn’t display the same spontaneous  outburst of  emotions  and  doesn’t  have the same  compelling  effect.  But  there  is something special about its colours; you have used them in a different manner; as if they had a message of their own.”



Nodding her head, she placed the easel in a corner. She then came over to the sofa and sat next to me.

“So you think I’m on my way?”

“I do; although I’m not certain what you are aiming at.”

“How, then, can you be optimistic?”

“Because you are searching; just as you did previously.” 

“But aren’t you swayed by your  emotions when you discuss my work.”

“I don’t think so. But why not tell me what you are looking for?”

“I  wish I knew myself; all I know is that I want to find a new  dimension.  I don’t want to use the same old style and technique for the next twenty years.”

“Then you are bound to find what you’re after; good artists always do if  they persevere; as long as they have the zest.”



After  a  good night’s rest, Yuan Ming was, again, her  exuberant  self. Sliding into the driver’s seat, she turned to me: “It’s a long way to Breisach, Uncle; so I better drive!”

For  most  of the  time,  she fell in line with the cars in the fast lane of  the  Autobahn. Occasionally,  though,  I  had to suppress  my  anxiety  when  she overtook  more leisurely moving vehicles. She, in turn, got furious when  some drivers refused to give way.

The  car continued its steady progress southward. As we  circumnavigated Mainz,  my  thoughts  strayed from the young woman, who  handled  the  car  so dexterously,  to little Yuan Ming of my youth in Singapore. She too  had  been temperamental,  gliding from one mood to another.  Occasionally,  her little  girl’s outbursts had been hard to take. Still,  she had never  angered me  and, as soon as a storm was over, I dismissed it from my mind.  My recollections  had  always focused on our delightful outings:  the  occasional trips to Kota Tinggi, the afternoons we spent together in the Chinese Swimming Club  and on the beach, her visits to my study in the  University  and the sketches she had drawn when she had been with me.

“You are thinking of ‘her’, Uncle”.

“Well, yes: you are really still the same: full of beans and good to be with.”

“And quite as likely to throw a tantrum,” she supplemented

“But you really weren’t a problem: not as far as I was concerned.”

“Not  as  far  as you were concerned!” she mimicked. “Great  wonder. ‘She’ doted on  you. So once Uncle looked at her sadly or contritely, not daring to stroke her hair for fear of a rebuff, she melted. And then ‘she’ climbed on your lap and let you pacify her, after which all was well again.”

“But you – I mean ‘she’ – always responded to reason!”



A lull in our conversation enabled me to venture, once again, back  into the past.  I kept thinking of her drawings, her first attempt to use oils  and her decision to confine herself to Chinese ink and aquarelle.  She  had  to review her decision in her adult life, when she became  a  sought after  artist  in Los Angeles; but her original decision –  at the age of eleven – had been  sound.  She had sensed that oil paints did not enable her to  execute  a perfect stroke and, in addition, had found it easier to master her colours  in the  more  liquid mediums.



As our car continued its  progress  in  the direction  of  Mannheim,  I  let  Yuan  Ming’s  early  paintings  and  drawing materialise  in front of my eyes.  Many of them were superb and each  of  them had brought me joy, even the caricatures of her Dad and of myself. Over the years, she had gone from strength to strength; but was she going to make the next leap forward?



“We have to  concentrate  on  the  road, Uncle” Yuan Ming interrupted my thoughts.  “Which route to   take  after  we  by-pass Karlsruhe?”

“The  main route to Basle; we exit the Autobahn just before Freiburg; but  you must be getting pretty tired.”

“Just a bit; and how long is it from here to Breisach?”

“At your speed, probably three hours. But it’s high time we stop for lunch.”



Yuan  Ming was considerably more tired than I had appreciated. After  a hurried  meal in the next Autobahn resort, she let me take the driver’s  seat.  As soon our BMW joined the traffic, she closed her eyes.

Yuan Ming slept soundly during the last stretch of our lengthy trip.  I, in  turn,  had to concentrate on the road, proceeding steadily on  the  middle lane  of  the Autobahn. Despite the tedious road and the abusive  gestures  of overtaking  drivers, I felt elated. Yuan Ming’s  words confirmed  that  she  was getting close to her target. She  had  been  equally restless and subject to bouts of insomnia before she had executed her  earlier major works.

Our ride got bumpy, after  I  left the Autobahn. Soon Yuan Ming opened her eyes: “Is this the Kaiserstuhl, Uncle?”

“Yap.”

“Where is the Rhine?”

“A few kilometres to the West. We’ll greet her again at Breisach.”

“It’s  lovely  here,” she said as we went through  picturesque  villages.  “The houses  are  so  cute. Not as grand as up North, but homely.



When we reached our destination, we decided to avoid the luxury hotel by the Rhine and, instead, took two rooms in a comfortable inn. Yuan Ming viewed her room, with its heavy old fashioned furniture, with glee. Stepping  out to the balcony, she announced happily:

“And, Uncle, you do get a glimpse of the Rhine from out here.”

“Splendid; and what does your young Ladyship wish to do now?”

“Your young Ladyship wants to have a shower  and  a decent rest. When do they serve dinner?”

“From about 6.30; but the restaurant remains open till 9.30.”

### 13. The Breakthrough

We had cocktails  before dinner. Relaxing  in the small bar adjacent to the dining room,  I  experiencing the  happiness and  fulfilment  which overcame me when I was with her.  It was – had always been – a Platonic friendship and bound to remain so. It was, at the same time, more constant and more deeply ingrained than a relationship cemented by a physical bond. True, ‘out of bounds’ had been defined. But the territory within the region was fertile and comforting.

“Uncle,”  she said after a while, “sometime, when we are together,  I feel sorry for your wife. You never loved her.”

“True,”  I admitted. “But I don’t think she felt much for me either. For  years she kept hankering after that Chinese chap who jilted her when she  contracted TB.”

“She might have forgotten him if you had given her a chance.”

“Possibly;  but  it  wasn’t in me; and she kept  aggravating  me  by  sticking stubbornly  to the values of her home. Up to this very day, she  has  remained closer to her brothers and sisters than to me.”

“So you miscalculated when you thought a few years in New Zealand might  bring the  two of you together?” For a moment she hesitated, but then went on:  “And you,  too, kept feeling closer to your friend Tay and to ‘her’ than to Pat. Did she know?"

“She knew I kept thinking of somebody.”

“It must have been tough on her.”



Yuan Ming had put her finger on the rot. Throughout my unhappy  marriage I managed to find outlets: a small group of bridge players in Singapore and in Wellington; a  circle of Jewish acquaintances in Melbourne and a circle of art connoisseurs after my return to Singapore. I had also joined some professional bodies. In this manner I filled in time and managed to sidestep the central problem. Pat’s affiliations centred on  her family; and her disappointment with life centred on me.



“I’m  sure  it was tough on her,” I admitted. “She could have made things easier for herself if  she  had learned to accept, or at least to understand, our Western world. But she didn’t adjust; even today she judges everything by the yardstick of her Eastern family.”

“But, then, haven’t you remained a Westerner?”

“ I have; but, in the very least, I can manage in my Eastern society, including Pat’s family.”

“But Eastern society has always been tolerant to European and other barbarians; we ‘forgive’ their ‘mistakes’.  Also, Uncle, your background made you adaptable. Your family fled   from Vienna  to  Tel-Aviv.  Much later you moved on to  Oxford,  to  Singapore,  to Wellington and eventually to Melbourne. To survive, you had to open your mind. From what you told me,  Pat’s horizon was set by her family.”

“And I was dead wrong when I thought I could change her.”

“I’m  afraid  you  were,  Uncle  Pygmalion.  If  ‘she’  had appreciated the risks involved, she would have tried to stop you; but in  many ways ‘she’ was still a child.”

“Still,” I turned to the bright side, “here we are together on the Rhine: so all is well.”

“But what will happen when you return to Singapore, Uncle?”

“We’ll  see.  At the moment Pat is in Taiwan. When I rang her before  we  left London,  she  told  me she was going to spend a month or so  with  her  church friend  in Tainan. The orphanage needed an extra pair of hands. She  asked  me not to ring her there.”

“Why don’t you send her a postcard?”

“I didn’t tell her I was going to spend some time on the Continent; I’ll  send her one when we’re back in London.”

“And buy her a nice gift; you may ward off the storm!”



We  stayed in the Kaiserstuhl for the next few days. Yuan Ming  admired the cobblestone paths, the  charming vineyards basking in the sun and the fine cellars  stocked  with large fragrant wooden barrels filled with maturing wine. She  kept drawing and sketching incessantly during our last day  in the Kaiserstuhl.



She remained as animated during our drive to Lake Constance. To avoid getting embroiled in the traffic between  Freiburg and  Basle, I took the winding roads of the Black Forest. Even as we drove, Yuan Ming kept sketching. Occasionally, she asked me to stop  for while and enjoyed the view.

“Uncle,” she said whilst we proceeded at a slow pace in  the direction  of  Schafhausen; “the Black Forest must be quite something  in  the winter, when it’s snowing.”

“It  is: the cedar trees look majestic when they’re covered in white. But  you have  to be careful. One afternoon I lost my clutch when I drove  through  the snow;  lucky for me, a truck with a kindly driver passed bye. He towed me  all the way to a garage.”

“I  can imagine how you felt,” she said, adding spontaneously; “but  look,  why don’t we stop for a while and go for a walk in the forest.”

“Good idea!”

To  her  disappointment,  we found  no strawberries. Soon, though, she spotted a squirrel climbing a  tree. Halting  on  one  of the upper branches, it brushed  its  moustache  with  its forepaws. It then waived its bushy  tail, and descended into a hole in the trunk. To my delight, Yuan  Ming  sketched it as an elf, dancing gracefully in front of a snow covered tree.

I  made another stop at Rheinfall, with the imposing waterfalls  feeding the Rhine. I could sense Yuan Ming's excitement.

“They’re  not  as imposing as the Niagara’s; but there is more life to  them, life and rhythm;  and look at the reflection of the light when the water  roars past us.”



After  lunch, we continued our  journey  along  the Swiss  shore  of  Lake Constance. Once again, Yuan Ming sketched  fervently.  She paused  for a while when we crossed the Austrian border,  but  soon resumed her work.

“So  we are in a pretty cosmopolitan part of Europe, Uncle.  We  started  near the  French border, drove through the Black Forest, continued to  Switzerland; and now we are in your home country.”

“If you want to call it that; but, yes, we are on an Alpine cross roads; and don’t forget that Liechtenstein and Italy are just around the corner.”



Later  in  the afternoon, we reached Bregenz and proceeded to  upper Lochau. A warm, appreciative, smile descended on Yuan Ming’s face  when the  maid opened the door of our suite, with its dark stained cathedral  beams and the wide sliding glass doors opening to the veranda. It deepened as she stepped out and let her eyes wander from  the attractive whitewashed farm houses, spread on the meadows down the steep hill, to the expanse of the deep blue Lake Constance right beneath us.

“So  you had your a plan all along, Uncle?”

“I  knew you would like it here,” I affirmed. “It’s the sort of place we  used to talk about long  ago ...”

“When ‘she’ was watching you with her big black eyes?”



A  splendid  Austrian dinner, preceded by a stroll through  the  compact village  square and main road, brought our wanderings for that day to their  end. The  ebullient  even if  inward looking expression that dwelt on  Yuan  Ming’s face,   made my heart leap with  joy.  It was  a  mien I had good reason to recall. Her elation deepened as  we  stepped out, once again, onto our veranda. I watched keenly as her glance fastened for a while on the lights of the small German island city of Lindau, just a short drive  away  from  us, and then travelled  further  into  the  distance,  to Friedrichshafen,  onward  to  the border city of Constance and  then  back  to Bregenz.  Suddenly, a shooting star brightened the clear night sky,  ascending proudly  above us.  For a moment it hovered over a ship sailing on  the  lake,  its  sparkle  merged with the lights of the upper deck.  It  then  descended,  appearing to fall into the lake.

“This is exciting, Uncle,” she said. “I only hope this ship isn’t another stupid barge.”

“It’s a tourist boat,” I assured her. “Tomorrow, we can take a night cruise and have dinner on board. But it’s really nicer up here.”

“I’m sure it is,” she said, adding with a smile: “and now, Uncle, it’s time for Yuan  Ming’s  beauty sleep. It’s been a splendid day; but now  it’s  time  for bed.”



A  draft  from the window, which I had left slightly ajar, woke  me  up early  next  morning. To my surprise, Yuan was not in her room.  For  a  few moments I panicked. Had it all been a  mirage?  Was  I,  in reality, back in my own barren bedroom in Singapore. Then, as the last  grains of  sleep  receded  from my eyes, reason drove me back  to  reality.  Glancing around  me, I tiptoed to the door separating the bedrooms from the small lounge.

To  my  relief,  she  was  standing by  her  easel,  looking  fresh and resolute. I  was  about  to  withdraw noiselessly to my bedroom, when –  without turning her head – she said: “No, don’t go back; come over here, Uncle.”

“How long have you been working?”

“For quite a while; I watched dawn; it was lovely.”

“Is all going well?”

“I had a good start; but I’ve come up against a snag.”

Two  discarded sheets of rice paper, lying crumbled on the  floor,  bore witness to her frustration. Trying to comfort her, I stroked her hair. After a short while, she turned to me.

“I was about to call it a day; but perhaps I’ll have another go.”

“What’s the problem? I observed how you planned it yesterday, during dinner.”

“I  did;  and  the idea is fine; it’s just one detail; I  just  can’t  get  it right.”

“Not the lighting or the colours?”

“No; of course not: they’re the mainstream ...” she was about to continue when I realised where she had gone astray.

“Don’t tell me,” I said; “it must have something to do with the image of one of us!”

“So it does, Uncle Know-All,” she said, her jest flattened by the strain in her voice “it’s ‘her’!”

“Don’t tell me you are trying to draw your - I mean ‘her’ - portrait?”

“But I am; I’m portraying ‘her’ with you. You are easy, except that I haven’t decided if I you are to look cute, funny or wistful. But” she wailed “I  can’t get ‘her’ right!”

“But,  for  heaven’s  sake, Yuan Ming,” I lost  my  cool;  “to  portray yourself as a child without even a photograph to look at – that’s a mammoth task.”

“But  it’s not as if I can’t remember ‘her’ face; I stared at it often  enough in  the  mirror.  Still;  something  about  ‘her’ countenance eludes me now.”

“Why  not  let me have a look;not at the whole  painting:  just  your – I mean ‘her’ –  portrait.”

“You know I’m not supposed to!”



She was alluding to the unwritten traditions of the X’ian  School that had elected  her  a  “Master Artist”, an honour rarely conferred  on  an  overseas Chinese.  Mystified as I had remained by the School’s  firm edict against  the showing of an incomplete work, I had paid due respect to the Code. At present, though,  we  were  facing  a crisis. I  was  still  searching  for  persuasive arguments justifying an exception, when Yuan Ming made up her mind.



“But  I suppose even these rules can be bent when needed,” she said, tearing  a small  piece off one of the discarded drawings. Noting my apprehensive  start, she told me: “Once discarded, it’s only a piece of wastepaper, Uncle.”

“Well,” she asked after I had been examining the delicate portrait for a few minutes, “where did I go wrong?”

“It’s ‘her’ alright; but, to start with, there’s something  wrong with the nose.”

“Don’t tell me ‘she’ had a snub nose; Chinese girls don’t have them.”

“No, ‘she’ didn’t have a snub nose; but it wasn’t as flat as you’ve drawn it.”

“Let’s  see how to change it,” she said, overtly encouraged. Putting her  brush aside, she sketched the face again with a light blue crayon.

“Better?” she asked.

“Just about right now; but there is also something wrong with the  cheekbones; your face was a bit more round then.”

“And how is this?” she asked after a further attempt.

“It will do” I said.

“Anything still bothering you” she asked searchingly.

“ ‘Her’ eyes.”

“Don’t tell me they were even bigger?”

“No, they weren’t; but you are portraying us together, aren’t you?”

“I am indeed!”

“You  -  I  mean ‘she’ -  used to look at me more directly!” I  said.

“Spot  on,”  I told her happily when she completed the next  sketch.  “And can I have the sketch?” 

“You’ve earned it,” she consented magnanimously; “but now I must go ahead with the final version!”

Standing  by  her side, I admired the rhythm  of her  steady movements. Occasionally, she stepped closer to the easel  or  bent slightly  forward  to dip her brush in one of the coloured ink pads.  Once  or twice  she stopped for a few seconds, changed her brush and looked  critically at  her  work. I had by then discerned that it comprised  individual  subjects rendered  in fine detail and larger abstract forms executed in deeper  colours and lose shapes.

A lull in her steady beat brought me back to the world around me.  From the corner of my eye, I saw the Dancing Harlequin, smiling at me  from the top of a nearby chest of drawers.

“Are you bringing him in?” I asked.

“Yes,  of course; right at the top; but I’m not certain in which direction  he ought to look.”

“Yours, naturally?”

“And why?”

“Because his is the spirit of creativity, of inspiration, of dreams.”

“Then he ought to look at both of us” she concluded softly.



Selecting a fine brush, she moved closer to the easel.  For once, her hand moved slowly, delicately, occasionally just allowing the  brush to touch the fine rice paper. I, in turn, was holding my breath.

“That’s  it” she said at long last; “you can breathe again normally  now and have a look.”

The large drawing – entitled “Harlequinade” – differed  from all her previous works. Scenes from our  journeys  through life,  portrayed in fine detail, were overshadowed by amorphous,  intertwined, shapes  creating  a dynamic atmosphere. What struck me most, though,  was  the innovative  application of the colours. Scenes from early years were drawn  in light,  harmonious,  shades. The waterfalls of Kota Tinggi, the beach  in  the Sisters  Island and my study in the Japanese Block of the University of Singapore were  all executed  in  this manner. She had also drawn an image of her father’s old shop.  Events from our more recent years  were enlivened in deeper and richer colours.  The drawing of ‘Dawn’ and a scene in the  new  swimming pool  were followed by highlights from our trips. The sight of a goblin  above Loreley  brought a smile to my  face.  Lower down  she  had drawn us standing together by the easel. Right  at the top, at the upper left corner, the Dancing  Harlequin  was smiling benignly.

The  magnificent  drawing was further enhanced by the  coloured  shapes, which created a sense of motion, as if the work kept rotating. In her previous works  she  had,  occasionally, achieved the same  effect  by  an interplay  of  the  shapes,  bringing  to mind the  steps  of  a  dance.  This impression  was  now deepened by the manipulations  of  the  colours, which appeared to gain a life of their own.

“I  can see and hear the colours,” I told her in an emotionally charged  voice. “It is as if you have added a tune – some music –  to the scenes. And they  are fresher and deeper than ever before.”

“So you think I have made it?”

“I do!”

For a moment she remained by the easel looking fulfilled, happy but, at the same time, exhausted. She fell asleep as soon as she got back to her bed. When she woke up – some two hours later on – she smiled at me warmly: “You must be hungry, Uncle?”

“A bit; how about you?”

“I’d  like  stay in bed a bit longer; why don’t you go down and have  your  breakfast.  You can bring me back a coffee and some rolls and jam.”



Yuan  Ming  enjoyed  the strongly brewed coffee  and  then spread  the  homemade  strawberry  jam   on  the  two  rolls.  When  she finished, I placed the tray outside the door of the suite and attached the “Do not Disturb” tag to  the handle.

“Uncle,”  she said when I stepped back into her room, “mind telling  me  again what you think of the ‘Harlequinade’?”

“It surpasses everything you have done before; it’s a masterpiece.”

“Which scene did you like best?”

“The one where we sit together in my old study, with you ...”

“You mean ‘her’ …”   she interjected.

“Very  well  then,  with  ‘her’ giving me  that  special,  wistful,  look.”

“Alright then, Uncle,” she said after a short lull; “but is it better than  all the stuff ‘she’ drew?”

“It  is;  ‘she’ could not have  conceived anything as complex and as elaborate.”

“But  how about the execution? I still want to know why you have never let  me see ‘her’ drawings and sketches. And you have quite a few, don’t you?”

“Two hundred and thirteen, to be accurate!”

“Why did you hide them from me?”

“ ‘She’ had a special trick with her colours; they were fresh and expressive. I thought it best to let you get there again without showing you ‘her’ works.”

“Am I there now?”

“You  are! Perhaps even  more so than ever before.”



She  was, again, relaxing. I was too  happy to  break  the harmony, too elated to disrupt the sense of  peace  and  bliss. I knew she had continued to draw consistently during the many years we had been out of touch. Her eyes had remained sharp and observant; her brushes had retained their dexterity; but her colours had lost their lustre. Something had been missing; but, at long last,  she had found her way back.



We  lunched on the premises. In the afternoon, we drove down to Lindau. During dinner in a  restaurant by  the boat quay, Yuan Ming suggested that,  instead  of  proceeding  to Vienna,  we  spend  the  remaining days of our trip  in  the  region.  Smiling happily, I agreed.



We stayed an extra day in Lochau and then proceeded to  Liechtenstein. We crossed  to Austrian Tyrol through the spectacular  Arlbergpass,  spending  a night  by the Italian border. From there  we drove through  the network of secondary roads to the Kizbühler Alps. As if by agreement, we  made our stops in the smaller, more secluded, resorts.



Yuan  Ming’s  enthusiasm  manifested itself again  as  she  watched  the scenery along the winding mountain road to Canazei in the heart of the Dolomites. To my delight, she took the easel out of the boot of the car. 

During our first two days in Canazei, Yuan Ming sketched frantically. On the third day she left her easel  behind.

“I need a rest, Uncle,” she said. “I’ve done more drawings on our trip than  in the previous six months. So it’s right to  leave the easel and sketchbook behind.”



It  was during that last day, on our way back from our  afternoon  walk, that Yuan Ming came up with a question that had crossed my own mind from  time to  time. We had just finished a steep descent through a forest path and  were resting on a tree trunk.

“Uncle,” she said, “we’ve been to some of the cutest spots in Europe.”

“We have indeed,” I agreed.

“The scenery is lovely and each place has an atmosphere of its own.”

“It has; but what are you driving at, Yuan Ming?”

“Tell  me, Uncle, how many famous artists lived and created in  these  places; how many composers and how many novelists and poets?”

“The  only  artist I can think of is that Egger-Lienz fellow;  but  he  wasn’t really top class; and I  can’t think of any composers or novelists.”

“I suppose the really talented ones went to the bigger centres? I suspect that the big  cities  had their  magnetic effect,  the limelight, the action; and the  nobility  offered its patronage to penniless young artists and musicians.”

“The  nobility  and later on the wealthy bourgeoisie,” I corrected.  “Any  other reasons?”

“And  those who weren’t ambitious remained behind and ended  up like our Egger-Lienz.”

“Quite,” I agreed, “and, of course, they failed to develop. An artist needs  to understudy his master; he needs to slave in a studio; and a musician has to be trained.  He  usually  learns  from his maestro and from  the  response  of  a sophisticated audience.”

“How about novelists?”

“They’re  different:  a talented writer can develop from  reading  alone.  He needn’t  be  attached, or have direct access, to a literary circle.  Think  of Jane  Austin,  the Brontés and, possibly, Herman Hesse. They made it mainly  because they had the gift, the perseverance and - Yuan Ming - luck.”

“Luck?” she burst out laughing. “You are again on your hobby horse, Uncle.”

“Guilty  as  charged; but remember, Yuan Ming, every author needs  to  find  a publisher. The Brontés might have missed out if they hadn’t hit on the idea of using  male  pseudonyms; and Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver would have  never  seen light if the manuscript, which he threw out of his carriage into the  publisher’s window, had been picked up from the floor by the charwoman.”

“And how about artists and musicians?”

“Think about Johann Strauss the Elder: how far would he have gone without the initial patronage of Joseph Lada? He couldn’t even read notes  when he  arrived in Vienna!” Pausing for a moment, I added: “And I suspect I  could cite example after example.”

“Alright,  Uncle Solomon” she laughed as I recovered my breath;  “you’ve  made your  point!”



Later on, over a pizza  in  a small tavern in one of the meandering lanes of  Canazei,  she opened up again, reverting to a subject we had covered before.

“Uncle, you are, of  course,  right when you say that talent alone, even if coupled with perseverance, is not an automatic ticket to success.”

“Well,” I prompted.

“I’m thinking of ‘her’. ‘She’ had the talent and, even before ‘she’ showed you ‘her’  drawings; and  ‘she’ had ‘her’ motivation: ‘she’ loved to   see  her classmates  giggling at the silliness of our teachers. So ‘she’  caricatured them.  Then you came into ‘her’ little sheltered world and, out of  the  blue, started to talk about art, about the Harlequin, about aspirations. For a  long time  ‘she’ didn’t dare to show you a thing: her courage failed  ‘her’;  ‘she’ thought  you might be amused! Then, when ‘she’ realised how much you doted  on ‘her’, she drew the little vase. The rest was plain sailing. So, as I told you before, your influence turned my tide.”

“Well then, do you concede the role of chance?”

“Not  as an independent force, Uncle” she said gently; “to me, chance  is  the hand of fate. It drives many of us to fulfilment. We discover a dormant gift. One day you will  accept  my view.”

“Perhaps,”  I said; “after all I may be moved to this conclusion by chance!”



We  left the hotel shortly after daybreak.     Despite  a short  delay  at the Austrian customs point at the Brenner  Pass,  we  reached Innsbruck  well  in  time  for our flight back to London. Late in the afternoon, we were back in the metropolis.
