### 14. Exciting Auction

“You look refreshed,” said Bill Riggs when I arrived next morning in his office.

“Thanks. And how does the case stand?”

“Our  Judge  is  back in action.  In the   pre-trial conference,  he urged the parties to settle!”

“And have you?”

“Whitehead and Blackburn won’t let us,” he said, referring to the two  fighting cocks. 

“What’s  the  matter  with  those two?”

“They had a quarrel – a shouting match – over the  Wine Stewardship of their club. Since then they are not on speaking terms.”

“How  stupid! And this childish nonsense might  cost  the  two companies a fortune in legal expenses?"

“It might; but I won’t call it childish nonsense!” said Bill.

“You wouldn’t?” I asked stunned. 

“You,  Peter, overlook the place of a club in an Englishman’s life,” said  Bill with mock severity.

“I thought his castle is his home?” I protested

“So  it  is, so it is. But the club is often  a Briton’s social  life  centre. It’s a haven: his escape from his ... noisy home; it’s where he has his peaceful dinner or a drink with his friends.”

“So a quarrel over a club matter can be a serious matter? I understand; but what are you going to do? Surely,  you can’t allow this quarrel to determine the handling of our case?”

“No,  of  course we can’t,” agreed Bill. He then went on to  explain  that  the Chairmen  of the two companies had approached a well known London banker,  Sir Osbert  Davies, to chair a mediation session to be held in two days times. Blackburn and Whitehead would listen to his peals of wisdom.

“What is so special about Sir Osbert?” I wanted to know. “Is he by any  chance a major shareholder in the two companies?”

“His  merchant  bank is, rather” answered Bill. “But this, Peter, is  not  the main  point. Sir Osbert is also the President of the very club which  has  the honour of counting Blackburn and Whitehead amongst its members!”

“Good  grief,” I expostulated. “So, in the end, it is  the  old boys net all over again!”

“So it is, old boy, so it is! Quite a lucky break, wouldn’t you say?”



For  the  next  forty minutes, I took  my  instructions  for   our  forthcoming meeting. When business  was  finished,  Bill asked unexpectedly: “Peter, have you met Sir Osbert Davies?”

“Not that I know of. Why?”

“When  we briefed him, I mentioned that you were our expert witness. From  his reaction, I gathered that your name rang a bell.”

“He might have read ‘Modern Banking Law’.”

“Could be” said Bill. “Generally, though, Sir Osbert is more interested in the Art than in the Law.”



Next morning Yuan Ming and I  made our way to Woodstock. When we arrived,  the auction  was  in full swing. A short chat with the person sitting next  to  us disclosed that furniture had fetched a good price. As expected, the bidders  had  loosened their purse strings when told the proceeds would go to a charity.

The  porcelain  pieces  were next to fall under the  hammer.   I  had an  easy  time  with the  yellow-ground  milk  jug.  The  auctioneer’s erroneous  announcement  of a hair crack to the handle drove away  the  German dealers, who were bidding over the telephone.



A change of auctioneers took place after the last piece of porcelain had been   knocked down  to  a  London  dealer.  The  relief auctioneer,  an  elegantly dressed woman in  her  mid-thirties, took  her place on the podium with  confidence.  To my delight, she  proceeded at  a considerably faster pace than the man she had  replaced,  prompting  the audience to keep up with her by an occasional show of impatience.



Most English paintings fetched reasonable rather than  high prices.  Few of them appealed to more than two or three bidders. ‘Galleon off Yarmouth’ was no exception. Roger Bates started the bidding, raising his numbered  bidding pallet resolutely. He was not awed by the presence of  so  many professionals  and  upper middle class people and did not feel  out  of  place. Indeed,  the  only concession made by him for the occasion was  his well tailored new suit.

Initially,  Roger Bates’ bids were countered by a portly  gentleman,  of about  my  own  age, whose discreet method of bidding reminded  me  of  Arthur Smithies’  tactics.  For a few minutes he kept pressing on but,  with  a quick  shake  of his head, gave up. Roger  Bates smiled happily. Then, whilst the next  painting was placed on the large easel, he rose to collect his acquisition. It was only then  that I  perceived  the  motherly and plainly dressed woman, who  had  been  sitting quietly  beside  him.  As they walked together in harmony  to  the  collection corner,  she  bestowed on him a proud smile. It dawned on me that, more often than not, the Roger  Bateses  of this world enjoyed a pleasant  existence.  Their ready  acceptance of the norms and values of their society shielded them  from the  disillusions,  the frustrations and the upheavals bred by  broad horizons, by  sophistication and by great expectations.



The  auction continued to progress smoothly and  uneventfully.  Tissot’s oil painting was  knocked  down to Yuan Ming for a  reasonable  price,  the  only opposition coming from the portly gentleman who had challenged Roger Bates. To my  surprise, he glanced at us surreptitiously a few minutes later  on.  Then, whilst  a  few hunting scenes went speedily under the  auctioneer’s  effective hammer,  I started to feel mounting excitement. Soon ‘Dawn’ was going to  take her turn.

Before  she  called  for  bids, the  auctioneer  read  out  the  revised catalogue entry. Yuan Ming was described as a “well known Chinese  artist, born in Singapore, currently  active in Los Angeles and renowned for her  neat blending  of  Eastern techniques with Western motives”. The bidding  was  then opened  at £2,000.00. I was about to raise my hand; but the  portly  gentleman came  in  first. Between us, the bidding was quickly raised to £3,200. At this point the portly gentleman gave up but a tall  middle aged man stepped into the arena.

“You  mustn’t go on biddin, Uncle” murmured Yuan  Ming  anxiously when  the  auctioneer called for £4,000.00. “He’s Jack Levine, an  art  dealer from  LA.  He  knows  me well;  and he mustn’t think I’m  bidding  on  my  own drawing.”

“But  it’s  worth  much  more than this; let me press on, just  for  a  bit; please.”

Jack  Levine nodded when the auctioneer solicited a  bid of  £5,000.00. Raising the stops between the bids to ten per cent of  the  new offer,  she  called  out, somewhat impatiently, for £5,500.00. As  soon  as  I nodded, Yuan Ming whispered resolutely: “That’s as far as you go, Uncle.”

“Six  thousand I am bid; six thousand I am bid,” the auctioneer called when  my opponent raised his hand without any change in his expression; “any bid of six thousand  five hundred?” Seeing me shake my head in resignation, she went  on: “Any further bid? None? Then for six thousand pounds I sell ...”

A  sharp  snap of fingers drew the attention of all us to a  small,  pot bellied, informally dressed man, whose loud tie matched his flushed face  with its beaky nose. Up to that moment, he had been standing unobtrusively near the entrance door without showing an interest in any of the preceding items.

“Six  thousand  five hundred from a new bidder,” chanted the auctioneer; “do I hear £7,000?”

“Uncle,” Yuan Ming was unable to contain her excitement; “Uncle, this new  chap is  David Schwarz, a famous art dealer from New York. I didn’t expect to  find him here!”

“Have you met him before?”

“I have indeed; he bought ‘Dusk’ and ‘Stormy Night’.”

“Oh  well,  so you have two Jewish experts fighting over your  masterpiece”  I said, watching keenly as the bidding continued at a breath taking speed. By the time they reached £10,000 the auctioneer,  who  had retained her cool exterior, started to raise each bid by £1,000.  Unperturbed, the  two  pressed on. Then, abruptly, it was all over: Jack Levine  shook  his head lightly and, to my surprise,  saluted his adversary. As ‘Dawn’ went under the  hammer for £19,000, Schwarz, whose expression had not changed during  the tussle, responded with an apologetic smile.

To me the rest of the auction was an anticlimax. My interest was  roused again  only when the a small landscape by a leading English artist became the subject of the  last skirmish. The bidding, though, was swift. The auctioneer called for an  amount close to the estimate so that only two interested patrons responded. After  some forty seconds, the painting was knocked down for  £25,000  to the  portly  gentleman, who, on this occasion, kept pressing on  adamantly.  I concluded that, on the previous rounds, he had but flexed his muscles.

“So this is your great day,” I said to Yuan Ming as we joined the crowd milling to the exit door.

“It was exciting, Uncle,” she conceded; “it really was!”





On the way out, we were joined by  Jack Levine. For a while, he talked to me, enquiring  about Yuan Min’s background.   Unexpectedly, we were  interrupted  by David Schwarz’s shrill voice: “Need a lift back to London, Jacob?”

“Didn’t you come on the shuttle bus?” asked Jack Levine.

“Too  slow, too slow. I’ve the hotel’s limousine waiting outside the gate.  So what d’you say?”

As the two proceeded to the front door, with David Schwarz in the  lead, Jack Levine turned back and, to my surprise, winked.



“You had quite a chat with Jack Levine, Uncle,” said Yuan Ming.

“He seems a nice chap; and he admires your work!”

“What you mean, Uncle, is that he is a nice chap because he speaks well of  my work. But, yes, Jack Levine is alright. And so is David Schwarz, despite  his manner.”

“I  suppose so,” I said grudgingly; “but how good is he? They way he talks  and dresses doesn’t inspire confidence.”

“You are prejudiced,  Uncle. I know, he isn’t as smooth as a London art critic or Art  dealer.  But  you  mustn’t judge him by their  yardstick.  Why don’t you have a guess at his background.”

“I suppose his father was grocer in Brooklyn or a tailor on the Bronx!”

“His father was a famous attorney.”

“And our friend?” I asked bewildered.

“Young  David  wanted to be an artist; so he defied Dad and went  to  an  Art School.  Later on, when he realised he wasn’t much good, he decided to become  an Art dealer. And he has made a success of it.”

“The Midas touch?”

“That  too; but he has an excellent appreciation of art and a discerning  eye. He  has  backed  some of the leading artists of today:  some  Americans,  some Israelis  and, more recently, a handful of Chinese and Burmese.”

“Oh very well,” I gave in, “it takes all kinds to make the world.”

“Yes,  Uncle:  even  the world of art. But we better look  for  Alan  Jones. Remember we want to see the other rooms of this house.”

### 15. A Remarkable Suite

Alan Jones was waiting for us in the foyer.  As the  Real Estate Agent had to keep another  appointment,  he volunteered to take us through the house on his own.

“I’m sorry you  missed out on ‘Dawn’, Sir,” he said to me.

“I’m  glad it fetched such an excellent price. I’m sure this  will boost the artist’s morale.”

“So  it should," he agreed. There had been no change in his tone or expression;  but  his swift glance in Yuan Ming’s direction told me that Alan Jones was both smart and discreet.



As soon as the last patron left the building, Alan Jones led the way  to a  corridor  hidden behind a heavy curtain. It took him a while  to  find  the right key but, eventually, he unlocked the door leading to the inner rooms  of the house.

We started our tour in the huge modernised kitchen, separated  by a  swinging  door from a dining alcove. The  brass  and  glass table  and four matching chairs contrasted pleasantly with the heavy  rosewood furniture in the elegant yet  impersonal dining room  in the public part of  the house. We then went through a set of unfurnished and  poorly  carpeted rooms.  They  were  in a shabby condition, requiring a general upgrading following  years of neglect.  A  few  broken picture  frames leaning against the walls, told me that these rooms  had  been used to store paintings.

The staircase to the second story was another eyesore. The carpet was in tatters  and the varnish on the rail had perished. Only the  servant  quarters had  been refurbished.

“I  won’t take you to the third floor,” said Alan Jones. “I suspect nobody  has climbed up for years.”

“Bringing this house up to scratch would be a challenge,” mused Yuan Ming.

“It could also be extremely expensive,” said Alan Jones. “Our tradesmen say the entire plumbing and wirings are in need of repair or replacement.”



Back at the ground floor, after a slow and wary  descent down  the ramshackle staircase, Yuan Ming pointed to a corridor we had bypassed when  we entered.

“And what sort of rooms are these?” she asked.

“They  were  Sir Arthur’s living quarters,” confided Alan Jones.  “I’m  not supposed to let anyone in.”

“Could we perhaps have a peep” she asked, smiling at him ingratiatingly.

For  just  a  moment, Alan Jones hesitated. Then, with a  shrug  of  his shoulders,  he produced his key ring. “I can’t see why not; but we  better  be quick about it.”



A  wing  of the house had been converted into a self-contained  suite.  The small  entrance  hall,  with an umbrella stand and a coat  cupboard,  led  to  a spacious  sitting  room:  well furnished, comfortable but lacking in  pomp.  I could  visualise the late Sir Arthur Smithies relaxing in the  large  armchair with  its worn leather upholstery, his feet resting on the stool  and the  remote control gadget in his hand. Had he watched the  daily   television programmes or old films stored on video cassettes? A perusal of the cabinet  brought  a smile to my face. On its middle shelf,  two  Tony  Hancock cassettes rubbed shoulders with Jacques Tati’s films. 

A high fidelity set was placed against another wall. It had both a turn-table  and a compact disk player. Few records were placed on the stand  but  the compact disks cabinet was full to its brims with choice performances of classical and modern pieces. Obviously, Arthur Smithies had  discarded most of his records,  replacing them with the better sounding and more durable compact  disks. 

Raising  my  head  from the musical corner, my eye  rested  on  a  large discoloured  space on the slightly damp wall.

“Was ‘Dawn’ hanging here?” I asked.

“I believe it was” confirmed Alan Jones.

The same  homely, relaxed, atmosphere reigned in the study. The desk  and chair   turned  out to be old acquaintances. Both came from  Arthur  Smithies’ office  in Birchin Lane.             As in a trance, I walked over to the large book case and the collapsible library  steps  placed in front it. My own books were resting on  a shelf  devoted  to law. A large cardboard box,  stationed  beside them, was labelled “Berger’s offprints”. Right beneath them, amongst works  on copyright  and  patents,  I  came across a thin  unfamiliar  tome.  The  title imprinted  on its back  read: “Introduction to the Law of Patents”  by  Arthur Smithies,  BA  MA (Cantab.), of the Middle Temple, Barrister at Law.  

A splendid array of old master and modern prints and lithographs decorated the walls. Yuan Ming and  Alan  Jones became  immersed  in   William  Blake’s  ‘The  Three Friends Accusing Job’. 

“Isn’t  it profound, Uncle?” asked Yuan Ming. “The way each of  the  ‘friends’ points his finger at the stricken patriarch.”

“Quite   a devastating indictment of human nature,” I consented. “And  what  do you think of it, Mr Jones?”

“It  is  brilliant,”  he  agreed;  “but I  couldn’t  live  with  it.  It’s  too depressing. Coming to think of it, so are the other prints in this room.”

“Is it because they are so candid about human frailties?” asked Yuan Ming. She had been staring, fascinated,  at Rembrandt’s Eve tempting Adam by pressing the  forbidden apple possessively against her bare bosom whilst the snake was smiling  malevolently.

“Perhaps,” said Alan Jones. “The truth be told: I do find the scenes  of  the hunt and of the stormy seas more pleasing.”

“Coming  to think of it,” I changed the subject rather abruptly, “are there  no traditional English paintings in the suite?”     

“Wait till you see the bedroom” said Alan Jones, breaking into a smile.



The comfortable double bed had a traditional brass frame and  headboard. On the wall above  hung  a large  rural scene mounted in a simple wooden frame.

“Constable?” I asked assertively.

“It is: an  unrecorded  Constable; and he left it to the National Gallery,” replied Alan  Jones  with  an unexpected display of emotion.



Yuan  Ming was captivated by the fine landscape. My less interested  eye started  to rove around the room. A sliding door opened to the bathroom.  Its modern basin,  tub  and fittings  were  of  the  finest  quality.  But  there  was  no  trace  of  the  extravagant splendour of the bathroom in the public part of the house. 



Alan  Jones’ discreet cough reminded us that our visit was supposed  to be  brief.  At  the  very  same moment, though, I  caught  sight  of  a  small rectangular show case in one of the corners of the room.

“Uncle,” asked Yuan Ming whose glance had followed mine, “are these the cup  and saucer?”

“They are indeed,” I responded in a voice turned inaudible.



Apart from my own gift, the show case contained a few  enamel  snuff  boxes and some  silver cups and  tankards  which,  I  felt certain,  were gifts from staff and from satisfied clients. I then  spotted  a small brocade box housing a  locket.  One miniature  photograph  was  of  Arthur Smithies in  his  twenties;  the  other  depicted a girl with a stylish coiffure, an aquiline nose and Nordic features.  A full calf bound edition of “Great Expectations” occupied the lowest shelf.



“Were  you looking for this cup and saucer in the first preview?”  asked  Alan Jones in a voice that allayed my fears of testing his patience. “Diane told me you asked if we had such a piece in the auction.”

“It’s Vienna, about 1804. I gave it to him when  I finished my Oxford thesis: he had been most helpful to me.”

“So you did know him quite well?”

“I  thought I did,” I heard myself say; “but I’m not so sure any  longer:  this suite – it is full of surprises.”

“Is it the contrast between this suite and the other rooms?” asked Alan Jones.

“That  too,  although,  even  before I saw this suite,  I  found  it  hard  to associate those showy rooms with the man I knew.”

“What is it then?” asked Yuan Ming.

“The  decor. I didn’t know and would have never guessed that  Arthur  Smithies collected prints and had an interest in modern art.”

“But you knew about ‘Dawn’?” she pointed out.

“I thought it was a one off; but alright then: perhaps I should have  expected to find some other modern paintings. But how about the prints? He knew I was a collector. Occasionally, I talked to him about prints I had seen in  auctions. But he never referred to his own interest!”

“He was quite secretive about it,” said Alan Jones. “He got most of his  prints from  dealers in Vienna and Paris; and, from time to time, he  commissioned these dealers to bid in our own auctions on his behalf but in their names!”

“How about his English paintings” I asked “did he get them at Christie’s?”

“Quite a few of them; when he couldn’t attend, Diane took his telephone bids. And he  got his porcelain in London auctions. Diane liked to handle his bids:  she said he was a ‘real gent’.”

“How do you explain this secrecy about the prints?” I asked.

“We have no idea. But I can tell you this much: he did everything he could  to cover  his  tracks. Apart from some three or four prints which he  left  to  a friend  in the City, the collection is to be sold in our next sale  of  prints  as  ‘the property of a Gentleman’. His will precluded their inclusion  in  the sale of his household!”

“I can’t make head or tails of this scenario,” I said after a pause.

“Neither can we,” confessed Alan Jones.

“I  take  it  that he did not admit guests into these rooms,”  I  added  as  an afterthought.

“He didn’t,” said Alan Jones emphatically. “The servants say he received all his guests in the open part of the house. But he didn’t really have many  callers.  During the last few years, he led the life of a recluse.”



I could sense that Yuan Ming wanted to get out of the orphaned suite. I, too,  craved  for a breath of fresh air. When we were back in the open rooms, Yuan Ming said to Alan Jones: “Thanks  for  showing us the house; but it’s too big and the renovations are bound to be expensive.”

“I understand,” smiled Alan Jones. “Well, our agent might have  something more suitable in Banbury or in Iffley. I’ve got his card  with me.” Handing it to Yuan Ming, he added: “I believe one of the houses in Iffley has  a  loft,  which  could be easily converted into a  nice  studio  with  an excellent view.”



We  returned to the car park on the last shuttle bus. Most of  the  other passengers  were  Christie’s employees. The snippets  of  their  conversation, which  reached  my ears, centred on ‘Dawn”. They, too, had found  the  bidding exciting.



“I think I better drive us back to London” said Yuan Ming when we got back  to our car. “You look shattered, Uncle.”

“I am, rather,” I confessed. “I still find a great deal of what we’ve  seen  in these rooms incomprehensible!”

“I’m  sure  we’ll find the right answers sooner or later, Uncle,”  she  replied, patting my shoulder.

### 16. A Solomon Judgment

Next morning, my  taxi stopped in front of Bill Riggs’ office block at  8.55 a.m.  The solicitors,  their assistants, the other party’s expert and the  two  fighting cocks  were already seated around  the  conference table.  Two elderly  gentleman  came in shortly thereafter. These, whispered  Bill  Riggs, were  the Chairmen of the Boards of the two companies. They  had,  apparently, held a brief preliminary meeting in an adjacent room.

Sir  Osbert  Davies  kept us waiting for 15 minutes.   I  had  my  first surprise when he arrived: he was none other than the portly gentleman of   the auction  at Woodstock. I was startled again after he had walked resolutely  to the  Chair,  mumbling some apologies for being late. Just before he  took  his seat, he winked at me conspiratorially!

Thereafter  business was brisk. Within a few minutes Sir Osbert  made it  clear that he failed to comprehend why the dispute had not been settled amicably. The two firms had enjoyed an excellent business relationship for years and had to  continue trading with each other. Small disagreements and disputes had  to be  sorted  out  without fuss. If the two companies destroyed their joint operations by petty mindedness, foreign competitors would eagerly pick up the business.

“It’s a matter of principle” said Whitehead.

“What principle?” asked Sir Osbert.

“Of  honesty in dealings!” Pointing his finger at Blackburn,  Whitehead  added furiously:  “This fellow must not be allowed to get away with his filthy  pack of lies!”

“How dare you, you ...” started Blackburn, but was cut short by Sir Osbert:

“I  am not going to tolerate any abusive language in this meeting – and  this goes  for both of you: Philip Whitehead and Tony Blackburn. I just won’t  have it!” He had raised his voice but his eyes, I noticed, remained cold.

“But surely, I have the right to express my views,” said Whitehead defensively.

“As  long  as  you express them civilly,” answered Sir  Osbert  severely.  “Our object today is to sort things out – not to perpetuate a petty personal feud.”

“I resent that,” exclaimed Whitehead, raising his voice in a vain attempt to  regain his  previous  position of strength; “you have no right to bring  club  gossip to ...”.

“I  have  the right to control this meeting and I  intend  to exercise it. You better get that straight, Philip!”

“How dare you speak to me like that” yelled Whitehead; “who do you think ...”

“Shut  up, Philip,  shut up!” interrupted Sir Osbert in a tone that brought  a flush to Whitehead’s face.



For the next half hour, Sir Osbert went through the documents pertaining to  the  dispute, including the depositions of the witnesses of fact  and  the experts’  reports.  His analysis, I thought, was lucid and well  balanced.  He concluded – as had all of us  before him – that the outcome of  the  case depended  on  the  Judge's  assessment of the  reliability  of  the  two  main witnesses: Whitehead and Blackburn. His reasoning, he added,  was based on the useful reports of the two expert witnesses.

“But Professor Berger concludes that we are in the right,” insisted Whitehead.

“Care to comment, Professor?” asked Sir Osbert.

“What  I say is that, if the Judge accepts Mr Whitehead’s testimony, we  ought to win the case,” I explained.

“But you show that the documents support what I say!” persisted Whitehead.

“I  show in my Report that some documents do; but I have had  to concede  that other documents go against us.”

“But that’s double Dutch,” exclaimed Whitehead.

“No,  it  isn’t,” intervened Sir Osbert. “Mr Barlow for the other side  had  to make  similar concessions. Professor Berger, am I right in concluding that  in this  type  of situation the Judge has to base his decision  on  his  personal assessment of the witnesses?”

“Precisely,” I agreed.

“But  how could he possibly believe Blackburn?” wailed Whitehead.  “His  story doesn’t make sense.”

“It does – much more so than your confused letters!” countered Blackburn,  who had kept his tempter until this moment.

“Only  the  Judge  will decide which version makes  sense,”  said  Sir  Osbert. “Professor  Berger,  could you please tell us how a Judge makes  up  his mind in this type of case?”

“When  the  facts are neatly balanced,” I said readily, “the Judge  can  use only  one  criterion: his own subjective assessment of the witnesses.  So the outcome is bound to depend on whether he believes A or B.  Most judges hate this type of situation and try to persuade the parties to  settle. But if the parties don’t reach an agreement, the Judge has to decide.”

“But  I’m  positive  he’ll  believe me,” Whitehead's  voice  was  charged  with emotion; “it’s a matter of simple justice.”

“Famous  last words,” said Sir Osbert Davies contemptuously. “As the  Professor has just indicated, the Judge has to rely on his impressions  and, of  course, the Judge  is human. I consider it impossible to predict the outcome. I gather Professor  Berger and Mr Barlow are, basically, of the same view. Can we  have the views of the legal advisers?”

“We are of the same view,” said Bill Riggs, whilst his counterpart simply said: “I Agree.”

“In  the  circumstances,” said Sir Osbert, “I consider it imperative  that  the case  be settled forthwith. I have studied the draft agreement dated 29  April and  consider it a fair and just solution. I urge both parties to accept it as is!”

“And if we don’t?” asked Whitehead, trying to sound defiant.

“Then I shall recommend to my bank that we withdraw the facilities granted  to both  firms.” Sir Osbert did not raise his voice, but the reaction of all  the businessmen  in  the room left no doubt about the impact left  by  his  words. Unperturbed,  he  continued:  “As you well know,  both  companies  experienced certain financial setbacks during the last few years. Acting as the lead bank, we  took a substantial risk when we arranged the syndicated loan facilities  I am referring to. We went ahead despite this risk because we concluded that the operations of both companies were of considerable importance to British trade. But  I  am not prepared to assume any further risks, or to  throw  good  money after  bad, when the two companies indulge themselves in the pursuit of  petty quarrels.”

“We  can get our funding elsewhere,” countered Whitehead in a new fit of  rage; “you are pointing a pistol at our heads.”

“I  am  indeed,” affirmed Sir Osbert. “And you better cool down  before  you make me pull the trigger. Once again, I urge each company to  place the proposed settlement forthwith before a meeting of its Board of Directors.”

“Perhaps I should mention that, following a short meeting of the two  Chairmen earlier  this morning,  such meetings have already been called;  I  understand each Board is to meet this afternoon,” volunteered  Bill Riggs.

“Quite so,” said the two Chairmen in unison.

“Without consulting me?” asked Whitehead; turning to his own Chairman he added with a touch of bitterness: “I thought I was the General Manager.”

“So  you are,” replied his Chairman. “But this case has gone out of hand and  I have  felt for some time that a settlement is desirable. As Sir  Osbert has  explained at the outset, our two companies have to go on  cooperating  in our  trading activities. Our Board’s meeting is scheduled for 4.00 p.m.  in  our Convention Room. Your presence, Philip,  will, of course, be appreciated.”

“I do not propose to come,” said Whitehead, who had turned pale.

“As  you wish,” answered his Chairman; “still, in your own interest, you  ought to be there. Why don’t you think the matter over during lunch.” For a  moment, I  thought Whitehead was going to reply. Then, to everyone’s relief,  he  rose from his seat and left the room.

“How about you, Tony?” asked the other company’s Chairman.

“Do  you  think I should attend?” asked Blackburn who,  though  deflated,  had remained  in  control  of  himself.  “I mean,  do  you  consider  my  presence desirable?”

“You should attend, especially if you feel you are able to  accept the proposed settlement.”

“On  final  reflection,” said Blackburn with an effort, “I believe I  can  live with it.”



All  in attendance started to collect their documents. Before  we  rose, Bill  Riggs thanked Sir Osbert Davies.  He,  in turn,  asked  the  parties to contact him if they felt that  he  could  be  of further assistance. I was getting ready to take my leave but was pre-empted  by Sir Osbert: “Can I give  you a lift, Professor Berger?”

### 17. Recognising an Old Friend

On our way to the carpark, we talked about the case. To my surprise, Sir Osbert made a number of favourable comments about Philip Whitehead. He praised the policies Whitehead had pursued during his five years with his company  and  described his conduct in the instant dispute as out of character.  Then, as I fastened the safety belt, Sir Osbert said without a change in his voice:

“Hopefully,  Philip Whitehead will soon be back to normal. But, be this as  it may, I only hope you didn’t find our stormy meeting too trying, Peter!”

“Not at all” I replied mechanically; then, as the gist of his address sank in, I looked at him in poorly disguised amazement.

“You are somewhat slow to recognise an old friend” he said with a smile.

For a few seconds I stared at him searchingly. Then,  at long last, the smoke  lifted itself. Camouflaged behind the double chin, the receding  hair, the  thick glasses and the wrinkled face, I recognised my acquaintance  of days long gone bye:

“Brian ...?”

“Have I really changed that much?” he asked sadly  and, whilst I was searching for  words, went on: “I suppose it’s the effect of all these  expense  account luncheons, the sumptuous dinners, the endless drinks and, between you and  me, my not exercising enough.”

“It’s not  your  appearance” I told him truthfully. “It is,  rather,  your  proper name,  although I should have really known: I knew your initials  were  B.R.O. But,  you  see, although I’ve lived in Anglo-Saxon societies  for  years,  I’m still ...”

“Occasionally perplexed by our impervious ways?”

“You could put it like that, Brian ... I mean, Sir Osbert.”

“I’m still ‘Brian’ to my old friends!”

“Let me congratulate you, belatedly, on your Knighthood. Was it for your work in the Gulf?”

“That, and my contributions to certain Committees. Some people thought it came earlier than deserved.”

“I’m  sure that’s nonsense,” I said, once again myself. “But, I hope you  don’t mind if I ask: what made you prefer ‘Osbert’ to ‘Brian’?"

“But  I  didn’t,"  he burst out laughing. “It was,  rather,  Ruth’s  idea.  She thought  that  ‘Sir Osbert Davies’ sounded better than ‘Sir  Brian  Davies’.”  Noting  my perplexed glance, he added: “Not that Ruth has become a snob;  she’s still the same old girl. But she had always liked the sound of ‘Osbert’.”

“And  what  did  Mary  Jane and Jonathan have to say – I  take  it  they  were consulted?”

“So  you have a better memory for names than for faces,” said Brian,  gratified. “And, yes, they were consulted. Mary Jane agreed with Mom. She said the  ‘Nobs’ had no monopoly over ‘fine’ English names. Jonathan was neutral: he said  that to him I’ll always be Dad.”

“I see; but tell me: what are Mary Jane and Jonathan doing?”

“Mary  Jane is a vet – one of the few women in the profession.  She  practises although she is married and has two kids. Jonathan did electronic engineering but,  some two years ago, joined a business firm. He says he’ll  make his first million before he’s thirty five!”

“Good luck to him,” I said, slightly amused. “And is he married?”

“Not  formally. But he has been living with the same girl  since his University days. She rules him just as firmly  as  his  Mom rules  his Dad! They say they’ll get married if they decide to have  children. At  first Ruth urged them to do the right thing  presently; but later on she accepted the situation. She has become very fond of  Rosalind and treats her like a daughter.”

“And  where  do  you  live now? I  remember  you  bought  a property in Stanmore.”

“We’re still living there. I wanted to move to an Edwardian house in Mayfair a few years ago but Ruth was against it. So I purchased our neighbour’s house and converted the two into one large  property. Ruth drew the basic plan. It’s turned out very nicely.”

“I’m delighted, Brian.”

“And  how are things with you, Peter? You have done very well  professionally: Arthur  Smithies used to tell me about your work. But how is everything  else? Did you move back to Singapore for your wife’s sake?”

“Partly,” I told him truthfully. “It was the best thing I could do for her. But there were other attractions like the salary and, frankly speaking,  something personal. You see, my marriage  has not  been a great success. Still, Pat and I are still together; but during  the  last few years, Brian, ... a ray of light has entered into my life.”

“The young woman who was with you at the auction?”

“Her name is Yuan Ming. I told you a great deal about her the last time we met!”

“But that was ages ago!” Brian gave a start. “Hold on,” he proceeded, “so she is  the little girl you talked about over our lunch, isn’t she?”

“She  is,  rather. We had lost touch when I  left  Singapore  and then, when I had almost given up all hope of seeing her and her father again, I stumbled into their new shop!”

“What a strange coincidence!” His voice remained even but, for just a flicker, his  expression changed perceptibly. “I recall our conversation  clearly.  You appeared engrossed in your work and steered back to it when I asked about your personal  life. But your face lit up when you told me about little Yuan  Ming: you  became  animated. And I assume ‘Dawn’ is her work, isn’t it?”

“It  is”  I  said  and kept talking  about  Yuan Ming and her art until we reached Marble Arch.

“I’m  glad  to  see  you are happy, Peter, I really am. And, Peter,  are you free for  lunch?”

“I am: only it’s my turn really.”

“Nonsense. You’ll take me out when I visit you in Singapore.”

### 18. Lunch Down Memory Lane

After some fifteen minutes we stopped in front of a smart restaurant  in Mayfair. Leaving the car in charge of a valet, Sir Osbert Davies – whose  role Brian  played  to  perfection – led the way to a table at a  bay  window.  The deference  of the waiters and of the Chef, who stepped out of the  kitchen  to welcome  him,  brought a discreet smile to my face.   Still,  once he had ordered our meals and  a  bottle  of wine, my host metamorphosed again into his old  alter ego.



As  was to be expected, we spent some time exchanging news about  common friends  in the English banking and business world, savouring the  success  of some  and the untimely retirement or demise of others. Eventually,  under  the influence  of  the  excellent wine, Brian started to talk  happily  about  his grandchildren.



A  short  lull in our conversation took place when a  waiter uncorked  the second bottle. When he departed, I steered the conversation to Sir Arthur Smithies. I was not surprised to  learn that Brian had, occasionally, called on him in Epping and that, more recently, he had dinner with him in Woodstock.

“We had a drink in the library followed by a formal dinner in that huge dining room.”

“Just the two of you?”

“Quite. It gave me an uncanny feeling.”

“Didn’t you find the entire house weird, Brian?” I asked.

“I wouldn’t put it that strongly; but, yes, I was puzzled.”

“Because  it was out of character?”

“Not really; it struck me was as a place suitable for housing Arthur Smithies’ collection. I was, rather, surprised not to find certain things in it.”

“Such as?”

"His  old desk, for instance. Roger Bates told me that Arthur Smithies had personally supervised the removal of his desk and  chair  from  his old office. Later on, I spotted them  in  his  study  in Epping.  Their   replacement  by  the grand desk  and  elegant  chair  in  the Woodstock house was out of character.”

“Anything else, in the house or, perhaps, at the auction?” I wanted to know.

“Well,”  he  said after an inner struggle, “I think it’s alright  to  tell  you about  it now: Arthur Smithies had a fine collection of   prints.  I still wonder why there was no trace of them at the auction.”

“The answer is simple, Brian” I told him. “The prints as well as the desk  and office chair are in a self contained suite, or bachelor’s flat, on the  ground floor. This was Arthur Smithies’ real abode.”

“How on earth did you find out?” Brian looked thunderstruck.

“Yuan Ming and I gained access to it yesterday, after the auction.”



Brian Davies listened attentively to my description of Arthur  Smithies’ hidden  rooms.  He interrupted me for the first time when  I  described  the books I saw in the study.

“Did you have a good look at the shelves with the English novels?”

“I’m afraid not,” I had to admit. “Do you have a specific book in mind?”

“As a matter of fact, I do. It’s ‘Great Expectations’.”

“A fine full calf bound edition?”

“Precisely,” he said eagerly.

“It’s  not on the shelves. It is, rather, in a cabinet in which he kept  gifts and trophies. A Vienna cup and saucer I gave him before I left Oxford is  also there.”

“I  know them. He showed them to me shortly after you went to Singapore,”  said Brian, overtly moved. “The book is from me. I presented it to him when he left Crawfords. Can you recall any other items you saw in the cabinet?”

Brian was able to identify some snuff boxes. He then turned, somewhat uneasily, to the locket.

“During  his  early years at the Bar, Arthur Smithies was often  seen  in  the company of Vivian Armstrong, a successful Chancery Junior from the Chambers in 11-12, Grey’s Inn Square. Rumour had it that they were engaged to be  married. But,  in  the end, no announcement was made and they appear  to  have  drifted apart. I’m sure she gave him the locket.”

“What a  pity  they  didn’t  get married.”

“I  am not sure I agree with you. Arthur Smithies was  very much  his  own  man.  He  might have found it  hard  to  accept  the  everyday compromises dictated by marriage.”



Brian was equally interested in my description of the remaining rooms in the  suite. He wanted details  about the prints. I was impressed when he identified a number of  them from my description. Some turned out to be rare and valuable.

“Brian,”  I  asked when I had completed my description of the  suite,  “why,  on earth,  did Arthur Smithies lead such a schizophrenic existence? I  mean,  why did he need both the opulent open rooms and the hidden suite. I have no  doubt that he felt at home in the suite. So why did he need the façade of the  other rooms. I am satisfied that Arthur Smithies was not a show-off.”

“Of course not,” confirmed Brian. “What bothers you about  the two separate pArt of the house?”

“They are incompatible with each other!”

“Viewed  as two homes, they are,” he answered readily. “But the open rooms were not meant to be Arthur Smithies’ home. They  were the rooms of a grand mansion, housing his collection of  artefacts. He wanted his guests to enjoy them. The suite was his living quarters: the place in which he dressed informally, discarding his suit and putting on a pullover or cardigan  and a comfortable pair of trousers: the place in which he relaxed and felt at home.”

“But  why  did he keep its existence in the dark. You were, I  believe,  close  to  him.  But even you were never told, let  alone  invited  to enter these rooms?”

“As  you  well  know,  Peter, Arthur Smithies was a  very  reserved  man,  who cherished  his privacy. Perhaps  he felt  that the existence of these ‘hidden rooms’  was  no one else’s business.”

“Isn’t this an extreme example of the privacy fetish; doesn’t it verge on the absurd?”

“Perhaps  it does, Peter,” conceded Brian; “but, then, Arthur Smithies  was an unusual man.”

“And why this secrecy about the prints? He never mentioned them in his letters to me although he knew I was a fellow collector. He was, at the same time, communicative about his Meissen artefacts. Actually, I wonder if you were  the only person who knew about his collection of prints.”

“Perhaps I was; and, as a matter of fact, I found out by chance.”

“How?”

“I met him in a dealer’s shop in Amsterdam. When I came in,  he was in the process of paying for a Goya. He reacted like a boy  caught with  jam on his fingers. Still, the cat was out the bag and so we started  to talk about prints. He was quite knowledgeable.”

“This  still doesn’t explain why he was so secretive about them.  And,  Brian, how can one man have an interest in both these prints and in the paintings  we have  seen on the walls of the house?”

“I quite agree with your assessment of these paintings. I made  those bids for ‘Galleons off Yarmouth’ to boost Roger Bates’ ego. I didn’t want him  to  sense  that  no one else in the room had an  interest  in  his  dream painting.”

“I see; and you are a very kindly man, Brian.”

“Oh, come off it,” said Brian suddenly all flustered. “It was just a supportive gesture.”

“But how about the contrast between the prints in the ‘hidden rooms’ and the paintings?”

“I can’t be certain,” said Brian, after having pondered for a while; “but let’s see  if  we can come up with a good hunch. Basically, how would  you  describe these prints?”

“All  of  them  deal  with  human  emotions: Eve’s  insatiable curiosity;  Man’s  cruelty in war; the horror inspired  by  the apocalypse and so and so on.”

“And the paintings?”

“They  are expressions of harmony and grandeur: of Man’s achievements.”

“These,  of  course, suit the elegant furniture,  the fine  porcelain  with  its quaint paintings, and they  are in harmony with  the  atmosphere  Arthur Smithies’ grand house.”

“Quite so,” I agreed.

“Perhaps,” said Brian reflectively, “these paintings – and the open rooms as a whole – represent the solidity toward which, Arthur Smithies felt,  we ought to strive. The prints reflect the controversies of  life,  the emotions  and  obsessions which drive us, every now and  then,  to  irrational actions.”

“Like Philip Whitehead’s behaviour,” it was my turn to reflect.

“Precisely,”  agreed Brian readily. “I believe that, in his own way,  Arthur Smithies was both aware of the effects of inner turmoil  and was mesmerised by them.”

“That,”  I said “would also explain what attracted him to ‘Dawn’ and the  other modern,  abstract  but  highly emotive, paintings  displayed  in  his  ‘hidden rooms’.

“Spot on,” said Brian. 

“How  very  strange,”  I said after a pause. “How very strange that  a  man  of Arthur Smithies’ background would reflect on these aspects of life. I knew,  of course,  that he was a sensitive and sophisticated man. But I  had  not realised that he had stepped so far out into the ... twilight zone.”

“But,  Peter, how much do you really know about  Arthur  Smithies background?”

“Not  much; I assumed that – like yourself –  he came from the ranks of  the professional middle classes.”

“Wrong  on both points," said Brian, who, to my relief, was amused rather  than annoyed by what had, obviously, been a gaff.

"How?" I asked.

“Well,  my father was a businessman in Peterborough.  He  was quite  successful  but we were  a long shot removed from the ‘professional’ upper middle classes.”

“But  your accent,” I said bewildered. “To me it didn’t - and still  doesn’t  - sound ‘Midlands’.”

“So  I’ve fooled you about my accent, haven’t I?” said Brian in such  a  heavy Midlands accent that I broke into a smile.

“You rather have! When did you change over?”

“Just before I went up to Cambridge. It was really mom’s idea. She doted on me and did everything she could to ensure my ‘future’.  One of  her best ideas was to persuade me to ‘learn to speak English like  a  real gentleman’.  It  helped me in my interview at King’s and opened the  doors  to Crawfords.” Smiling at me, he added: “ ‘Osbert’, too, was her idea. She thought that such a fine proper name would stand me in good stead at the right time.”

“Alright, then,” I came back to my main point; “but you said I was wrong twice. So  what  was Arthur Smithies background? He appeared the epitome  of  an executive in an  English aristocratic bank.”

“He was; and he had the necessary credentials and the  appropriate upbringing,”  agreed  Brian. “But the full story is considerably  more  complex than what meets the eye. You see, Peter, Arthur Smithies’ great grandfather was a successful businessman in Manchester. His name, I gather,  was Peter Smith or, possibly, Peter Schmidt.”

“A migrant from Germany?”

“He  was, I am told, born in England. His father had migrated either,  as  you suggest, from Germany or from the Netherlands. After he had made his  fortune, Peter  Smith  came down to London to look for  even  bigger  and better opportunities. Well, it didn’t take him long to find a suitable target. The  City  was,  at  that  time,  full  of  rumours  about  certain  financial difficulties faced by Crawford, Fairbairn,  Miles, Lawson  & Co. Concluding that merchant bank  had a sound base, Peter Smith  injected the capital required for its recovery; and he married Juliana Crawford,  third daughter  of  the  senior  partner, a girl  some  twenty  years  younger  than himself.”

“Quite a man!” I broke in. “And, obviously, his financial gamble paid off.”

“Didn’t  it  ever!” affirmed Brian. “Within ten years the  bank  regained  its prominent position and  established excellent relations  with some Dutch and German banks. It soon became an intermediary for trade  between the  East Coast of the United States and Central Europe.”

“And the bank remained a sort of family business.”

“It did. The partners consolidated  the bank’s standing by marrying into the families of successful lawyers and of wealthy businessmen and industrialists in Britain, the Continent and the States. Some of them joined the bank. So it changed its name from time to time; and the ‘Smiths’ changed their name to ‘Smithies’.”

“How did Arthur Smithies get into the lead. I though he had opted for a career at the Bar?”

“He did, rather. But circumstances dictated his final move. Originally, his older  brother,  Archibald,  was considered   more suitable for the job. Archie was a an  easy  going, affable,  man  with  all the social graces. People liked  to  deal  with  him. Arthur, in contrast, was a reserved and shy young man. But he had his ancestors’  sharp  mind. A career at the Bar appeared  just right for him.”

“I  believe  I can put the rest of the jigsaw together.” I nodded. “He  had  a  successful start  at the Bar and, eventually, chose to specialise in a  newly  developing field:  copyright  and  patents. I suspect that – in due course – Archibald proved himself  unable to handle the affairs of the Bank during times of  turbulence. So the sedate and resourceful Arthur had to take over. Was it a family decision?”

“It was.”

“So, all in all,” I mused, “far from being the scion of a pure old English family, Arthur  Smithies  came from a somewhat ... mixed background?”

“You are surprised, aren’t you?” grinned Brian.

“I am: to me he appeared a typical upper middle class Englishmen.”

“He  left  that impression on most people he met; and I don’t think it  was  a mere façade. In most ways, he was just that.”

“But, at the same time, there were some other inner forces pulling him in very different directions.”

“I think so,” said Brian, “but we can’t be certain.”

“True,”  I had to agree; “but what you’ve just told me sheds  new light on  the public  section  of the house and on the ‘hidden room’. Their  coexistence  no longer  appears incompatible with his character.  Like  Arthur Smithies’ background and outlook they were moulded by chance!”

“Chance,” replied Brian vigorously, “or, as I prefer to put it, a series of  events each triggered off by another, like the ripples created by  a pebble thrown into a clear pool.” Breaking into a smile, he went on: “And now, Peter, you know as much about Arthur Smithies’ background as myself!”

“Thanks for telling me” I said.

“Anything else you like to know?” he asked, still smiling.

“As a matter of fact there is: do you know what became of Vivian Armstrong?”

“She  died of an attack of pneumonia, just a few years after Arthur  Smithies joined  Crawfords. I was told he appeared subdued during that period  and dressed  even  more sombrely than usually. And, Peter, I know  for  sure  that Vivian Armstrong remained single.”



Taking  advantage of the lull in our conversation, the waiter came  over to fill our coffee cups and to remove our dessert plates. Having found out all I  wanted to know about my late friend, I thought it appropriate to steer  the conversation  back  to Brian’s own affairs. He told me, willingly,  about  his position  in  his  merchant bank and his general  role  in  London’s  thriving banking  community. He was, obviously, pleased to talk about his  achievements but,  at the same time, his tone remained sober. He became  more  enthusiastic  when I asked about his collection of prints.

“My  collection  has been growing steadily over the years. You  may recall  that I prefer modern prints to the old masters. I have prints  of  all the modern leading artists, excellent prints! To tell you the truth, Peter, I am giving serious thought  to  early retirement  from  the  bank.  If I do, I shall turn  my  hobby  into  a lucrative business.”

“But, surely, you cannot possibly open an art gallery, can you?”

“As  ‘Brian  Davies’ I could; but, as you imply, not as ‘Sir  Osbert  Davies’;  and, even if I wanted to defy convention, Ruth won’t let  me. Still,  one  of Mary Jane’s friends has just finished her BA  and  aspires  to become an Art dealer. I have had a chat with her. I would, of course, remain in remote control.”

“But why do you want to retire from the City. You are at the very peek of your career, Brian!”

“And that, Peter, is not a bad time to quit. I’d rather go whilst I’m riding high than when I sense the tide has turned  and I’ve  outlived  my usefulness; and, quite apart from that, I am  beginning  to lose interest. I’ve been at the helm for far too long.”

“I understand. Sometime I, too, feel fed up with what I’m  doing. I’ve  been  teaching law and writing legal monographs and  articles for years. I am getting sick and tired of it.”

“What do you propose to do?"

“As  soon as I’ve sorted things out, I intend to devote myself to Yuan  Ming’s career; and I want to try my hand at some short stories and perhaps a novel.”

“I’m glad you have made your plans,” said Brian warmly. “You know, Peter,  time has  not stood still for either of us; but you, too, contemplate a new  start: you haven’t lost your aspirations.”

“I haven’t” I confirmed. “I continue to look forward to the future. But how about Arthur Smithies, Brian, had he lost heart?”

“I don’t think so” said Brian with conviction. “I believe that in those hidden rooms,  the rooms which you have been privileged to see, he was the man both of us knew at Crawfords.”



Discreetly, the waiter placed a silver plate with the neatly folded bill next  to  Brian’s  side plate. He settled it in cash and, I  noticed,  left  a generous tip.

Although I should have preferred to walk to Marble Arch Station, I  felt obliged  to  accept  Brian’s offer to drop me in front  of  my  hotel.  Having exhausted   both  our personal news  and  the  subject  of  Arthur Smithies,  Brian turned back to the legal proceedings that had brought  me  to London.  It  soon  emerged  that, like myself, he had  been  moved  by  Philip Whitehead’s  bitterness and was inclined to accept his version  of  the facts. Both of us, though, were convinced that most judges would come down  on the side of the more sedate and dignified Tony Blackburn.

“In effect,” I told Brian “we delivered  a Solomon’s judgment. Being unable  to discover conclusive evidence in support of either party we divided the loss in equal shares. ‘A’ didn’t win but ‘B’ didn’t lose.  I  only hope the episode has not ruined the  careers  of  Blackburn and Whitehead.”

“Time will tell,” replied Brian.



Shortly thereafter we arrived at the hotel.  Shaking his hand warmly,  I thanked him for his hospitality.  I  watched his car until it disappeared around the corner. It was  only then  that I realised I had been driven in a Bentley.

### 19. Rerouting a Flight

Back in my room, I kept musing about Brian  – now Sir Osbert – Davies, comparing  his decisive progress with the slow downhill trend in  Arthur Smithies’  career. Was it possible  that in our fast moving age a rough diamond had brighter prospects than a polished one? After all, even the finest of diamonds had, in the very least, one flaw.

My  reverie  was  disrupted  by  the four  chimes  of  a  nearby  clock. Instantly,  my mind swung to Yuan Ming. Why had she not rung? Did she  go  for some  shopping?  Despite my persistent calls, the receiver in her flat was not picked up.  Had there  been an unfavourable development respecting her deal? Had some  of  the pieces proved to be fakes? The purchasers were, undoubtedly, ruthless  people. Was she in danger? Anxiously, I started to pace the floor with my arms pressed tightly to my sides. Then, as if in response to a prayer, the telephone rang.

“So you are back, Uncle!”

“Yes; but where have you been? It’s nearly four thirty?”

“Don’t  tell  me you worried about me? I’m not a ‘little Yuan Ming’ any longer, you know.”

“It’s just because of the deal; I feared something went wrong!”

“And the nasty men kidnapped me” she burst out laughing. “They haven’t paid yet: remember! So if they aren’t pleased  they can call the deal off. So what would they want with me?”

“Sorry,” I conceded contritely; “I am getting rather edgy, and it is getting late.”

“I  understand, you Old Silly. I’m late because we went to see the  expert  on bronzes in the British Museum, who took his time; and then the three of us had a  late lunch in Gerard Street. But where have you been:  there was no answer when I rang about an hour ago.”

“Sir Osbert Davies took me out for lunch!”

“So you are climbing up in the world, Respected Uncle: rubbing  shoulders with  the high and mighty; soon you’ll rise above the standard of  your  plain Yuan Ming. Don’t tell me you had been driven in a Silver Hawk?”

“In a Bentley, rather. But Sir Osbert isn’t really Sir Osbert...”

“Uncle, are you reciting ‘The Hunting of the Snark’?”

“I  am not! And Sir Osbert isn’t a Bojum. He is, rather, the portly  gentleman who started the bidding on ‘Dawn’ yesterday.”

“The fat chap who kept staring at us?”

“The  very  same. You see, he turned out to be an old friend about  whom  I’ve told you – I mean ‘her’ – long ago.”

“Don’t  tell  me  he’s your old friend Brian Davies,” she  burst  out  laughing merrily.  “You told ‘her’ he was an elegant,  athletic and suave  upper  middle class  young Englishmen! No wonder  he tried to attract your attention by bidding for ‘Dawn’. When did you  recognise him?”

“Only  on  the  way  to lunch” I admitted; “and look, shall I come over to the flat?”

“Do. I’ll  be there  in  20 minutes.”



Yuan Ming greeted me when I arrived. She looked pleased; but I could sense her fatigue.

“Is  all  well with your deal, Yuan Ming; and I hope you don’t have to  travel  to China - right?”

“Right; the deal is all set and everything is fine.”

“Thank goodness.”



Despite my relief, a lump was forming in  my  chest  and throat.  In just about twenty four hours, Yuan would  be on her  way  to Heathrow. Shortly thereafter I would be taking my flight to Singapore.  Yuan Ming, to my relief, did not display unhappiness.

“Tell  me about your lunch, Uncle” she asked. “You talked about Arthur Smithies, didn’t you?”

“We  did; but do you really want me  tell  you about it now?”

“Oh,  yes;  I’m  sure Brian Davies – I mean your Sir Osbert – knew a lot about him.”



I  knew  that her  main object was to steer my mind away  from  her  imminent return  to  Los Angeles.  All the same, I went  ahead.  She  listened  without interruption, except an occasional snicker as I related the funnier aspects of my recent encounter.  When I finished, she said with conviction:

“So  your friend Brian –  I mean ‘the Honourable Sir Osbert Davies’ – was  not altogether surprised to hear about the hidden rooms? He took what you told him in his stride and came up with a ready explanation.”

“Do you think he is right?”

“Offhand,  and bearing in mind Arthur Smithies’ real background, his view  is plausible.”

“It probably is,” I said, trying to keep my doubts out of my voice.



Neither of us felt inclined to go on talking.  Outwardly, we tried to prolong the discussion  of my meeting with Brian Davies and of Arthur Smithies’ mystery. These were the topics of the day. Our thoughts, though, were focusing on our imminent parting. Some six or perhaps even eight months would pass before we met again; and life – alas – was full of uncertainties. We appreciated that an eventual  return to our respective bases was unavoidable. Yuan Ming had her art and exhibitions; I had my post at the University. But was there no way to extend our spell of harmony and happiness?



Then, through the clouds of gloom, I caught sight of the benign face of my late friend, Yuan Ming’s father, the antiques dealer Tay Fang-Shou. In one of our last conversations, he had urged me not to ignore my insights. People like us taught ourselves to be guided by reason. In the process, we lost the ability to act on instincts, although these alone were dictated by the inner self. Man, Tay had explained in our special jargon, was made of flesh and blood. Reason was an acquired dimension. In extreme occasions – when special circumstances made their demands – you had to free yourself of it.



“Yuan Ming,” I told her when I was certain the time was right; “Yuan Ming: tomorrow I shall fly with you to LA. I know I’ve got to return to Singapore when the academic term stArt; I know you have to decided to settle in LA; and so you should. But I do want to see your exhibition!”



Slowly a smile crept over her face. “Do you have a visa, Uncle; and can you spare the time?”

“The old visa is still valid; and, yes, I have the time.”

“When does your next teaching session begin?”

“Not until the first week of July!”

“And how about your consultancy?”

“I cleared my table before I went to London; and any new matter can wait.”

"But what will you do when my exhibition is on? You can’t be there all the time; and I can’t bear the thought of your sitting around doing nothing.”

“I’ll  have  a good rest and, if I feel like it, I’ll go to some  matinees  in your  theatres. Also, I’d like to spend some time in your museums. There must be some museums in LA?”

“There are. We even have a museum of Judaica; I haven’t  been to it yet because I thought we’d go together one day. But alright  then: you’ll come with me to LA tomorrow, Uncle; but you must not go to any part  of town unless you check with me first and I tell you it’s safe.”

“So it’s all settled,” I let my delight show. “And it’s sure to be a lovely week, Yuan  Ming.”

“It will be; and you are welcome to my opening and closing sessions.”

“Splendid” I told her; “and can’t I be of any use to you whilst the exhibition is on?”

“You can,” she said after a pause. “You can do some of my packing.”

“I’m not sure I understand.”

“I’ve  really just made up my mind, Uncle. When the exhibition is over, I’ve got to fly to Hong Kong in connection  with the deal.”

“So we can go together” I said eagerly.

“Yes,  Uncle; and after that I’m flying over to Singapore. It’s high time I spend some time  back at home.”  

“So we’ll be able to spend plenty of time together!” I said gleefully.

### 20. The Impenetrable Mask

We had dinner in a Viennese restaurant in Queensway.  Left to myself, I should have spent  the next  morning in the vicinity of the hotel, possibly strolling down  Kensington  Church Street for a browse in the antique shops. Yuan Ming was more adventurous. Pointing out that the sky was clear, with only an occasional friendly white cloud  floating  past, she proposed a trip up the Thames.

It  was a hot May day but a mild breeze, blowing from  the East,   kept  refreshing us on the boat and during our hike  in  Kew  Gardens. The  smile on Yuan Ming’s face told me that, like myself, she felt at the top  of  the world. 



Back at my  hotel, where Yuan Ming and I intended to have our dinner at the Law Firm’s expense,  I discovered that Bill Riggs had set me a cumbersome, even  if  pleasant, task. The settlement agreement had been  executed  without demur  by both companies and, shortly before lunch, was given the effect of  a decree by a much relieved Judge. With the exception of Philip  Whitehead, everybody was smiling. True to form, the two law  firms  found this   an opportune moment for the submission of their accounts.  It was,  accordingly, imperative that my own fee note be ready  before I  left London. 

“Well, Uncle” said Yuan Ming enthusiastically; “let’s do it together.”

She  waited patiently whilst I collected  my  time-sheets and reconciled them with the entries in my diary. Then, as I started  to put  the  fee note together, she checked  my amateurish  calculations.  Soon  it  dawned  on  me  that  she  had  a   vivid recollection of the fine tuning my little Yuan Ming had introduced  long ago – in Singapore –  into my bookkeeping and bills. Now and then, she  rounded up taxi fares and restaurant  bills  so  as  to include the tips  and  corrected  all  my  wrong additions  with  an amused grin. The only time she got  incensed  was  when  I sought to charge a nominal fee for the period we had spent on the Continent.

“Come on, Uncle,” she said firmly. “You used to tell ‘her’  that it was customary to charge a waiting-fee of 50% for days a lawyer had made himself available but was not called upon to act.”

“True”  I said; “but we had such a marvellous time during these days.  Do  you really think I ought to charge a waiting-fee?”

“But if we had remained in London they would have had to settle the hotel bill and reimburse your running expenses?”

“I suppose so,” I conceded.

“So,  if  your  conscience bugs you, why don’t you charge them  33% instead of 50% per day?”

“Fair enough,” I accepted her verdict.



When the fee note, neatly typed out in the hotel’s Business Centre, had been sent out, we had coffee in the hotel’s lounge . For a while we talked about our European trip and planned a trip through the United States. In due course, though, the conversation turned back to Arthur Smithies. We had no doubt that his craving for independence – verging on an obsession – was the main reason for his decision to remain unattached.

“But, in truth, our answer begs the question,” Yuan Ming told me.   “If  a man really loves a woman, he’ll go ahead in any event; and he’ll usually be glad to fall in with her wishes and will accept her plans. And, frequently, she’ll accept his. This is not a loss of independence. It is the willingness to compromise necessitated where the spouse’s happiness is the first  priority.”

“How very true,” I told her. “It means that  each  party  to a happy marriage – a  fellowship – has  to give up some independence.  If  one party insists on having his or her way all the time, the  fellowship is  bound to turn sour. I am sure a man as sensitive and as sophisticated as Arthur Smithies knew this; he wasn’t blind.”

“But suppose he  had  another impediment that compounded the first?”

“Such as?”



She was about to tell me but, mercurially, changed her mind. “Uncle,” she said, “let me give you a clue; we’ll see if you find out on your own.”

“ ‘She’ loved to set me riddles,” I grinned. “So even a young lady doesn’t change her spots? Well, go ahead then.”

“Let’s start with Dad,” she said. “How many faces did he have?”

“I  knew  two:  Tay  Fang-Shou’s and Dr  Alfred  Cheng’s:  two  very  different countenances. And, yes, I observed him once leaving the Odeon Cinema with  ‘her’ and your Mom. His mannerism was so different that, for a while, I couldn’t be certain it was him.”

“I’m not surprised. On all family occasions he turned himself into a Chinese family man.”

“But what has this got to do with Arthur Smithies?”

“Not  so  fast, Uncle. How about you? Are you the same with close friends like me, with students, with clients and on formal occasions?”

“Not really,” I consented, still bewildered.

“And  how about your friend Brian? In this morning’s  meeting he was the  Hon. Sir  Osbert  Davies, blah, blah blah; with you he became,  once  again,  Brian; and I won’t  be surprised to see our fat Sir Osbert, dressed informally at home, hopping on all fours and braying like a horse, with the two grandchildren riding on his back and shrieking happily! And to the them  he is neither  Sir  Osbert  nor Brian  Davies: he is Grampa. I’m sure he  loves it, but - what  is more important -  he doesn’t worry about his appearance, or about his ‘mask’!”

“True,” I said “but I still don’t see...”

“So the penny has dropped” she said, taking in the change in my expression  as I cut myself short.

“You  are hinting that Arthur Smithies was never  seen  with his mask off?” I asked.

“More  accurately, Uncle: Arthur Smithies was unable to open up and  drop  his ‘mask’. It had become part of him!”

“And  that  is not something a woman would tolerate in her man – not  if  she loves him?”

“Precisely, Uncle. A woman cannot love a man who, even when they are on their own, remains the very person he is in the boardroom.”

“But suppose he doesn’t have another ‘face’ or ‘alter ego?”

“I don’t know if there are such men,” she said solemnly. “But even if there are some around, Arthur Smithies wasn’t one of them.”

“How do you know?”

“When  Alan  Jones and you looked at the trophies cabinet I  peeked  into  the wardrobe. What I saw was a give away! His neat business suits were hanging  on one  side.  On  the other I saw an old V neck pullover, with  the  elbows  all frayed, an old comfortable jacket, a few pairs  of corduroy trousers and a worn out track suit.  And, Uncle, the cuffs of some of the trouser legs were covered with dry mud.”

“So he did some gardening,” I said thoughtfully. “I should have never guessed!”

“And,  Uncle,  when  you  went through  his  professional  books, I took in   the  other shelves.  Well,  he  had  quite  a  collection  of  books  on  gardening   and horticulture  as well as ‘Teach yourself’ and ‘Do it Yourself’ books  on  such diverse  topics  as  ‘French  Cuisine’ and ‘Carve Your  Own  Clock  Cases  and Mantelpieces’.”

“So  he  was  a  man of many hobbies; and, perhaps, he  had  a  well  equipped workshop, hidden away in another part of the house. What is so strange is that he never mentioned these hobbies or occupations to anybody!”

“Just  as  he didn’t talk about his prints,”  she  agreed. “Outside his own ‘hidden rooms’ he remained –  day in and day out – the ...”

“...  London banker in the neatly cut and carefully pressed business  suit,”  I concluded for her.   

“Precisely;  and he took off his mask only when he was alone, usually  in  his suite, the existence of which was known only to the servants.”

“The  ‘hidden  rooms’, in which he created   a  world  of his own: a sanctuary  not  to  be  disrupted  by any other person.”

“Well put, Uncle; so now you are with me.”

“All  the way,” I confirmed; “but I should still like to know what gave  Arthur Smithies  the strength to reject Vivian Armstrong and give marriage a miss. He was, after all, a normal young man, with a deep affection for her?”

“He  was  a realist, Uncle. He must have appreciated that, to  enjoy  a  happy marriage, he had to change his outlook and his approach to life but felt  both unable and unwilling to do so.”

“What a pity,” I said sadly.

“No, I don’t agree with you there, Uncle! Happy marriages are rare: you know this. And   nobody can tell if Arthur Smithies and Vivian  Armstrong  would have hit it off, even if he had opened up to her.”

“How very true.”

“So perhaps Arthur Smithies made the right decision. He may not have been  the happiest of men; but we know he took life as it came and was ‘satisfied with his lot’.”

“You  are  right,” I admitted. “But  tell me just one more thing: did Arthur  Smithies  appreciate that he was ‘the man with impenetrable mask’?”

“I can’t tell; we may never know,” she conceded.

“And we may not find out  why  he became like that. Maybe it had something to do with his background or home or, maybe,  he  was  ragged so badly in his public school that  he  had  to  teach himself to button up.”

“Or  it might have been – as you would normally preach, Uncle – the outcome  of  pure chance!”

### 21. The Prints

Yuan Ming returned to Chelsea after dinner. Back in my room, I packed my suitcase, intending to check out in the morning. I was going to spend the day with her in Chelsea. In the afternoon we would take a taxi  to Heathrow.

When I had finished packing, I watched two programmes on BBC. Then, before I retired, my mind strayed once again back to Arthur Smithies. We had found the answers to most of our questions about him. Just one issue remained obscure. Why had he been so secretive about his hobby of collecting prints. There was nothing untoward – let alone shameful – about them. Each was a collectors’ item, bound to fetch a substantial  price in an established auction house.



In an attempt to find the answer, I let my mind dwell on the prints in the ‘hidden rooms’. Unlike the colourful painting in the public section of the house, most prints  were black and white; there were only two colour lithographs. Yet another feature was that  the prints highlighted man’s gruesome, untoward, weak and dark side. They also emphasised his blindness and limitations. They were parodies of human nature.



Was it possible that the Late Sir Arthur did not want anyone to suspect that, behind his benign and imperturbable mask, he was deeply interested in and even moved by human frailties? But, if this was the case, Sir Arthur Smithies’ mask was emblematic of an escape. He was not prepared to give anyone the opportunity to peep through it; and the knowledge of the very existence of the prints might have provided a clue. So it was best to keep it in the dark.



Was my analysis sound? Unable to come up with a definite answer, I switched off the lights. I wanted to have a good night’s rest prior to the long flight to Los Angeles. Youth was far behind; and an ageing man had to preserve his energies.
