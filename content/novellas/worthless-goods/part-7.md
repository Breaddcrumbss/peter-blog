Shortly after my discovery of Seddon’s identity, I took the train  to London. My main object was to get Dennis Gray’s comments on two further draft chapters of my thesis. In addition, I wanted to have his reaction to the truth about Seddon.

Dennis Gray gave me a list of detailed comments about my thesis. When he finished, I referred to the Seddon case. He listened attentively to my narration but, all in all, took the story in his stride.

“Were you surprised that Seddon was none other than Jack the publican?”

“I was, rather. My image of Albert Seddon, the manipulative con man, is miles apart from my respect and affection for Jack. He has been good to me.”

“But, Mr. Berger, how much did you really know about Albert Seddon, the somewhat shady character?”

“Only what I gleaned from the case and, in addition, what Jack has told me.”

“And, initially, you couldn’t associate that manipulator with the publican. I understand. But then, are the two incompatible? Are they necessarily two separate persons?”

“Obviously, they aren’t. We are talking about one and the same man but in very different roles. But aren’t the roles inconsistent?”

“Not if you place each in its own context.”

I looked at him intently. Actually, my knowledge of Dennis Gray’s life outside the city was scanty. I knew he was married and that his two sons were cadets in the foreign trade departments of two leading banks. He had also mentioned that his older daughter had set the date of her wedding. All the same, I had no idea of Dennis Gray’s life at home and as a family man. For instance, was he a handy man? What were his favourite sports? Did he like to watch old films?

“Most of us position people where we first meet them. To you, I am Dennis Gray, the London banker. Things got complex in your relationship with Seddon. You thought you knew all about a … shady character known as Seddon. At the very same time, you enjoyed your friendship with Jack, the publican. You had a shock, when the two turned out to be one and the same person. But, you know, Seddon and I may come from similar backgrounds.  We simply opted for very different routes.”

“Similar backgrounds?”

“Quite possible. The British class structure is not easily comprehended by foreigners.”

“I understand,” I had to concede. “Still, the same holds true in other places. The well-dressed man standing next to you in the tram in Vienna may be an actor, a banker, any type of businessman or, possibly, an experienced con man or a serial killer. Occasionally, we can identify his background when he opens his mouth but, then, people often learn to disguise their accent.”

“You could have said the same thing about any passenger in our underground. So, the British are not unique,” grinned Dennis Gray.
