“Well Eli,” said Boaz after a short lull. “This is a good a time to bring up  a point I wanted to raise with you for a while. As you say:  Keren’s  firm isn’t paradise; ditto for Israel Silver’s outfit. Why don’t we  make ourselves independent?”

“Start  a  new practice? There  are some two hundred law firms  in  Tel Aviv?”

“Even  so,  don’t  you think we can make it? We had good  training;  and  we’ve worked well together as a team in law school!”

“But how about ...”

“I’m  pretty sure Rachel Zeitlin will approve. I’ve dropped a hint her  way  a few days ago, and she told me to talk to you first. And I have already identified a good documentation lawyer. We’ll need one. Well,  are you interested?”

“Subject to a chat with Rachel. But from what you say, I’m  pretty sure  she’ll  agree.” 

“So  let’s  agree  in principle,” said Boaz with satisfaction.  “There  is,  of course, no hurry. At this stage, we still have a lot learn from the grand  old men.  Still,  in  a year or perhaps in two we’ll be  ready. And  there’ll  be nothing to stop us!”

“Precisely,” I said and shook his outstretched hand.



For  a  few minutes, both of us were lost in our  thoughts.  Eventually, Boaz broke the silence: “I’ll have to make a move now. And it’s really high time you come over to our place again. Oh yes, and do bring Rachel with you. Miri is dying to meet  your girl friend.”

“We’ll come over early next week.”

“See  you  then. Do give us a ring: Miri is  sure  to  prepare  something special to impress Rachel. See you soon.”



Looking  around  me after Boaz had left, I realised there was no other patron in the establishment. I was about to leave when David  Mizrachi  came over with two steaming mugs of coffee.

“Please, Mr Eli, I need your advice.”

“How can I help you, David,” I said when he joined the table and placed one mug in  front of me.

David Mizrachi curled his long sideburns nervously  with  his right hand. “You  see, Mr Eli, Sarah and I have a big plan. We  make  a little bit of money here; good money. Two years ago I bought the  whole building.”

“You are a capitalist, David,” I said amused.

“I’m not sure what you mean, Mr. Eli. But you see, now it is our house. So, Mr. Eli, we want to make this a large restaurant, with nice tables, colourful tablecloth, and good chairs. You know what I mean?”

“But  David,” I let my concern show, “you’ll have to raise your  prices and  then  many of us will have to go to some other place. And  this  will  be sad.”

“No, Mr. Eli, the prices will be the same. We want our guests to be happy. And in a bigger place we will have more guests; so, no need to raise prices. We’ll make less from one meal but more because we serve more!”

“Good  financial planning. You, David, should have been a banker!”

“Too complicated, Mr. Eli. For us the restaurant is good enough. But now,  Mr. Eli, here is my problem: we want to give our new restaurant a grand name – a name with quality!”

“What sort of name are you looking for, David?”

“I want lawyers to come to our place. The  name must  make them feel at home, Mr. Eli.”

“That’s simple, David. Why not call it: ‘The Lucky Lawyers Haven’?”

“Why ‘Luck’ and ‘Haven?” wondered David.

“Because lawyers know success depends on luck. And a ‘haven’ is  where they hide to get away from pressure at work!”

“Thanks Mr. Eli. Sarah and I will think it over. Would you like another coffee, or perhaps a Humus? It’s on  the house.”

“Thanks,  David. But it’s getting late, and I  have  to pick up Miss Zeitlin. We go to  Habimah this evening.”

“Have a good time then, Mr. Eli, and come again soon,” said David warmly.



Outside it was drizzling. Shrugging my shoulders in resignation, I pulled up the collar of my raincoat. I was on my  way  to meet Rachel: neither the rain nor the cold wind wiped  an  inward looking smile – a smile of anticipation – off my face.
