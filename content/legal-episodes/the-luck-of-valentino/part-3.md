Hannah  spent  two weeks in the dental laboratory  of  an  old acquaintance.  In due course,  Kadmon’s secretary  handed  me the documents received in  respect  of  Omri  Tal’s claim . To my delight, Boaz Tamir had stepped into my trap. The verbose documents served on us had been prepared with a view  to confusing  Kadmon. They failed to state a plain ‘case’ as was appropriate for  a  skirmish  with  down to earth protagonists  like  Hannah  and  me.  Suppressing a malicious grin, I retired to my office to prepare our response.

The main object of the Rules of Court was to achieve clarity in pleadings and  to combat surprises and sharp practices. To this end, the plaintiff had to file a ‘Statement of Claim’, setting out the facts of his case, the formal  ground  on which he based his claim (known as the ‘cause of action’) and his ‘prayer’ or, in  other words, the remedy for which he applied. The defendant, in turn,  was expected to file an equally clear and detailed ‘Defence’.

Both documents had  to spell out full details respecting each point. If, for instance, the victim  of a  running  down case averred that the driver had been negligent,  he  had  to provide  particulars of the negligence alleged by him. If, in his Defence, the driver claimed that the victim had been equally careless, he, too, had  to furnish full details.

If either party’s pleadings failed to meet the mark, the other party was entitled to demand ‘Further and Better Particulars’. The ostensible object of such  an  application was to force the evasive party to show his hand and to nail him down.  In real life, though, such applications were often utilised  as a  delaying  tactic. In theory, a case could be set down for its  hearing  as early  as  thirty days following the last exchange of pleadings.  That stage, however,  was not reached until all relevant particulars and details had  been provided.  A request for further particulars could readily buy the  applicant  six weeks  of  grace and, if his opponent decided to respond by filing a similar application of his own, the trial would, usually, be delayed by at least three or even four months.

Boaz’s Statement of Claim left the door wide open for such manoeuvres. In one clause, for instance, he asserted that Solomon Vered had driven his  truck in  a “reckless manner devoid of any consideration for the safety of others”. Utilising the strict Rules of Court, I asked, first, for details of  Solomon’s alleged  recklessness and, secondly, demanded to know what measures of safety he should have observed “in consideration of the safety of others”. In another clause, Boaz averred that Solomon had undertaken his last trip for the day in “blatant defiance of the elementary guidelines on driving shifts”. Seeking  to get matters straight, I asked ‘my Learned Friend’ to cite the guidelines in point. Boaz, who  had  anticipated that his high flying rhetoric would drive Abraham Kadmon to a quick and favourable  settlement,  was  going grind his teeth when  he  encountered  our dispassionate reaction.

It  took  me two days to draft my Application for  Further  and  Better Particulars.  The  end  product comprised 120 queries. I then drafted our Defence,  leaving Boaz ample opportunity to demand further particulars on  our contentions  respecting Omri Tal’s own carelessness, technically described  as ‘contributory  negligence’.  Boaz was certain to bite and, in this  way,  make room  for  another  six  or  seven weeks  of  delay. Once these  skirmishes  were  over,  the  courts  would  be  getting  ready  for  their summer recess. The case would, obviously,  have to  be set down for trial in the next session.

As  was  common  in those days, my initial  drafts  had  been  illegible scribbles. My immediate task was to transform them for submission. In an era in which word-processors were still the subject of science fiction  and in  which  only senior executives were equipped with dictating  machines,  the exercise required skill, patience and stamina. My first step was to transcribe my  untidy  notes  into neat pages written in as clear a handwriting  as  I  could command. It took one of our secretaries three days to type them.

Two  days  after  Hannah returned to the office from her  spell  in  the dental laboratory, we had our strategy meeting with Jacob Keren. Having regard to the nature of case, there was no need for the ceremony. Hannah was  an  experienced court room gladiator, and I could be trusted  to  lay  the legal  foundations soundly and carefully. Keren, though, reserved  to  himself the right to say the last word in every matter. His philosophy on this point was, in the ultimate, commendable: he was the head and sole proprietor of Jacob Keren & Associates.  A blemish on its record was bound to stain his own  impeccable record. He was not prepared to take such a risk!

Snug in his opulent leather chair by the huge, neatly kept, desk,  Jacob Keren’s sharp eyes watched the two of us keenly.

“Excellent detective work, Hannah.  Our Omri Tal doesn’t have to stand when  he’s  at work.  He can sit down and still function efficiently.  What a stroke of  good luck to find out that three excellent dental technicians in Tel Aviv do  their work from a wheelchair!”

“Still, his new work technique will slow him down for  a while,” Hannah commented judiciously.

“For a year?”

“A  year or two. He’ll get used to the new pattern of work gradually.  Sachs was working again at full speed two years after his spinal injury.”

“And what do you say about the liability?” Keren asked me.

“I  still think it’s about fifty-fifty. Omri could have got a new battery  for his  torch  before he rode to the club. There are three hardware shops  on  the way.  But  Vered could have taken the well lit road instead of  the  dark  and narrow lane; and he knew he was tired!”

“We’ll settle on 50-50 liability for his loss of future earnings.  The problem is our Valentino’s loss of enjoyment of life: his dancing career has come to an abrupt end! That’s our Achilles heel!”

“Surely, we’ll  tell him to concentrate on his second hobby – you  must  have seen Ratosh’s note?” said Hannah.

“I  have,” grunted Keren. “And you did the right thing when you followed up the trail. But do you think the information is helpful?”

“Why  not?” Hannah tried to sound adamant. “Ratosh says Omri Tal  played  fifth and  fourth  board  in tournaments of the Emanuel Lasker  Club.  I’ll  try  to convince our Omri, in cross, that with extra time at hand he can end up as  first board!”

“What do you think, Eli? You play chess. Well, what are Omri’s chances? Ratosh says Omri is good at openings but  freaks out in the middle game. What do you make of this?”

“Excellent  memory but poor strategy and initiative. Not  the type of chap who rises to first or even second board.”

“So,  his prospects at chess are nothing like his  record as an amateur dancer!” Keren summed up.

“Perhaps. But you didn’t think too much of his prospects as a dancer in our first meeting,” said Hannah. “What made you change your mind?”

“The Registrar has assigned the case to Ehood Morag!”

“What a rotten piece of luck,” said Hannah. “So, we start with a  handicap!”

“A two barrelled handicap,” muttered Keren, adding pointedly: “and I gather that you, Eli, aren’t –  in a manner of speaking – one of Morag’s favourites!”

“True,” I admitted.

“I’m told he snaps at you?”

“He does sometimes!”

“Well,  Eli”  said Keren, his eyes fixed on a point over my shoulder,  “a  good general knows how to profit from a tactical disadvantage.”

“I understand,” I affirmed, taking note of Hannah’s sympathetic glance.

“Then see what you can come up with when he hears this application. You are to handle it.  It’s time you leave your mark!”

“Oh, very well, then,” I said with resignation.

Keren smiled malevolently: “Good; but now Hannah and I must turn to another matter.  You’ll excuse us!”
