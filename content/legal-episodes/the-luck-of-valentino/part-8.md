When Boaz returned to work, winter was just around the corner. Our  pre-trial  hearing with  Baruch Shoham took place on a wet and chilly day.    Unlike  the sparkling  conference table in Morag’s ante chamber, Shoham’s plain table  was covered  with  books,   untidily strewn files and proofs  of  articles  to  be published  in  The  Advocate, which he edited for our  Law  Society.  As  we entered, he raised his eyes from the document in front of him and beckoned us to sit down.

“I'm  glad  you are well again, Mr. Tamir,” he said warmly.  “I  was  extremely sorry to hear about your ailment. Hepatitis is a nasty thing!”

“It is indeed, Judge,” affirmed Boaz.

“My wife had it shortly after we fled from Germany. She was down for some eight weeks! I hope medicine has made some progress since then!”

“I  suppose it has. But, even so, it took me seven weeks  to  get over it!”

“Still, all’s well that ends well. I hope you  will stick to  the  diet prescribed by your doctor. We must never take chances  with  our health! You do agree, don’t you?”

“Of course,” said Boaz, smiling gratefully.



During  this  brief exchange, and the next few minutes in  which  Shoham gathered  his  thoughts as he leafed through the file, my  eyes  moved  keenly between  the two men. Boaz would have resented the very same sentiments if expressed  by  another person in authority, such a Ehood Morag.    Inwardly, he would have dubbed the speaker a patronising ass.  The  warm smile which had crept over his face when he answered Shoham, convinced me that no such thought had crossed his mind on this occasion.

Grinning to myself, I concluded that, like many Yekkes, Baruch Shoham had a way with people. Despite his beaked nose, inordinately long ears, bald  head and  nondescript countenance, he was liked and respected by everyone who worked with him. His associate doted on him and his secretary stayed  behind for  long  hours  to finish her work without expecting overtime  pay. Most  lawyers in Tel Aviv were delighted  when their  cases  were set down before him. I recalled with amusement how, at the end one of his customary tirades  against the ‘bloody Yekkes’, Keren added:  “thank  goodness there  are some exceptions, like Baruch Shoham.”

In more than one way, this general esteem was surprising. To start  with, Baruch Shoham was a stickler to the rules. Unlike  other  judges, who  would  occasionally use shortcuts in order to expedite  hearings,  Shoham believed  in  leaving  no  procedural  or  substantive   issue   unresolved. Occasionally,  this  was both unnecessary and pedantic.  His  pleasant  manner alone saved him from critical comments.

The  other handicap that Baruch Shoham had to overcome in order to  gain the  respect  of  the  young but vigorous Israeli Bar  related  to  his  legal background.  Shortly after the end of the First World War,  Markus Edelstein – as he was  then known – studied law and economics in Heidelberg. After two years  in Berlin, he moved to Darmstadt and started to practise on his own. His business  flourished  but,  reading  the writing on the wall, he sold out  in  1936  and migrated  to  Palestine. After years of pupillage and studies,  he  was called  to  the  local Bar. By then he had acquired a sound,  even  if  rather basic, understanding of  the English common law which  had been engrafted onto the Turkish Law of Palestine. The general consensus was that, notwithstanding his alien credentials,  Baruch Shoham  functioned efficiently in  this  complex legal  environment. At heart, though, he remained a civilian lawyer.  In his own words: “Policy must emerge from general  principles. To ascertain it from an amorphous mass of rigidly  construed decisions and piecemeal determinations is unscientific and unsound!”

Ordinarily, such pronouncements would have antagonised the luminaries of the  local  profession,  most of whom had qualified after studies for the English Bar qualification. What saved Baruch Shoham from their censure was his  masterful  handling of all cases tried by him. Even  where  matters  were complex  and  the subject of conflicting evidence, his analysis of  the  facts remained  superb.  No detail in any document, deposition, expert’s  report  or testimony  escaped  his attention. And his ability to get to the heart  of  the matter was phenomenal. It was, generally, thought that this flair  made up for certain  shortcomings in his analysis of fine points of law.



When Shoham raised his eyes from the Omri Tal file, he smiled warmly  at both of us. “I don’t think you left any point uncovered, Gentlemen. And I am relieved  to note that the parties have agreed on a fifty-fifty apportionment of  liability.  We’ll save at least one morning this way. But may I  make  one suggestion?”

“Please, Judge” said Boaz.

“Well,  both of you have been meticulous in  asking  for and providing ‘further particulars’. I am, of course,  all  in favour:  the issues have crystallises and we’ll have no surprises  during  the trial. But I think it would be for the best if all the additional details were incorporated in a single of amended pleadings. This way we shall not have to rove from document to document as we go. What do you say?”

“The thought has crossed our minds,” Boaz volunteered. “We were going to raise it with you.”

“Splendid. Will two weeks do? You can always come back  to me if you are unable to meet the deadline.”

“What do you think, Eli” asked Boaz.

“It’s fine with me.”

“Good,” said Shoham. “The next point I want to raise concerns the  reports  of the  two  orthopaedic  surgeons. Both conclude that the  plaintiff’s  progress ought to be monitored. Although the ‘extent of the injury’ is determined as at the time of the accident, the reports confirm that, in our case, the extent of the  injuries  sustained can be assessed only after a review  of  the  healing process, which varies from person to person. Well, what do you say?”

“Again, Judge, Eli and I are of the same view.  But we have  a practical  problem.  The two surgeons who provided the reports are no  longer available.  Ours  migrated to Canada and Rotem’s man retired  for reasons of health. We are trying to find another surgeon, acceptable to both parties. But the three we’ve approached turned us down flat!”

“Have you tried Dr. Alon Shaked?”

“He was our first choice,” said Boaz.

“His receptionist was rather curt!” I grumbled.

“We  may  get  a different response if I ask Alon Shaked to  act  as  ‘Court’s Expert’. This way he’ll be cross examined only if his report gives rise  to controversy. Well, shall I ask my associate to approach him?”

Boaz was supportive. “Please  do, Judge. Do  you  think  it might, perhaps, be possible to prevail on  Dr.  Shaked  to submit his report in eight copies?”

“That,”  said Shoham sadly, “might be the last straw! I suspect  many  surgeons and  physicians  refuse to assist us because they hate to get their reports typed, proof read and retyped. But I have another suggestion. A few days ago a new  photographic  shop  opened up  in Herzl Street. They use  a  very  modern method.  You  can  get  any number of prints within 24  hours.  The  price  is somewhat  higher than we are used to but, then, you have to pay for  progress. Do you think this will do?”

“I’m sure it will,” I stepped in. “If, perhaps, your associate could ring me  when you get the report, I’ll take it to the shop. I’m sure our  clients will  be prepared to defray the expenses subject to the order of costs  to  be made subsequently.”

“That’s fine with me,” agreed Boaz gratefully.

“Splendid. And, Gentlemen, you will be interested to know that, before long, problems concerning the  production of  copies  of  documents will become a thing of the past!  Copies will be produced readily on the premises of every law office  and commercial firm!”

“How?” I wanted to know.

“According  to  an American magazine, a new photographic  technology  will  be announced soon. It will enable us to make a copy of a typed or written page by feeding it through the ‘camera’, without  first producing a  ‘negative’. The entire procedure will take less than 10 seconds per page!”

“It will revolutionise office practice!” said I.

“It  will. But its introduction will also trigger  fresh work  for law offices!”

“Why?”

“At present you hand your judge a ‘List of Authorities’ just  before the trial begins. He has to read them in the library or get his long-suffering associate to haul the books to his Chambers. How long will  it take  before judges demand that law offices ‘reproduce’ all the authorities cited?”

“True,” agreed Boaz. “But that manual work can be done by a secretary!”

“Quite  so,” nodded Shoham. “But her boss will have to check that  nothing  has been left out! But, now, we must turn back to the matter presently before us. Mr. Berger, I understand Frau Hod is  no longer with your firm. Are you going to represent Rotem at the trial?”

“Not  on this occasion, Judge. Mr. Keren has asked Hannah Hod to carry on  with  this case.  But  I do hope I shall have the pleasure of appearing  before  you,  in Court, on some future occasion.”

“The pleasure will be mine,” smiled Shoham. “And I shall, of course, be pleased to see Frau Hod in Court this time. So can we perhaps fix the date?”

“I  hope it can be heard soon after we have Dr. Shaked’s report,  Judge,”  said Boaz.  “My  client proposes to move to Be'er Sheva as soon as the  hearing  is finished.”

“Well,  we sure ought to try to accommodate him. Will  a  date early in March be suitable? If the plaintiff sees Alon Shaked next week, we’ll receive the report before the end of this month.”

“The first week of March is fine for us,” said Boaz.

“I’ll have to check with Hannah Hod. But, as far as I know, she has no other trial at that time. May I suggest we pencil the dates in, subject  to my confirming with her?”

“Excellent. So  we are  all set.
