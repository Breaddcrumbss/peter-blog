A  few  days passed before I managed to track Hannah down. After weeks of a major  courtroom battle, she took one week of leave. When she  reappeared,  I  stared at her with concern. Once again she  had  lost  weight, looked worn out and a dry cough and persistent wheeze marred her speech.

“You need a real break, Hannah. “And you  ought to spend a few days in Eilat. A change of climate can do wonders.”

“Next week I’m taking Tali to Tiberias. I’ll be away for two or three weeks.”

“Give me a tinkle  if you need anything,” I offered.

“I  shan’t need a thing. I’m going to leave the office behind!”

“Good on you!” I approbated. “In the words of Goethe: ‘it [the office]  can lick… ”.

“Now, now, Eli,” Hannah burst into a fit laughter interrupted by a cough,  “poetic licence is prohibited in all respectable law firms! And  we better  spend  a few minutes on the Omri Tal case. I read your  memo.  So  you think Morag will do?”

“I’m positive.”

“Very well then. And, Eli, I’m glad you didn’t follow up Jacob Keren’s hint. I wanted  to  warn you off but got too entangled in my recent case.  I didn’t have the chance to talk to you.”

“Still, don’t we have to go back to Keren?”

“No! We won’t!  I'll take the responsibility! And, Eli, for all  practical purposes you are in charge. As soon as I’m back, Jacob Keren and I have to get ready for the next phase of our major case.”

“What if Keren raises the Omri Tal matter with me when you are away?”

“He won’t. Malka is taking him for a holiday in Cyprus. They leave  tomorrow. And if he feels up to it, she proposes to book a cruise to the Greek  Islands. He, too, will  be away for a few weeks.”

“Is  Keren  in  a bad way?” I asked. “I thought he took  court  cases  in  his stride.”

“He  isn’t  getting younger! And this is a particularly  tricky matter.” 

“Well, Hannah: don’t let him drag you into cases like that.”

“Actually, Eli, I’m going to do better than that!”

“How?”

“I’m quitting!”

“Quitting?"”

“Yes, Eli. I can’t go on like this! And it’s not just my health!”

“What else?”

“The other day I came home just before midnight. Tali was all worked up. She wanted to know if I had an affair with Jacob Keren!”

“I hope you gave her a good hiding!”

“No,  Eli. That would have been counter-productive. I simply told her what Keren and I had been working on – step by step. Before long she broke into tears, hugged me and said she’d  quit school and get a job so that I could have a decent rest. And she warmed up the dinner she had made for us and insisted I eat; and it was delicious!”

“But what has all this got to do with your job here?”

“A  teenaged girl like Tali needs her mother. I’ve neglected her long  enough! As things stand, I’m never at home before 8.00 p.m. It ain’t right!”

“But do you have another job?”

“As a matter of fact, I do. Rotem is setting up a Legal Department. It’ll take charge of lending contracts, mortgage registrations, debt collections and  run of  the  mill  litigation.  Ruth Schwartz offered me  the  job.  It’s  not  as glamorous  as doing big cases with Keren. But the salary is O.K.; and  it’s  a 9.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m. desk job: just what I want. And Keren can look for some other aspiring lawyer to take my place! I’m tired of the limelight!”

“I can see your point, Hannah. I only hope I shan’t  be Keren’s next victim!”

Hannah broke into a smile. “You need not  fear. Keren  knows your strength is working out complex legal points. He prefers to work with somebody who is strong on facts and practicalities.”

“That leaves me out.”

“It does. So don’t worry!”

“Well, how about the Omri Tal case? Keren won’t let me handle a full trial for at least another year or two.  Will you be able to appear?”

“I think so. Rotem expects me to take up court cases from time to time. So even if  the case is heard after I leave, I’ll be able to take it on by arrangement.”
