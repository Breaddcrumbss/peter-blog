During  the  following  weeks, Boaz and  I  kept  exchanging  procedural broadsides.  Each clever move cancelled out another, which meant that we produced more heat than light. The  proceedings,  though,  did  not disrupt our friendship. During the very same period, I came over regularly  to the  Tamirs’ residence, usually bringing with me a bottle of wine or, as was  the custom in Israel, fresh fruit for their table. Invariably, we had  a pleasant time, playing after dinner a game of Monopoly, listening to music, or discussing fervently some political events or newly published books. The  only subject we stayed clear off  was the Omri Tal trial.

I  recall one evening, when Miri prepared a sumptuous  meal. Noting my apprehensive look, she smiled at me warmly: “No,  Eli, I’m not being extravagant. We have  just  received  a letter  from  America.  My Aunt Lilly passed away a few  weeks  ago. She left us some 35,000 dollars!”

“That’s wonderful,” I said.

“Let’s hope Auntie Lilly’s spirit agrees with  you,”  observed  Boaz  dryly. “Still, we are now able to repay our mortgage in full!”

“But don’t you want to take a trip to Europe or America first?” I asked.

“Sooner or later we shall. We’ll start saving for it straight away. But first I want to tell our bank manager to go jump!”

A few days later the Tamirs went for a fortnight to Kibbutz Yokneam. I, in turn, proceeded to Mount Karmel, then a sparsely populated and unspoiled haven. Leaving the office and my work behind me, I went for long walks in the brisk mountain air which, even during the Mediterranean  summer, retained its cool and dry touch. I returned to Tel Aviv revitalised, ready for the  start of the new Judicial Session.

As I prepared myself for the  hearing before Ehood Morag, I sensed that all procedural antics had  been exhausted. Unfortunately,  a  discreet  report of Joseph Almog,  a  well  known  private investigator,   affirmed  that, up to then, young Omri Tal had not put  in  an appearance in his beloved dancing club. I was raking my brain for a good excuse for a further adjournment,  when I got an unexpected telephone call from Miri Tamir.

“Eli,”  she  said in her direct manner. “Boaz asked me to ring  you  about  the appearance before Judge Morag next Monday.”

“Is anything wrong?”

“Not really. We are all fine, but Boaz was called up for reservist service! He had to leave yesterday!”

“Didn’t they give him some notice?”

“They said they sent him a summons, but we never got it. They probably sent it to the wrong address. When he didn’t respond, they came over to take him!”

“Just like that?” I let my annoyance show.

“Just like that; and they were rude. Still, he’s an officer: so, in the end, they had to behave themselves. But Boaz had to go; and he won’t  be  back for six weeks!”

“What is to be done?”

“Nobody  in  the  office wants to take the case over. Boaz  wants  you  to explain the position to the Judge.”

“It’s  unusual,  Miri. Still, Morag knows both of us  well.  So  I’m pretty sure he’ll understand.”

“That’s what Boaz said,” she replied.

“I’ll  ring  you  as soon as I have appeared  before  Morag.  In  the meantime, please give my best wishes to Boaz.”



Ehood  Morag’s  associate led me to the Judge’s Chambers as  soon  as  I arrived  but,  to my surprise, did not stay put. As I was being heard in the absence of the ‘other party’ this was unusual. Noting  my  surprise,  Morag explained the position readily.

“In view of what I have got to say, we can skip all formalities, Berger.  But, first, how was your break?”

“Good, Judge. I had a pleasant time up Mount Karmel. I love it there.”

“Hopefully, your haven will not be discovered too soon by tourists,” he  said with a smile. Looking at him more closely, I concluded that he, too, had had a relaxing  holiday.  All the same, he did not  appear  particularly  ebullient. Indeed, I had the impression he was ill at ease.

“Boaz  Tamir  asked  me to apologise to you  for  this  irregularity,  Judge. Regrettably, the army did not give him any warning. He was called up suddenly; and he’ll be away for six weeks.”

“I  understand. The army says the safety of  the homeland  constitutes  a  first priority. In their eyes, our timetables are irrelevant. Unfortunately, Tamir’s ‘abduction’ means  that I shan’t be able to hear the case.”

“Why, Sir” I said, correcting myself instantly, “I mean, Judge.”

“The  Frumm Factory explosion case is coming up in five weeks and I have been asked to take it on. I expect it to last at  least four months. Your case should not be in abeyance for such a span.  It would have to be heard by another judge, probably Baruch Shoham. I hope Tamir and you will appear before me in another matter in the future. I like to watch my former students in action.”



Boaz  Tamir, to whom I conveyed the information through Miri, expressed his unequivocal  approval. “Boaz,” Miri informed me,  “says  he prefers Shoham’s common sense to Morag’s brilliant but often fancy  analysis.”

Hannah,  too,  voiced her relief. “I always know where I  stand  with  Shoham. Morag is mercurial! I know he is very clever. But I’d rather have a down to earth judge than  an intellectual giant!”

A few days later Hannah told  me the major  case, handled by Keren and herself,  had been settled. “A sudden breakthrough?” I asked.

“Not really. They could have settled on the same terms from the word go. But all involved had to exhaust themselves before they were prepared to come to the conference table in a mood to compromise!”

“And  the lawyers made a handsome profit. Still, the settlement lets you off the hook earlier than expected.”

“It does. And Keren has already found a suitable replacement.”

“Who?”

“Rachel  Zeitlin. She has ditched her second  husband  and feels Jerusalem is too small a place for the two of them!” 

“So, we’ll have the honour of seeing her in Tel Aviv,” I grunted.

“And  you better watch out,” Hannah confided, maternally. “Rachel is sure to look  for  her number three!”

“You  better  introduce her to Abraham Kadmon. The  poor chap had a bad shock when his wife ran away with that taxi driver. A liaison with a hot shot lawyer like Rachel  will  boost his shaken ego.”

“I’ll do my best,” Hannah giggled. “But I have it on good authority that Rachel is looking for a nice, young and innocent bloke!”

“That leaves me out!” I asserted.

“Glad to have allayed your fears. We better turn our  undivided attention to Omri Tal! I remain on the case. And, Eli, have a look at Almog’s latest report: Valentino is back on the dancing floor but restricts himself to Waltz and Tango.”

“Does  this  help  our cause?” I asked, skimming  through  the document. “The chap was a virtuoso. Some social dancing is neither here nor there!”

“True! But where there’s life there’s hope.  Before long, Omri will  start afresh!”

“But  surely,” I persevered, “there is a difference between social dancing  and Omri Tal’s original aspirations to fame?”

“There  is. But the orthopaedic  surgeons  did  not  rule  out rehabilitation. So, perhaps, we can  demand  a further medical examination?”

“I’ll  raise  the  matter in the pre-trial session. If the case is really assigned to Shoham, we’ll get an order.”

“Very likely. In the meantime, we better keep Omri Tal ‘under observation’. But, Eli, we need time!”

“I'll see what I can do. But I’m running out of gimmicks!”

“Play it by ear, then” she suggested.



In the event, Fortuna smiled on us. Some ten days before Boaz’s discharge from reservist service, Miri called again. “Eli, Boaz asked me to tell you  he needs  a further extension.”

“Don’t tell me they’re keeping him for some extra time?”

“No, that’s not the reason,” her voice shook as spoke.

“What is wrong? I hope nothing happened to him.”

“He is sick, Eli. He’s got hepatitis! He is in hospital.”

“Jaundice?” I asked anxiously. “I’ve never known Boaz to be sick, Miri, except of course a cold or soar throat here and there. What happened?”

“Two  of  his men took him for a meal in Ramleh. You know he loves  Arab food. I suspect the plates had not been properly rinsed.”

“Can I visit him?”

“He’ll be hospitalised for two weeks. You can come over when I bring him home. But  you  better be careful: it’s  very contagious. I’m sending the kids to Yokneam. Mom will look after them until Boaz  recovers.”

“Let  me  know how he is doing and when he is likely to  be  back  at work? The judge may ask.”

“It’ll  take  him  six weeks to recover and he’ll have to rest at home for another two or three weeks.”

“I’ll ask for a two months adjournment.”



Judge  Shoham’s  associate secured  the  required adjournment straight away. During the next  two  months, Hannah kept getting detailed reports from Joseph Almog, our P.I. He  confirmed  that  Omri  and  his  ‘charming  Dahlia’  were  attending  two, occasionally  three,  social dancing sessions in their club each  week.  In later reports, Almog, who had gained Omri’s confidence, confirmed that Omri  was again  keeping  normal  working  hours in his workshop.  Later  still,  Omri  had confided  he was ‘fed up with the stuck up society of Tel Aviv’ and  planned to  move to Be’er Sheva in the Negev. In due course, Omri and Dahlia put down a deposit on a three-bedroom house in a fashionable suburb of their chosen town. They planned to get married as soon as they moved down South. Almog had been invited to attend their engagement party.

“So you  see,  Eli,”  Hannah smirked  with  satisfaction.  “Young  Valentino’s positive outlook on life is standing him in good stead. I bet that as soon  as Mr. & Mrs. Tal settle in Be’er Sheva, they’ll start a dancing club!”



Boaz  took  longer than anticipated to recover. Like most  vigorous  and self assured  men, he was a difficult patient, given  to  petulant  outbursts followed by spells of remorse, melancholy and depression. Their effect on Miri was  devastating.  Occasionally,  I felt more concerned for her  than  for  the invalid she was painstakingly nursing back to health.

In  an attempt to alleviate their burden, I came over to their place  as often as work permitted. Because alcohol and fruit had been proscribed by the doctor,  I  brought Boaz  books,  magazines  and,  from  time  to  time,  reports of new legal decisions.  Boaz was  a  voracious  reader and, over the seven  weeks  he  remained bedridden,  got  immersed in some philosophic tracts as well as in  modern novels.

Reading, though, did not keep Boaz fully occupied. Every now and then he rang up his secretary to get the latest office news and, whenever I turned up, cross-examined me on what was going  on  in our  small  and closely knit legal fraternity. After a while it dawned  on  me that  I was not his only source of information. One evening, for instance,  he asked whether Hannah had already taken up her new post at Rotem.

“She has. We gave her a splendid farewell party. Keren used the occasion to deliver a moving speech!”

“Praising Hannah’s performance?”

“That too. But his main theme was the virtue of steady work and  perseverance.”

“Was  Keren by any chance trying to impress Rachel Zeitlin? I’m told  she  has taken over from Hannah!”

“You do keep your ear to the ground.”

“I am allowed to tap the grapevine – even although drinking is  prohibited for  the  time being. And, Eli, I hope you’ll come to like  Rachel.  She’s exciting and – let me tell you – a nice girl!”

“Nice? How about her two divorces?”

“I’m  not  suggesting she’s suitable for a lasting relationship. She  is  self-centred and can be quite a handful. But an evening with her is fun!”

“I’ll  convey the information to Abraham Kadmon. We are making a  concentrated effort to bring the two lost souls together!”

“Don’t be silly. Kadmon is too old for her. And he is a non-entity. Rachel will have a fit if he dares to ask her out.”

“So why do you wish her Ladyship on poor me?”

“Because you, Eli, must not go on pining for the girl who said ‘no’  to you ages ago!”

“I’ll look around when pressure eases at work!”

“Balderdash. You use every spare moment to dash over to the Philosophic Society. You better take stock of the situation or you’ll  end up a confirmed bachelor with beautiful dreams behind you!”
