Leaving  our  briefcases  in the “robing room”, Boaz  and  I walked  to Nahalat  Benjamin Street. Ignoring Boaz’s covetous glance in the direction of David Mizrachi’s Eatery, I steered a course to the old fashioned  restaurant which served home cooked Jewish  dishes.  Boaz sighed  as  he perused the bill of fares but cheered up when  the  salt  beef, boiled chicken, mashed potatoes and a mixed salad were placed in front of us.

“Today it’s on me, Eli” he said.



For a  while both of us concentrated on the excellent food.  Initially, the peace and quiet surrounding us was  comforting  but, eventually, I found the silence depressing.

“Boaz: what’s the matter. It’s not like you to sit here and brood! Have I offended you somehow?”

“Of course not, Eli. Don’t be silly. The little games we play when we practise law are contests of skill.  But there are certain matters on my mind.”

“I  hope  nothing  is  wrong ...” I started and stopped  dead  in  my  tracks, apprehensive of asking a tactless question.

“No,  Eli,  nothing’s wrong at home,” Boaz hurried to assure me. “Now  that things  are back to normal, Miri is again her good happy self. And – let me tell you – a few days ago Ruthi got a distinction in school for her essay!”

“So maybe one day she’ll outshine Dad!” I grinned.

“Let’s hope she picks on something better than our bloody profession,” answered Boaz, then hastily covered his mouth with his palm.

“So, something’s wrong at work. Care to tell me?”

For a moment Boaz hesitated. “You see,  Eli,  some  two weeks ago, just before I was back at work, they had their quarterly partners’ meeting. Well, they constituted me a salaried partner!”

“Congratulations. That’s excellent news. So what  on  earth  is wrong?”

“They elected Leah Sapir and that fellow Dror Ergass full equity partners! I keep  telling myself  both  have  been  with the firm longer than  me.  But  I  still  can’t understand why they were jumped from associates to full partners in one go!”

“It  is  unfair. Both are average. Dror is also bone lazy! And Leah is useless; in her two years with  Keren, she was nicknamed ‘the mother of all lost cases’!”

“Well,  neither of them has changed for the better over the years.”  Boaz, broke our eye contact and fixed his dejected glance on the plate in front of him. I, in turn, looked at him with understanding.

Boaz’  chagrin and my sympathy might have puzzled  an outsider.  Indeed, to  anybody except a fellow lawyer, Boaz’ new designation would  have  sounded grand.  In reality, though, a ‘salaried partner’ was nothing but a  well  paid associate.  He  had no say in the running of the firm, was not entitled  to  a share in its profits and, unlike an ‘equity partner’, remained an employee. In a  ‘Sole Proprietorship’, such as ‘J. Keren & Associates’, such  an  appointee was known as a ‘Senior Associate’. His pay was higher than a  mere associate’s. But the ‘Sole Proprietor’ remained the one and only boss!

“Surely, Boaz, you’ll be made  an equity partner next year! Still, I don’t understand how Israel Silver could do this to you!”

“He  didn’t, Eli. You must remember that, unlike Jacob Keren, Silver  is  just the Senior or Managing Partner. The younger partners have the power to outvote him.  This  time they did! They argued it would be safer to consider  my  case after  I’d  recovered.  Silver  had to give way but  wrung  out  the  Salaried Partnership and an undertaking that I would be reviewed again next year!”

“Well, at least he fought for you. And I hope he got you a good salary.”

“He did, rather. I’ll get as much as Dror and Leah. And the firm will also pay  me a percentage of my billings. If I pull my weight my ‘take home  package’ will  be fine. But there’ll still be the thorn in the flesh: I can’t  bear  to think these two have been advanced before me.”

“They’ve been with the  firm  much longer than you. It’s not as if they had stolen a march. And perhaps it was their last chance.”

“That what I keep telling myself.  But Dror and Leah trot home by 5.00 p.m. and I stay behind till 9.00 or even 10.30 p.m. I’ve worked my guts out  for  the firm:  and just because I’ve crossed swords with some of these bastards,  they do a dirty on me when I’m ill in bed!”

“You mustn’t let this get you down. If  it does, they’ll have the last laugh!”

“I know. Thanks, Eli.”



Soon  the  waitress cleared the table and brought us  two cups of steaming, strongly  brewed and aromatic coffee. Seeing that Boaz  remained  lost  in  his thoughts, I prompted: “Is there anything else you wanted to tell me?”

“As a matter of fact, there is. When this Omri  Tal  case is over, I want to have a chat with you.  If  there  is  any unexpected  development at work, please take it easy. I have a plan you  might find interesting!”
