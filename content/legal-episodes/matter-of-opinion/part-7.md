Next morning I returned to Singapore. Some six weeks later, Jack sent me a copy of the judgment in favour of the Bank. To my knowledge, Vollar did not appeal.

After a few years, I took a break, traveling to Perth with my wife. We took a pleasant trip up the Swan River. When we embarked at the end station, we decided to have a light lunch. To my utter surprise, the cafeteria was run by the Katzs.

It was a pleasant spot and the standard menu was excellent. When we finished, Rena – who recognised me – came over for a chat.

“You do have a fine  canteen, Rena. I’m glad you brought your ship home,” I told her. “Please tell me what happened.”

“It’s good to see you, Peter. You see, we had luck. After Yuri was discharged, we managed to get a loan from an investor, introduced by Bruce. We pay 5 per cent interest and never ask for a receipt. I think, he does not pay income tax. But this is not my business. And we make good money.”

“I’m really glad, Rena. I started my life as a refugee during the Second World War. I worked hard. And I am sure that so did Yri and you. And, you know, your English has improved!”

“Well, Bruce  teaches me. And he is a good teacher.”
