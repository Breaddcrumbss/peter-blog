I had no wish to remain in the empty courtroom for about three hours or to join the queue of advocates at the cafeteria. To save mother the trouble of preparing a hasty lunch, I got myself a Pitah Falafel – a local delicacy which had lined the pockets of many a surgeon specialising in abdominal ulcer operations – and walked home. In those golden days of youth, a half hour’s walk appeared a trifle.

As I entered, mother looked up from her needle work. As soon I sat down and took off my jacket, she started to question me about the case. She was taken aback when I told her of Morag’s intervention.

“Was this appropriate?” she wanted to know.

“Hard to say. Fischer irked him. But I suspect there was more to it than that.”

“How did Fischer irk Morag?”

“Fischer was plain uncivil to me when I started my very mild cross. Morag is known as a master of his court. He intervened when Fischer stepped out of line. Still, I think there was some other factor. Fischer kept looking over my shoulder when he talked to me. I suspect Morag was given the same treatment. And he did not appreciate it.”

“I think I understand,” conceded mother.



Mother was not surprised when I mentioned Rachel’s outburst.  She knew Rachel disliked Ruth and her entire milieu. All in all, Rachel was a self-made woman. She had no time for the pampered carriers of mid-European culture. She looked down on them.

“Surely, Mamma, she did not ‘look down on me’?”

“She didn’t. I know that. But you Peter’le had never been a cultural snob. Further, you admired Rachel for months before she took you on. I remember how you kept raving about her. On the surface, you admired her courtroom manner. But right from the start there was more to it than that.”

“I know. Still, Mamma, I am out of the woods now. As you know, I am a reasonable man prepared to concede defeat.”

“Thank goodness. Still, Peter’le, Rachel continues to have a soft spot for you. This, in part, explains her outburst. I’m pretty sure of it. You see, women tend to remember. And Rachel is human. She took you on at the right time and decided, on her own, when to call it a day.”

“Was I just an ‘episode’ in her life?”

“Perhaps. And, of course, it is over. But all in all, neither of you has grounds to regret the past.”

Mother was pleased to gather that Ruth and Boaz would be working out the details of an ex gratia settlement. When I told her about my dinner appointment with Rachel, she urged me to talk as little as possible about the case.

“You better make it clear to Rachel that your affair did not leave a bitter taste in your mouth. That’s what she wants to hear.”



I got back to our courtroom at about 2.15 pm. One of Ruth’s assistants handed me a note advising that Rotem has agreed to make an ex gratia payment of an amount slightly above Rachel’s original offer. A few minutes later, Boaz stepped in accompanied by Fischer. Stepping over to my side of the courtroom, he confirmed the details of the arrangement.

“How did you feel about Morag’s intervention, Eli?”

“Coming from him it was fine. I don’t think another judge would have stepped in like that. Thank goodness, he did not persist.”

“I was getting ready to object when he handed poor Fischer back to you.”

“What on earth possessed him? Morag has a short fuse. Still, he knows how to control himself.”

“Fischer was unnecessarily rude to you. But I think there is a background. Before Morag’s wife ran away, she had a number of affairs. I believe one was with Fischer.’

“Did Morag know?”

“Rumour has it that he did. Still, Fischer appeared as an expert witness in a few cases tried by Morag recently. Morag showed no irritation on these occasions. In any event, the present dispute has been settled. Accordingly, all is well.”

“But why did Fischer play the fool? He is a shrewd fellow. What’s the matter with him?”

“I found out three days ago. I’d like to tell you over dinner.”

“Rachel has asked me out for tonight. How about lunch tomorrow?”

“I’ve got to catch the bus to Haifa before 3.00pm.”

“Let’s then meet in our old eatery at 11.45am.”



As soon as Morag returned to court, Boaz advised him of the settlement. Morag made it clear he was pleased. He assumed that the matter of costs had been attended to and that there was no need for him to write a full judgment.

“Procedurally, there is no need, Your Honour. But I am convinced my Learned Friend, other members of the profession and, of course, I, would love to read Your Honour’s analysis of the issue.”

“I couldn’t agree more,” responded Boaz.

“Very well then. It will be ready in about two weeks.”
