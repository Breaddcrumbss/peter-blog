After some three days I advised Thomas and the estate the terms of the agreement, cited as applicable, were binding under Singapore law. They concluded, on this basis, that they had a poor case. It seemed best not to prod them. Thomas said he was still hoping for a settlement.

“In that case you have to fight the case on the merits” I told him. “For instance, didn't the Bank owe special duties of care to a very old and illiterate customer? They did have his record!”

“That might turn into a difficult case,” interjected Freddie.

“It might,” I had to concede.  “But Thomas and I know that the courtroom is an arena. Once you enter it, you must be prepared to make use of the weapons available to you.”

“I wrote to the Chairman of the Bank’s Council. He was prepared to be generous until one of their chaps blocked the deal. What can we do?” asked Freddie.

“Fight,” I let my temper show. “Begging is not the way.”

He reflected and then summed up: “My bothers and I will discuss this with Thomas. I still think that my appeal to the Chairman may work.”
