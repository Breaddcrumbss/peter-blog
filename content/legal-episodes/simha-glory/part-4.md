Some three weeks later, when Jacob Keren and I were shown into Israel Silver’s spacious office, the Balanis were already there. Shimon had left before the negotiations started. Duty, so he said, was calling. So Simha and his wife faced us on their own. 

Patiently Jacob Keren outlined the fresh proposal: Simha was promised a monthly pension equal to 90 per cent  of his last salary, index pegged, plus part-time employment as receptionist until he reached the normal age of retirement. His pension would be based on the average wages of his last two years and, again, would be indexed. In addition, Rotem would settle his running medical bills and related expenses. When Keren finished,  Israel Silver confirmed it was an excellent offer and “as far as one could expect the defendants to go.” Boaz nodded his approval. 

“But no lump sum?” asked Simha.

“No,” countered Israel Silver, “but the pension gives you greater security over the years! Most importantly: inflation won’t be a hazard!”

“I am sure it’s a generous offer,” said Simha. “I’ll have to discuss it with Shimon.”

Before Silver could respond, Boaz stepped in: “but remember, Simha, the damages are for you: to compensate you for the injuries you have suffered. This is as it should be! What do you think, Mrs. Balani?”

“Oh, Simha must decide. If he wants to talk to Shimon: he must do so,” she spoke with a touch of resignation.

“Well; let Mr. Silver know as soon as possible.” Keren spoke in a matter of fact voice. 

“Of course, Mr. Keren,” agreed Simha. “Thanks for going out of your way.”

“That alright. We try to do the right thing,” Keren nodded and, to my surprise, smiled.
