Franz Wolf, who had kept his silence till this point, fidgeted and eventually spoke his mind. He wondered whether Rotem might get the manufacturers to cover part of the loss. His own efforts had failed as had Boaz’s direct appeal to their humanity. Still, Franz Wolf wondered whether the issue should be referred to Rotem’s re-insurers. In the ultimate, the loss would be settled by them or by the German re-insurers of the manufacturer’s insurers. If the two re-insurers had a knock-to-knock agreement, the final award of damages might actually be apportioned between them.

“An excellent strategy,” approbated Rachel. “I trust Rotem will pursue it.”

“We sure will,” affirmed Hannah.

“I am gratified,” said Franz Wolf. “These Schweinehunden should be taught a lesson!”

Ruth Schwartz, Hannah Hod and I grinned. Jacob Keren, Rachel, Boaz and Ben Zion looked bewildered. As I explained the meaning of the Teutonic swear word, I reflected that many Yekkes used German invective where others would stick to Hebrew. Cultural affiliation affected all facets of life.

The meeting was over. Franz Wolf asked me to accompany him, explaining he wanted to talk about our mutual interest in porcelain.  For a while we stuck to the topic. Then, having voiced his views about porcelain, Franz Wolf turned to the real topic weighing on his mind. He had decided to take up a position in Hamburg and proposed to migrate within two or three months.

“You understand?” he let his anxiety show.

“I do and – Herr Wolf – my own father returned to Vienna as soon as the Russians pulled out. He yearned to be back in his old milieu.”

“Can the case be settled before I leave?”

“I think so. And I’ll do what we can. The key is Ben Zion Vered. Ruth and Hannah want Dahlia to have the money needed for the best medical treatment. I sensed it today.”

“Actually, so did I. And Ben Zion Vered does not need much pushing.”
