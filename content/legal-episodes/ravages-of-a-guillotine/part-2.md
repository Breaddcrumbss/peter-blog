Dahlia Nissim and her mother, Rivka, were seated in front of the spacious desk, which made Jacob Keren look bigger than life. Both gazed at us with curiosity mingled with apprehension. Our first task was to make them feel at ease. To win a case, you must enjoy your client’s trust and confidence. As soon as Jacob Keren concluded the introductions, in which he alluded to us as his star team, Rachel set out to break the ice.

“I gather you are back in School, Dahlia.”

“I am,” Dahlia had a pleasant, resonant, voice. “And it’s good to be back.”

“In this regard everything is back to normal,” observed Rachel.

“Not exactly.”

“How come?”

“Before the accident many boys were nice to me. Now I’m more friendly with the girls. Before the accident some girls were sort of perhaps jealous because I was so popular. But now it is different. I think some boys are embarrassed because of my hands.”

“You really think so?” asked Rachel.

“Are these questions really necessary?” interceded Rivka Nissim.

“I think we’ll let Miss Zeitlin raise the points now. They will be relevant when we proceed,” stepped in Jacob Keren. Rivka shrugged.

“Oh, I don’t think they are unkind,” explained Dahlia. “But they used to tease me and – you know – try to show off. Now they don’t know how to behave. They don’t want to offend me. So, they keep away.”

“And the girls?” persisted Rachel.

“They’re no longer threatened by my being so popular.  It makes them feel good to be kind. And I’m grateful: it’s good to have friends.”



Obviously, Dahlia had retained a positive even if realistic outlook on life. Most importantly: she had accepted her lot. Her responses convinced me she had a strong character and was not inclined to whine. If the matter ever proceeded to a hearing, her realism would stand her in good stead.

For a while, Rachel went on in the same vein. As she proceeded, Jacob Keren’s face brightened. He knew that, to win a complex case, it was essential to have a strong willed yet sensible client. When, in due course, Rachel was through, he signalled it was my turn.  With some trepidation, I raised points that kept bothering me about the accident.

“How do you think it happened, Dahlia? The switch was off?”

“Oh, yes” she affirmed. “If it’s on, we can’t remove the protective guard!”

“And if somebody switches the machine on when the guard has been removed?”

“But it can’t be switched on. If the guard is off the switch is inoperative!”

“So how do you think it happened, Dahlia?”

Jacob Keren’s raised hand blocked Rivka’s unuttered protest. She yielded but glared at me unhappily. Dahlia fidgeted and then, with some hesitation, replied: “I really don’t know – honestly.”

“I don’t understand, Dahlia, how could the blade  move when the machine was off?”

“Perhaps because the main switch was on?” Dahlia spoke in undertone.

“Shouldn’t it also have been switched off?”

“The manual said so. And Mr. Wolf insisted we read it. But the big ceiling fans are also connected to the main switch. If you switch it off everybody complains the room was stuffy. So, we always left it on!”

“Did Mr. Wolf know?”

“Sometimes he also handled the machine and left the main switch on; everybody did!”

“You see,” exploded Rivka.

“Yes: but this is essential. We must know the facts,” Keren let his annoyance show.

“One more question, Dahlia,” I sped on. “Did the blade ever move before when the machine was switched off?”

“Not when I was working there!”

“Why don’t you tell them it never happened,” interceded Rivka. “Mr. Wolf told us.”

“No, Rivka,” insisted Jacob Keren. “Dahlia is doing fine. She tells us what she knows herself. What others told her is hearsay. She can’t testify to it. If necessary, we’ll ask Mr. Wolf. Any further questions, Eli?”

“I’d like to know more about Mr. Wolf’s behaviour.”

“He was really good to me,” confirmed Dahlia. “He came many times to see me in the hospital. He brought me chocolate; and he unwrapped it for me and was happy when I took it. And, you know, I don’t really like sweet things: but I wanted to please him. So, I ate it; and I don’t want you to do him any harm. He suffered enough!”

“What do you mean?” asked Rachel

“He lost his wife. And she used to run the office. I think this is why the policy lapsed. And he is a good man!”

The meeting came to an end shortly thereafter. Keren asked Rivka to contact Rachel or myself if she obtained any further information. We would contact her once we decided how to proceed.



Jacob Keren asked Racel and me to stay behind. He wanted to assess the information available to us and settle on a basic plan. Like us, he was impressed with Dahlia’s personality and bearings: she would be a good witness, and her demeanour was bound to command respect  and invoke the Court’s sympathy.  All the same, what argument was to be used to persuade Rotem to admit liability?

“Is there room for an action against the manufacturers?” asked Rachel.

“They’re a German firm,” advised Keren. “It may depend on German law. Let’s see if Wolf has any information.”

“Actually, I’m having dinner with the Tamirs on Thursday. I’ll see if Wolf told anything to Boaz,” I volunteered.

“Excellent,” grinned Keren. “You may also ask more about that main switch. After all, Wolf’s fight is with Rotem. It’s in his interest to form a common front with us. Well, see me next week. We must get cracking while the iron is hot. I only wish Rotem was represented by a more amenable fellow than Ben Zion Vered.”

“At least he knows what’s he doing,” countered Rachel.

“True. But he may have a grudge against Eli and Boaz; on account of that ‘ass’ debate!”

“How do you know about it, Mr. Keren?”

Keren chuckled. “I was there, and I enjoyed every minute of it – but I don’t think  Ben Zion did. And you did rub his nose in it.”

“Let’s hope he sees the bright side,” sighed Rachel.

“Might as well hope for a miracle” concluded Keren.
