The matter was now settled. Jacob Keren had to leave in order to attend another meeting. Rivka and Dahlia hurried to catch a bus. Hannah, too, had to get back in order to prepare dinner for Tali and herself. Ruth Schwartz, Boaz and Rachel stayed behind in order to draw up the settlement agreement.

Feeling that his presence was no longer required, Franz Wolf got ready to depart. As I accompanied him to the entrance door, he observed that it was fortunate we had managed to conclude the negotiations. His employers in Hamburg were pressing him to come over as soon as possible and now he was able to do so. He planned to leave by the end of the month.

“Is your flat in Hamburg ready?”

“It needs some renovations, but I am moving in as it is. I’ll just give her a coat of paint.”

“I hope you’ll be happy there. And if you travel through Germany you are bound to find good porcelain,” I said with a touch of  envy.

“I’ll make the best to get some,”  he grinned. “But look, before I leave I want to make suitable arrangements for him. Will you please look after him?”

I had no doubt about the contents of the small olive-wood box he shoved into my hand. As I opened it, Harley smiled at me. Unable to contain myself, I caressed his sparkling jacket with my index finger. 

“He likes you,” said his owner.

“But how will you manage without him? Surely, he hasn’t stopped talking to you?”

“Of course not. But I am pushing on and in Hamburg I shall have a day to day existence. For myself, this is acceptable. But I can’t bear the thought of his ending up in an old curiosity shop and this time falling into the hands of a Philistine.  With you he would be as safe as he had been with me. Please take him.”

“Thanks,” was all I managed to bring out.
