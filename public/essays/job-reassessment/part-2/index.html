The remaining part of verse 2 and the rest of the chapter are poetic and differ from the explanatory caption preceding them.\nThe prologue is followed by the exchanges between Job and his three friends: Elifaz the Temanite [Yemenite], Bildad the Shuhite and Zofar the Na’amatite. These encompass chapters 3 to 27. They are expressed in fine poetry. In essence, Job questions divine justice, maintaining his being innocent. His friends argue that God is just and that Job’s sufferings must be due to his having sinned. Job disputes their stand and protests his innocence in a final monologue (caps. 29 to 31).\nNext come the words of Elihu, a young outsider who is not referred to either in the prologue or in the epilogue. Elihu’s arguments cover chapters 32 to 37. Elihu’s speeches differ in style and vocabulary from the earlier chapters of Job. Notably, scraps of them were found in Qumran and they are also included in the Qumran Scroll, in the late Targum and in the LXX. They too will be discussed subsequently, including the issue as to whether they constitute an integral part of Job.\nThe penultimate part of the book – chapters 38 to 42:1-6 – are God’s Replies from the Whirlwind [Storm: סערה] and Job’s response. They assert God’s greatness (which has not been doubted by Job) and imply that His justice is unquestionable. All the same, they do not explain why in some instances wrongdoers or villains are not penalized. Job was included in the MT on the basis of these chapters. Regrettably, they raise difficult issues especially in respect of Job’s apparent acquiescence.\nBefore turning to the different parts of Job, it is important to stress that the poetry is outstanding. This is the case as regards the speeches of Job and his friends and the replies of God from the Whirlwind. Doubtless, some other books of the MT encompass fine poetry. Deuteronomy chapter 32 (Ha’azinu [האזינו]), Jeremiah 31, Psalms 104 and Isaiah 40 are amongst them. Job’s last monologue (caps 29 – 31) surpasses even these.\nSee, in particular, Esther: 2:5, introducing Mordekhay. ↩︎\n","wordCount":"446","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-07-23T15:57:02+08:00","dateModified":"2025-07-23T15:57:02+08:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Peter Ellinger"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/essays/job-reassessment/part-2/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Peter Ellinger","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/ accesskey=h title="Peter Ellinger (Alt + H)">Peter Ellinger</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
