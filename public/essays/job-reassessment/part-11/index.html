Books I and II of the tome demonstrate a highly sophisticated and analytical examination of the term. But could this analysis have been known to the anonymous author of Job?\nSocrates was born at around 470 and died in 399 BCE. Plato’s dialogues respecting Socrates, including The Republic,2 were composed between Socrates’ death and Plato’s first trip to Sicily in 387 BCE. It is believed that they became well known throughout the Levant as indeed were other writings respecting Socrates, such as Xenophon’s Memorabilia and Aristophanes’ Clouds. However, and as stated above, these appear to have been composed after Job.\nAt first glance, this suggests that Job could not have been influenced by these works or by Greek philosophy. The dialectic, or debating approach, was however used in Greek politics even before it permeated into philosophy. It was the method used in debates at the Athens Assembly.\nAn attempt to unveil the origin of these Greek polemics is outside the scope of this investigation. Suffice it to emphasize that two friends of the young Socrates – Pericles and Alcibiades – were masters of rhetoric.3 Notably, Pericles’ consort, Aspasia,4 was well acquainted with Socrates. It is likely that her skills influenced the young philosopher, were adopted by him during his later years and, in due course, became the basis of the debating or dialectic approach employed in Plato’s dialogues. If this were the case, the technique of Athens’ political leaders was likely to have been known to the author of Job.\nThat Job uses the debating, or dialect, approach is clear. A proposition – namely theodicy – is posed and discussed at length. Undoubtedly, some books of the Old Testament have lengthy statements of an issue, such as the duty to observe law. Isaiah and Jeremiah are examples in point. Others concentrate on the praise of God. Psalms provides the best illustration. Other books still, for instance, Judges and Samuel\\Kings are of the narrative gender.\nFurther, the dialectic method is alien even to Biblical Books of Wisdom other than Job. Proverbs and Ecclesiastes set out sharp and usually concise epigrams, which prescribe an appropriate and wise norm of conduct. It is true that, in some instances, the advice or prescription encompasses a number of verses5 but these do not question the issue.\nIt may be argued that the Talmud is renowned for the use of dialectics. This is, undoubtedly, true as regards the later part of the Talmud – the Gemara [גמרא], which was sealed in the 8th century CE. The earlier part of the Talmud – the Mishna [משנה] – does not use it. It is written in resonant Hebrew and was probably sealed by the end of the 2nd century CE. Basically, it includes legal principles and short narraratives. It supports the view that, in the period in which Job was written, dialectics (or the Socratic discourse) were not practised in Judaism. All this leads to the conclusion that, unless the author of Job invented the method on his own, he was influenced by a method common elsewhere, such as Greece at the relevant time.\nThe suggestion that Job manifests Greek influence is not novel. In 1918 Kallen opined: “The Greek influence is … beyond question.” He then explains: “ … we have in the Book of Job … a Hebraized form of the Greek tragedy…”.6\nKallen’s opinion of the influence of Greek tragedy is to be doubted. The impact of the dialectic method is obvious.\nהצור תמים פעלו כי כל-דרכיו משפט. אל אמונה ואין עול, צדיק וישר הוא.
