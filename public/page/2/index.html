    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>It is time to turn back to my years in Wellington. The geographic remoteness did not distance Ranjan and me from one another. We corresponded periodically but, of course, had less occasion for exchanges of views and of impressions than during our days in Oxford and in Singapore. Each was preoccupied with his own career. I tried hard to settle in the windy capital of New Zealand. My problems were related mainly to my family life and to the occasional hiccups of academia. Ranjan sought to rise in his home country. His new milieu and environment were alien to me.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Ranjan was rising in politics, continued to make a fortune at the Bar and laid the foundation for the great leap forward. He refrained from referring to his marriage but once mentioned in passing that there was no sign of a ‚Äòfamily‚Äô. I drew my conclusions.
My own life, too, continued uneventfully. Then, one day, Pat spotted an advertisement for a new Chair of Law at Monash University in Melbourne. She nagged me into applying and ‚Äì with the help of Fortuna ‚Äì I got the job.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>At the end of my year of leave, we returned to Melbourne. I had to complete a few additional years of service so as to secure an adequate retirement benefit. I assured Pat that, in due course, we would move back to Singapore.
During this second spell at Monash, Marcus kept me informed about Ranjan. Politically, Ranjan moved from strength to strength. Within a few years, he became the President‚Äôs right-hand man. He was now tipped ‚Äòthe successor‚Äô and, in his own way, wielded power and influence. But ‚Äì all in all ‚Äì he had remained a subordinate. The reigns were still in his superior‚Äôs hands. Occasionally, Australian television showed him in the company of other members of the Sri Lankan cabinet, assembled around their leader and ready to run his errands.

    <p>Many years have passed since that fateful turn of events, covering Ranjan‚Äôs act of revenge and the atrocities committed in Jaffna. But even after Ranjan‚Äôs untimely death at the hand of a hired assassin, my mind kept mulling through the episode. One evening I slid to my antiques room in Singapore so as to discuss the matter with Tay Fung-Shuo ‚Äì now replaced by his porcelain Doppelg√§nger, dubbed Alfie.
‚ÄúSo you do old antiques dealer honour of unexpected visit,‚Äù Alfie chided me.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>The penultimate draft of The Hidden Rooms was completed when I was in my sixties. In 2010 I self-published it as part of The Scales of Fortuna. Nowadays, when I am in my nineties, I have revised it with a view to uploading in my blog.
Much has happened in the decades that had elapsed. Following my return to Singapore, I maintained a regular correspondence with Brian Davies. Before long, he made his exit from the City and, as planned, opened an art dealership with his daughter‚Äôs friend. All seemed clear on his horizon. His business was thriving. Then, one sad day, I received the death notice of his wife, Ruth. She had passed away peacefully from a heart attack. Initially, Brian remained in London but ‚Äì after a few months ‚Äì joined his daughter, who had migrated to New Zealand. Recently one of his granddaughters wrote that he had passed away. To my satisfaction, she described him as Grampa.

    <h2 class="entry-hint-parent">Chapter 11: Curtains
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>During my twenty years in Australasia, I had visited Singapore regularly. Adjusting to my new teaching environment was therefore an easy task. News about Ranjan trickled in mainly through Allen, who ‚Äì unlike Marcus in Melbourne ‚Äì was an avowed enemy. Marcus had, invariably, viewed Ranjan‚Äôs activities supportively. Allen underscored the seedy aspect of what he chose to tell me. He remained unabashed when, on one occasion, I gave vent to my resentment of his bias.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>A few years later, Ranjan‚Äôs sad end was vividly drawn back to my attention. One day I received an email in which the sender, who signed himself as Chula Jeyaratne, asked me for lunch. Initially, I was unable to identify him. I then recalled that I had met Ranjan‚Äôs younger brother, whose name was Chula, during my first visit to Colombo.
The man in his late middle age, who had arrived at the agreed venue before me, bore no resemblance to that unformed boy I had met years earlier. His black hair was laced with silver and his face was wrinkled.
