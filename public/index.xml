Reading the Decision and Lunch in the Pub&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>My interest in Wiseheart J.’s decision in the now classic case of Masterman Bank v. Seddon arose shortly after I arrived in Oxford in 1959. My object was to write a doctoral thesis on a banking facility known as the ‘commercial letter of credit’, which features in the export and import business. It facilitates international transactions by obtaining a bank’s promise to pay the price of goods. The vendor relies on the bank’s undertaking. The buyer, in turn, knows that the price is to be paid by the bank only if the vendor tenders the prescribed documents. Usually these include a carriage document, such as a bill of lading, evidencing that the goods have been shipped.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 1: The Case</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ingenius-fraud/part-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 22:55:55 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ingenius-fraud/part-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>Shortly after retiring from my post as a legal consultant, I received a telephone call from an old friend in arms. Thomas Aung, who still ran his legal practice although he was close to eighty, wanted my advice on the payment of fraudulently drawn cheques. As I now had ample time on my hands I agreed to discuss the case with him on the next day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The facts that unfolded during our conversation raised my eyebrows. The victim, a Mr. Lim who died at the ripe age of 92, had migrated to Singapore from China early in the 20th century. A poorly educated man, who had never mastered English, he succeeded to build up a reasonably prosperous sweetmeats business. Naturally, he needed a current cum savings account and, eventually, opened it with a bank that had a branch near to his enterprise. Being unable to sign his name in Latin characters, he used his Chinese signatures and a rubber stamp (a ‘chop’) setting out the name of the business.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 1: Two Bank Officers</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/matter-of-compliance/part-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 22:29:24 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/matter-of-compliance/part-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>It was late in the morning when Norbert Schneider, Head of the Bad Loans Department of the X. Bank called to tell me that he was coming over with Frederic Steiner (nicknamed ‘Freddie’), the Bank’s compliance officer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Bank was an important client of our firm. Further, Norbert and Freddie were friends of mine. This, of course, did not mean they were in one another’s good books. Despite their ostensibly amiable modus operandi, it was easy to spot the underlying antipathy. I had had pleasant luncheons with each. But never had they called on me together.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 1: The Brief and Bank Reference</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/matter-of-opinion/part-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 22:11:34 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/matter-of-opinion/part-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>The brief respecting the action of Maurice Vollar against the M. Bank landed on my desk just a few weeks before my wife and I migrated back to Singapore. It was the first interesting case referred for my opinion during my nine years in Australia. I was also pleased that it had been sent to me at the advice of Jack Wilson, a former student of my days in Wellington, who was to be the lead Counsel in the case.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 1: Facts of the Case</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/catalogue-description/part-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 22:03:05 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/catalogue-description/part-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>In those days – the late 1960ies – my office was on the first floor of the Victoria University of Wellington’s 19th century building. To get to it from the lobby, I had to enter the corridor leading to the library and pass the guard who asked you not to take your bag into the library. In my case, this rule did not apply.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I suspected that my office used to be the librarian’s room. Still, for the last ten years it had been the office of the Head of the English and New Zealand Law Department. I got its use when I was constituted a professor at Wellington’s University.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 1: Revisiting my Tel Aviv Home</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/scaffolding/part-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 21:26:38 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/scaffolding/part-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>Lydda’s airport – recently renamed the International Airport of Tel Aviv – had been reconstructed during my two years of study at Oxford and my two first years in Singapore. The old viewing gallery, from which you could drop a parcel with black market money to a departing friend, was gone. So were the untidy passages leading from the pandemonium of the main hall to the well guarded and orderly departure gates. The new airport looked smart, tidy and functional. Like most airports I had seen during my years of self-imposed exile, it had an impersonal atmosphere.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 1: A Sad Industrial Case</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/simha-glory/part-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 20:25:37 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/simha-glory/part-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>An interesting fact of life, reinforced by the Balani case, is that, occasionally, some apparently unrelated episodes may nevertheless be intertwined: the outcome of one may have a bearing on the other.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first information was a reportage in an Israeli newspaper. In dispassionate language, it related how a truck, that had been loaded with logs in one of Solbon’s depots near Haifa, arrived shortly before the Shabbath at its destination in Tel Aviv. It should have been there some two hours earlier but heavy traffic resulted in a protracted delay.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 1: Dahlia Nissim's Tragedy</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ravages-of-a-guillotine/part-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 18:47:35 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ravages-of-a-guillotine/part-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>That morning I arrived at work just before Rachel. She caught up with me at the foot of the staircase. Grinning, she conceded: “So you won the race, my pet. You must have got up right after you crawled into your bed.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“I don’t need much sleep. And you waited by your ‘phone for my call. I really don’t know why you fret like this.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“You left my flat at 2.00 a.m. and were too proud to call a taxi! You had to take the half hour walk home!”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 1: A Sad Incident</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/the-luck-of-valentino/part-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 18:09:01 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/the-luck-of-valentino/part-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>The correspondence respecting the case of Omri Tal versus Solomon Vered and Movil &amp;amp; Co. Ltd was dumped unceremoniously on my desk late in the morning, on a heavily clouded day in early spring, by Jacob Keren, sole proprietor of J. Keren &amp;amp; Associates, Advocates, of Rothschild Boulevard, Tel Aviv.

&lt;p>An event that took place in an underground-train station in Munich’s inner city had far reaching effects on the life of three persons: Peppi Stölzl – who rose thereafter in the world, became Sir Joseph-Dieter, Freiherr von Stölzenfeld – my late father, Robert Berger, known to friends as ‘Tommy’, and myself, Peter Berger, a mendicant professor who eventually settled in Singapore but travelled from time to time to London where eventually I met Peppi,&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Legal Publications</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/about-me/legal-pubs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 19:57:54 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/about-me/legal-pubs/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="list-of-peter-ellingers-publications-on-legal-topics">List of Peter Ellinger’s Publications on Legal Topics&lt;/h2>

Pension Kegel&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The electric car of Pension Kegel was waiting for me outside the railway station. Fastening my scarf to keep out the crisp air of a typical dawn in Zermatt, I walked briskly up the platform and got in. As often before, I breathed the clean air in deeply and with satisfaction. The absence of fuel driven motorcars was a blessing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The electric car driver, who was also the sole concierge of the modest establishment, manoeuvred his ramshackle vehicle adroitly through the narrow and winding lanes of my favourite Swiss resort. I observed with a grim smile that for him, too, time had not stood still: his wrinkles had deepened and his hair had turned silver grey. Bestowing on me the smile reserved for old customers, he carried my suitcase up the stairs to the reception counter.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Preface</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novels/bright-lion/preface/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 14:40:09 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novels/bright-lion/preface/</guid><description>&lt;p>The object of Bright Lion is to compare two approaches to Judaism. Whilst both are imbued with tolerance and understanding they are nevertheless distinct. One approach is that of the tolerant traditional observer who follows the commands of his faith but is not perturbed by the transgressions and by the non-conformity of fellow Jews. The other approach is that of a sceptic who doubts many of the tenets of the faith as well as the Bible’s historicity and does not observe commands he fails to understand. His adherence to Judaism is based on his acceptance of the ethnic affiliation of members of the community. He is tolerant of the view of orthodox believers, provided they do not attempt to force him to adopt their orientation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter 1: A Dilemma</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/a-candid-obituary/chapter-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 20:10:05 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/a-candid-obituary/chapter-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>My secretary had arranged the incoming mail in a neat pile. As I leafed through it, my glance fell on an envelope posted in Colombo. Was it a request for a reference from one of my recent Sri Lankan students? I was about to slice the cover open when Shamsiah’s call reminded me that my Banking Law class was to commence in five minutes. Reluctantly, I dropped the letter back on my desk, picked up my notes and hurried to my seminar room.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter 1: Above the Clouds</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-hidden-rooms/chapter-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 19:57:20 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-hidden-rooms/chapter-1/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="1-an-extraordinary-catalogue">1.

&lt;p>As the aeroplane steadied on its westward course, I started to skim through the papers respecting the legal entanglement that required my presence in London. Conscience and professional integrity dictated that I peruse the bundle meticulously. I owed this to the friendly law firm that was paying handsomely for my services and for the comfortable seat in the business class section of British Airways’ direct flight from Singapore.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 2: A Closer Look at the Case</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/worthless-goods/part-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 10:16:11 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/worthless-goods/part-2/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="1-a-closer-look-at-the-facts-of-seddons-case">1.

&lt;p>I knew jack was right. However, one point bothered me. In all trials, the judge’s decision is based on the facts proved to him. These, of course, might be at variance with what had really taken place. In some cases, the suppression of facts is intentional: the parties seek to cover up some sordid or illegal matter looming in the background.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 2: Am Asked to Opine</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ingenius-fraud/part-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 22:56:12 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ingenius-fraud/part-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Thomas’ main question was whether clauses of this type were binding under Singapore law. On behalf on the estate, he requested me to write an opinion. However, the facts were so unusual that I felt the need to meet the ‘estate’. The point that irked me concerned the statements. How would Lena know on which day the genuine statement would be put in the letter box? Unless she knew that, how would she know when to substitute for it the bogus statement? After all, she could not peep into the letter box day after day. And the Bank’s statements could be delivered at any time between the 10th and 20th of the month, a fact well known in Singapore. Further, she had only a day or two to prepare the bogus statement. After all, how could she be certain the late Mr. Lim would not summon her at the end of the month to draw a cash cheque?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 2: Hendra</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/matter-of-compliance/part-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 22:29:29 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/matter-of-compliance/part-2/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="1-hendras-latest-misdeed">1.

&lt;p>When Norbert and Freddie arrived, the former was out of breath. Notwithstanding his energetic and imposing bulk, he found it difficult to keep up with Freddie’s youthful speed. In addition, Norbert was badly shaken. I suspected the two had had a row. My fears, though, were allayed when Freddie asked Norbert to raise the problem they had encountered. My heart sank when Freddie said, impulsively, “Curse that bastard Hendra; what a Schweinehund!”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 2: The Facts Crystallise</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/matter-of-opinion/part-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 22:13:55 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/matter-of-opinion/part-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>My first advice to Jack Wilson, the bank&amp;rsquo;s lead Counsel, was to investigate the hidden facts. I further suggested that he get an opinion about the Belgian law in point. It turned out that, just as in Australia, a Belgian bank reference was not considered a business advice based on detailed research. This was particularly so if the reference was given without responsibility. Under Belgian law, such a disclaimer was effective. Another point emphasised in our Belgian legal opinion was that, as a matter of fact, the person who received the reference was entitled to bring an action to recover his losses only if he was able to establish that he had relied on the reference.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 2: The Pleadings</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/catalogue-description/part-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 22:03:07 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/catalogue-description/part-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Some two months later, Robert consulted me on the draft of his statement of claim, that is, the document in which the party that brings the action – the plaintiff or claimant – narrates his case. To my dismay, Robert had decided to proceed under both counts. He proposed to allege that the sales house had breached a duty imposed under the Sale of Goods Act. In other words, the auctioneers had given an incorrect description of the ‘goods’. As an alternative, Robert alleged that the statement respecting the mare’s condition, namely her being with fowl, constituted a negligent misrepresentation on the part of Douglas brown and that the sale house was liable together with him.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 2: Rachel Assigns Me a Case</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/scaffolding/part-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 21:26:41 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/scaffolding/part-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Next morning I walked over to Rothschild’s Boulevard. The old building, housing Jacob Keren’s law firm, looked as dilapidated as ever. So did the boulevard. The sparse shrubs along the centre lane had grown wild. They had not been pruned for months. Indeed, this ancient part of Tel Aviv remained as ugly and as untidy as it had been during my pupillage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The door to the office of the Head of Bank Documentation was slightly ajar. Having knocked and entered, I looked Rachel over with amazement. In her days as a courtroom advocate, she had looked tidy and trim. Now no trace was left of her smart coiffure and her elegant posture. I was facing a woman past her youth. True, her confident manner and her captivating smile had remained unaltered. Somehow, though, she no longer looked like the woman I had worshipped.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 2: A Chat With Rachel</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/simha-glory/part-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 20:28:14 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/simha-glory/part-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>For a few minutes I fidgeted in front of Rachel’s office. For a few months we had been lovers. Recently, I left my parents’ house and went over to live with her. I feared that a decision to handle the case on my own rather than as a team member might disrupt our friendship. Then I saw that the door to her office was ajar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rachel skimmed rapidly through the file. She did not take notes but flagged some pages in depositions and highlighted passages she considered important. When she finished, she closed the file and asked: “So why do you want my views about this file?”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 2: Meeting Dahlia - The Client</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ravages-of-a-guillotine/part-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 18:57:22 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ravages-of-a-guillotine/part-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Dahlia Nissim and her mother, Rivka, were seated in front of the spacious desk, which made Jacob Keren look bigger than life.

Although Hannah’s solid Hamburgese background differed in more than one way from my relaxed and light-hearted Viennese milieu, both of us were Yekkes. In a firm dominated by Russian Jews and Sabres this cultural affinity drew us together. Every so often, when we felt alienated by the rough mannerism and Chutzpah of our colleagues, we reverted to German, earning hostile glances from those present. In addition, Hannah and I shared a taste for books and for good films. Frequently, we lent German novels to one another and, occasionally, went together to the cinema. Another, even stranger, bond was that both of us suffered from Asthma. When either of us came down with an attack, the other lent a supportive shoulder.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter 2: Mayhem and the Brotherhood of Man</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-devil-in-munich/chapter-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 21:23:14 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-devil-in-munich/chapter-2/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="1-the-locum-and-his-provocation">1.

&lt;p>I doubt if Pilkin and I would have become mates had it not been for the Josephus Flavius trial staged by TA.1 in 1950. Although the War of Independence was by then long over, Israel had not fully recovered from its economic and social effects. Commodities were scarce, prices were high and the black market was booming. One of the objectives of Israeli schools of that period was to turn its pupils into good citizens. Nobody was held in greater contempt than a traitor to the struggle for the survival of the two years old nation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 1: Getting Started</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novels/bright-lion/part-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 14:41:47 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novels/bright-lion/part-1/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="1-visit-to-yentls-grave">1.

&lt;p>Earlier today I resolved to write my autobiography. I was mulling the idea over since the day Yentl came up with it. She had just finished reading the memoirs of an American politician. She thought his style was good and had appreciated his anecdotes. But, she asked, why did he presume others had an interest in his mundane manoeuvrings and dull existence on the fringes of Washington D.C.?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter 2: A Gifted Youth</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/a-candid-obituary/chapter-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2025 12:49:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/a-candid-obituary/chapter-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>My knowledge of Ranjan’s youth is based on what he thought fit to tell me and on occasional remarks of his contemporaries. A model primary school pupil, a boy scouts leader and a fine cricket player were on the credit side. A tricky fellow, one ready to snitch when it suited him, and a mercenary to boot, were remarks made by those who disliked him. One of them told me that Ranjan would display enthusiasm when he was the key figure in some sporting event, but often lost interest when it was the turn of others.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter 2: Past Perfect</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-hidden-rooms/chapter-2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 19:59:06 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-hidden-rooms/chapter-2/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="3-a-confused-day">3.

&lt;p>Bill Riggs was waiting for me at the arrival hall of Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport. He was, actually, looking fresher and more vigorous than he had ever appeared in Singapore. For a short while we gossiped about mutual friends in Singapore, about my forthcoming book and about his own work in his London firm. Then, as if by prior arrangement, we turned to business. I started by expressing my doubts respecting the outcome.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 3: Behind The Façade</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/worthless-goods/part-3/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 10:16:13 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/worthless-goods/part-3/</guid><description>&lt;p>Gray offered to obtain copies of the banking forms used in the Seddon case and of the correspondence between Seddon and his counterparty. His efforts, though, were fruitless: the Masterman Bank refused to discuss the subject. The lawyers, too, clammed up. They relied on the confidentiality principle. In principle, they were right. Still, G &amp;amp; M was a house of standing. Accordingly, the reticence of the M. Bank and of its lawyers struck me as odd.

My motivation was simple. After almost fifty years with the law, I had no wish to tarnish my reputation by getting involved in a questionable case. Further, I was afraid of ending up with an omelette on my face.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The late Mr. Lim’s three sons were waiting for me when I arrived for the meeting, which took place in the unadorned conference room of the old law firm. Thomas emphasised that we were dealing with a ‘modest’ estate. Substantial expenditure was to be avoided. Initially, the estate had hope that the Bank would come up with a settlement. But up to now the Bank had taken a militant stand.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 3: A Mobile Phone Deal</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/matter-of-compliance/part-3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 22:29:31 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/matter-of-compliance/part-3/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="1-vanishing-ink">1.

&lt;p>“It all relates back to the consolidation of his accounts. You see, Peter, we have just received a remittance of S$500,000.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Why not set the amount off against his debt?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“He has further instructed that S$400,000 be remitted to a numbered Swiss bank account.

Accordingly, the trial commenced at the prescribed date. As anticipated, Vollar took the stand as soon as his Counsel completed his opening address.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Under the rules of procedure then applicable in Western Australia, his Counsel took him through the facts of the case. It became clear that the business had failed and that Vollar had lost his investment and had made no earnings for months. In that regard, I felt considerable sympathy for him. Still, as the facts unfolded, I kept wondering why he had not taken professional advice before his injected his funds into the business. It was clear from the reference that, on occasions, the business exceeded the limits of its overdraft.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 3: The Auctioneer's Defence</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/catalogue-description/part-3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 22:03:09 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/catalogue-description/part-3/</guid><description>&lt;p>For a while, I heard no more about the case and, actually, it skipped my mind.

&lt;p>“She is no longer the woman I fell for. She is a different person.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“But, Peter’le, did you fall for the real Rachel or did you create your own image of her?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mother’s question made me see light. The real Rachel was a fine woman: smart, vivacious and enterprising. She had entered into my barren life at the appropriate moment. But, in my simplicity, I had placed her on a pedestal. I had created a perfect statue and, like Pygmalion of old, was perturbed when I discovered her real image.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 3: Simha's Stand on a Pension</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/simha-glory/part-3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 20:28:16 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/simha-glory/part-3/</guid><description>&lt;p>During the following weeks I managed to make some progress with Simha’s matter. Despite its plain nature, the case had some perplexing angles. Rotem’s offer of a pension was attractive. Simha had been a salaried employee all his life. By the time of the accident, he was getting close to retirement. What then induced him to prefer a lump sum. I was also puzzled by his rush to save the neck of another. Why should a street wise operator take a risk of this sort?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 3: Rachel and I Analyse the Case</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ravages-of-a-guillotine/part-3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 18:57:25 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ravages-of-a-guillotine/part-3/</guid><description>&lt;p>Rachel’s and returned to her office. As we went again through the facts, we concluded the accident had been triggered off by a fault in the machine. Still, in an action against the manufacturers it would hard to establish the fault. We preferred a suit against Wollor – the local firm – provided Rotem admitted liability. The question was how to persuade it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the ultimate, it was an open-ended issue. Wolf’s record with the insurers would, undoubtedly, be a relevant fact. So would the orientation of Rotem’s personnel in charge. In this regard, both Rachel and I had some hope. Any decision of the Board of Directors would depend on a recommendation of the in-house lawyers. We knew both well and so embarked on an assessment of their likely reaction.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 3: Setting Traps</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/the-luck-of-valentino/part-3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 18:16:29 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/the-luck-of-valentino/part-3/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hannah spent two weeks in the dental laboratory of an old acquaintance.

&lt;p>Following this encounter, Peppi started to go from strength to strength. His friendship with Dad remained intact, with each rejoicing at the other’s success. Their paths, though, did not cross again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For Dad, the turning point was Russia’s withdrawal from Vienna in 1951. He and Peppi saw in it Theophil’s hand. Modern historians have come up with a more mundane explanation: Russia’s bridgehead in Vienna was of no military, political or tactical advantage. Austria’s unilateral declaration of neutrality – the price exacted by the Russians for their withdrawal – constituted a safer barrier against Western aggression than the sparse Red Army troops stationed in the old Habsburg capital.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter 3: Learning the Law: Courts and Keren</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/reunion-in-zermatt/chapter-3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 18:13:45 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/reunion-in-zermatt/chapter-3/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="1-we-attend-trials">1.

&lt;p>Our teacher granted us leave to attend court hearings during three mornings dominated by classes on science. As Pilkin’s home was not far from the District Court building, I went to pick him up early in the morning. His mother’s unadorned poorly furnished flat on the top floor of a run down apartment block made me gape. Obviously, his late father had not left them well off. Embarrassed, I remembered Shosh had told me that, when opportunity presented itself, Pilkin and his young brother, David, carried out odd jobs, such as deliveries, doubling up for newspaper vendors and occasional home repairs. To my relief, Pilkin appeared unaware of my consternation. He watched with satisfaction as I sipped the cup of hot and aromatic lemon tea his mother brought me and then showed me, with relish, his small but neatly organised and catalogued collection of coins.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 2: Youth in Israel</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novels/bright-lion/part-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 14:43:13 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novels/bright-lion/part-2/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="2-an-odd-jobs-boy">2.

&lt;p>Father passed away a few weeks before my eighth birthday. My brother David was just three years old. I stood by the still uncovered grave, beside Mother who was crying. My eyes, in contrast, remained dry. What I recall most vividly is my impatience to go home because I thought that David, who had remained in the care of a neighbour, might need me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As yet, the meaning of our loss had not dawned on me. I knew, of course, that I was not going to see my smiling, active and supportive Father ever again. He would no longer pat my shoulder and grin proudly when I showed him my school grades. He had gone – so Mother said – to a better world where he would know no sorrow or pain. The effect that his death was bound to have on us – the constraints of a family without a breadwinner and the ensuing financial problems – were beyond my grasp.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter 3: The City of the Lion</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/a-candid-obituary/chapter-3/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2025 12:50:55 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/a-candid-obituary/chapter-3/</guid><description>&lt;p>Agnes turned out to be a vivacious English-educated Chinese, some five or six years older than Ranjan.

&lt;p>A classy BMW, booked by Yuan Ming in London, was waiting for us on our arrival in Cologne airport. I was relieved when one of the firm’s employees offered to drive us through the hectic traffic of the town to the shore of the Rhine. A tour of the dome was complemented by our lengthy visit to the nearby Germanic museum, a modern structure encapsulating a Roman mosaic.

&lt;p>Jack’s advice was sound. Although I had formed a reasonably clear picture of the background facts, I had come to a dead end. I had virtually decided to give the case a miss, when I had a stroke of good luck.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cases to be litigated before a court in London were usually discussed with a member of a law firm, a solicitor. His task was to obtain the required evidence, to assess the basic nature of the case and to form an initial impression. When his work was done, the law firm referred the file to a barrister. If the latter thought the ‘cause’ was sound, he would prepare the case for trial.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 4: A Chat with the Bank's Employee</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ingenius-fraud/part-4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 22:56:16 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ingenius-fraud/part-4/</guid><description>&lt;p>Back in my office, I felt that something was fishy. The sons and heirs took the fraud lightly and did not even attempt to get at the truth. To satisfy myself that I was not being drawn into a morass, I obtained a copy of the proceedings instituted by the prosecutor against Lena. It turned out she had confessed and her lawyer’s only task was to plead for a light sentence. The police did not attempt to trace the money. Indeed, this was not their task.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 4: A Money Laundering Issue</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/matter-of-compliance/part-4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 22:29:33 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/matter-of-compliance/part-4/</guid><description>&lt;p>Heaving a sigh, Freddie raised the issue of the funds remitted and Hendra’s order to pay out a substantial part forthwith. Bearing in mind Hendra’s nefarious conduct, Freddie suspected that the case might involve money laundering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few years earlier, the issue would not have been a cause for concern. A bank’s function was to receive amounts payable to its customer and to execute his payment instructions if he had the requisite balance. The position changed in the wake of terrorist activities in the United States. Under American pressure, many governments in the Western World passed laws under which a bank was expected to freeze amounts suspected of coming from dubious sources and to notify the reserve bank. The funds would be unfrozen only if cleared by it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 4: Achat with Rena Katz During the Break</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/matter-of-opinion/part-4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 22:13:58 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/matter-of-opinion/part-4/</guid><description>&lt;p>I had lunch with Jack Wilson in the court&amp;rsquo;s cafeteria. The sandwiches were fresh but, all in all, the establishment was ramshackle and the tables, which could have done with mats or table clothes, looked egalitarian rather than inviting.

&lt;p>Throughout the break I watched Jack Wilson. From a starry eyed student, he had developed in to a fine courtroom advocate. Still, it was only natural that he wanted his old teacher&amp;rsquo;s post mortem on his performance. It gave me pleasure to assure him that that in my eyes he had carried the day. A lot, though, would depend on his own witnesses: Bruce Smith and the clerk who had read out the reference.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 4: The Trial</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/catalogue-description/part-4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 22:03:10 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/catalogue-description/part-4/</guid><description>&lt;p>The trial, which took place some two months later on, demonstrated that, in the case in question, Robert was no match for Thomas.

&lt;p>The more I looked at the documents the less easy I felt. Fischer had stated in his report of the accident that he had parked his car on the grounds at about 8.30 a.m. The car-park-attendant’s record suggested he had arrived half an hour earlier. I realised it might have taken Fischer time to find a vacant lot. Thirty minutes, though, suggested the car park had been near full.

&lt;p>Patiently Jacob Keren outlined the fresh proposal: Simha was promised a monthly pension equal to 90 per cent of his last salary, index pegged, plus part-time employment as receptionist until he reached the normal age of retirement. His pension would be based on the average wages of his last two years and, again, would be indexed. In addition, Rotem would settle his running medical bills and related expenses.

&lt;p>Originally, Ehood Morag’s liberal orientation had come as surprise to the legal fraternity of Tel Aviv.

Once they had recovered, they continued their walk home.

The foundation was laid when, some three years after our initial encounter, Jacob Keren accepted me as a trainee.

That gift stood me in good stead during my years in Wellington, in Melbourne and in Singapore. All the same, my greatest success as a lawyer remained the trial of Josephus Flavius in TA.1.

&lt;p>After the trip with Bushi and the culmination of the Suez Crisis I looked for a job. Financially, I could have stuck to my existing enterprises; they were sound. My ambition though was for a future on the stage. Bennie Ornan kept encouraging me to apply for a position in the army’s Entertainment Corps. He was convinced that my medical misadventure did not present an obstacle. I was, however, perturbed by the realisation that the Corps’ main object was indoctrination. I wanted to devote myself to art. For that reason I did not send feelers to TA.1. I knew that a teacher’s career was well paid and satisfactory. I knew also that, if I joined TA.1, Sheen would encourage me to perform shows.

&lt;p>“Thanks. And how does the case stand?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Our Judge is back in action. In the pre-trial conference, he urged the parties to settle!”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“And have you?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Whitehead and Blackburn won’t let us,” he said, referring to the two fighting cocks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“What’s the matter with those two?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“They had a quarrel – a shouting match – over the Wine Stewardship of their club. Since then they are not on speaking terms.”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 5: Banking Law and Blind Spots</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/worthless-goods/part-5/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 10:16:54 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/worthless-goods/part-5/</guid><description>&lt;p>My investigation of the hidden facts of Seddon’s case had been time consuming. At the same time, it did not impede the progress of my doctoral thesis. Jack, the publican, looked at me with concern when I arrived exhausted after long hours of work. Frequently, he treated me to a cup of strongly brewed black coffee and looked at me disapprovingly when I had a nip of rum.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few days later, I called again on Dennis Gray. I noticed the twinkle in his shrewd eyes when he handed me his meticulous notes respecting the drafts of the first two chapters of my thesis. His body language, too, indicated he thought my treatment was starry eyed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 5: I Submit my Opinion</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ingenius-fraud/part-5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 22:56:17 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ingenius-fraud/part-5/</guid><description>&lt;p>After some three days I advised Thomas and the estate the terms of the agreement, cited as applicable, were binding under Singapore law. They concluded, on this basis, that they had a poor case. It seemed best not to prod them. Thomas said he was still hoping for a settlement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“In that case you have to fight the case on the merits” I told him. “For instance, didn&amp;rsquo;t the Bank owe special duties of care to a very old and illiterate customer?

&lt;p>My contact was a former employee of our firm. When I had completed my narration, she pointed out that the matter was within the jurisdiction of another department. She didn’t wish to cross wires with them. Still, she rang up her counterpart in that department.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To my pleasant surprise I recognised the incumbent. She had been one of my favourite students some twelve years earlier. At that time, she had been in her twenties; and she still looked the same.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 5: Bruce Stands His Ground</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/matter-of-opinion/part-5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 22:14:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/matter-of-opinion/part-5/</guid><description>&lt;p>A few hours later, Bruce Smith asked me out for dinner. Over an excellent meal in an elegant sea food restaurant by the Swan River, he told me what had taken place in court during the afternoon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bruce had been subjected to a searching cross examination. Vollar&amp;rsquo;s Counsel tried to establish that, when Bruce composed he reference, he had hidden facts known to him, such as the Katz’ bankruptcy in South Australia. Bruce insisted that the reference revealed all material facts known to him and that he followed the Bank&amp;rsquo;s standard practice when he composed it. He had not written out the disclaimer because it would be read out to an enquirer such as Vollar as a matter of practice.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 5: Post Mortem</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/catalogue-description/part-5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 22:03:12 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/catalogue-description/part-5/</guid><description>&lt;p>Things came to their head a few days later on. One the senior professors came over to my room. Lawrence Gent was known as a fine courtroom advocate. He was as excellent when it came to legal points as when a case turned on the facts. At one stage, we appointed him dean but his commitments at court prevented him from running the faculty efficiently and so resigned. All of us treated him as the grand old man of the law school. His visits to the rooms of other colleagues were scarce.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 5: Lunch with Rachel</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/scaffolding/part-5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 21:27:16 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/scaffolding/part-5/</guid><description>&lt;p>During the Friday lunch, I devoured the Mediterranean dishes as if I had been starving for days. When the meal came to its end, an amused Rachel wanted to know what sort of food I took overseas. She grinned when I told her Chinese cuisine was tolerable but that the delight of boiled mutton kept eluding me during my two years at Oxford.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She was not surprised when I repeated my mother’s observation about the oddity of our instructions. She, too, sensed that Ruth might have acted without authority. All the same, it was best to stick to our instructions. The case was bound to turn on the legal issue. A searching cross-examination could be counter productive.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 5: Aiding Simha</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/simha-glory/part-5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 20:28:19 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/simha-glory/part-5/</guid><description>&lt;p>As Keren had to discuss some other matters with Silver, I left on my own. When I reached the ground floor, Malka Balani was manoeuvring Simha out of the lift. The wheelchair was heavy. She would be unable to manage the six stairs leading to street level. My training as a lawyer dictated that I refrain from any communications with the “other party”. My Israeli mores, though, militated against this: I was young and strong.

It took Boaz and me a brisk walk of some twenty minutes to get there. Keeping up with the speed of my army trained friend was an effort. On arrival, we had to climb up a steep external staircase leading to the office. I was relieved to drop into the comfortable armchair proffered by our host.

He has a knack of complicating simple points!”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Don’t you think his analysis of our case is right? Isn’t Morag brilliant?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“He is; but only in a narrow field,” conceded Boaz. “But he is unbending and makes no allowances once he steers a course. Judges like him forget they deal with human problems: not with philosophical arguments!”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter 5: Peppi's Last Days in Munich</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-devil-in-munich/chapter-5/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 21:37:40 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-devil-in-munich/chapter-5/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="1-sale-of-the-munich-business">1.

&lt;p>Peppi decorated his new flat to his own taste. The Albigensian panel painting, which prior to Helga’s death had been kept out of sight, now adorned the wall of his study.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shortly after moving into his new flat, Peppi received two letters. Anna wrote to say she had completed her secretarial studies and had accepted a well-paid post in one of Bremen’s leading industrial firms. She thanked him for his support in the past but emphasised that she was relieved to be able, at long last, to ‘stand on her own two feet’. Peppi’s reply, congratulating her on her achievement, was laconic.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter 5: Early Years of Friendship.

&lt;p>In most regards, my success at the trial remained a Pyhrric victory. In the minds of the public, a worn cliché – “there is no smoke without fire” – defeated the logical argument. Josephus’ reputation remained as tarnished as ever. All the same, the historical trial of the long deceased historian constituted a milestone in my career. Recalling it vividly during the dinner in Pension Kegel, some 45 years after the event, I concluded that the prelude to the great football match remained my neatest achievement as a lawyer. Single handed, I had won a battle that took place in an unsympathetic, even prejudiced, forum. Relaxing in Pension Kegel’s comfortable sitting room as I sipped a cup of aromatic coffee, I mused on the episode and on the major effect it introduced into my erstwhile lonesome existence: it cemented a bond between Pilkin and myself.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 4: Based in New York</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novels/bright-lion/part-4/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 14:52:12 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novels/bright-lion/part-4/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="10-i-change-my-name-to-loeb-zohar">10.

&lt;p>When I think today, as an aged retiree, about my returning to the status of a student, I feel I took a leap into the dark. In reality, my positions, at the ITV and before it at Tichon, were good. To change course at such a late stage involved courage and an optimistic outlook.

Inwardly, though, I had misgivings. Jilting a girl was one thing; holding onto money given by the girl in anticipation of a union, put a different connotation on the episode. I knew for certain that, in similar circumstances, I should have restored the money to her family. Keeping it was both inappropriate and improper.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On this score, Ranjan showed no remorse. Risking both his own savings as well as Lillo’s bequest, he continued to dabble in the local stock exchange. Bank statements he showed me in confidence indicated that he was making steady gains.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 6: Jack and Seddon - One and the Same</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/worthless-goods/part-6/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 10:27:02 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/worthless-goods/part-6/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="1-unmasking">1.

&lt;p>My conversation with Dennis Gray convinced me that I had uncovered the seedy side of the Seddon case. Still, the picture was incomplete. I wanted to find out more about Seddon. What sort of a man was he? He was prepared to cut corners in his business dealings. But might he, nevertheless, be a decent man? As Jack had pointed out, most people carried out ‘little dishonesties’. Still, they did not turn against their sponsor. Seddon appeared to have done so. “Well,” I asked myself, “would it nevertheless be safe to leave him in charge of your home when you went for a trip abroad?” I felt the urge to meet him.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 6: Settlement and Post Mortem</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ingenius-fraud/part-6/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 22:59:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ingenius-fraud/part-6/</guid><description>&lt;p>A few days later on, Thomas asked me to present my fee note and advised me that they settled for $250.000. Thomas appeared deeply moved by the Bank&amp;rsquo;s generosity. I thought it best to congratulate him. All the same, I bit my tongue!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Quentin looked perturbed when we met the following week. After solving together a Bridge quiz, both of us were again at home with one another.

&lt;p>At 4 pm, Norbert rang up Hendra. He confirmed the receipt of the funds but added that the bank had exercised its set-off. In consequence, the account balance was well below the amount Hendra had ordered the Bank to remit.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 6: My Expert Evidence</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/matter-of-opinion/part-6/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 22:24:11 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/matter-of-opinion/part-6/</guid><description>&lt;p>Next morning It was my turn to step into the witness box. As was to be expected, witnesses of facts (and potential witnesses like Yuri) were no longer in attendance or in the ante-room. Further, Vollar’s expert-witness had withdrawn in the last minute. My duty of objectivity imposed on me as an expert of banking practice was, accordingly, undisputable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jack Wilson started his examination-in-chief by presenting my report and by asking if I felt the need to change it in any regards. I responded that I felt no reason to do so. Jack concluded that I was aware that my principal duty was to assist the court. Stepping in, the Judge emphasised the special duty of objectivity imposed on me as the single expert called as a witness.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 6: Meeting with Boaz</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/scaffolding/part-6/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 21:27:18 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/scaffolding/part-6/</guid><description>&lt;p>On Saturday – the day of rest in Israel – I went again through the documents. I was by then certain Fischer was lying between his teeth. Ruth was prepared to stand by him. Still, she had not asked us to throw the towel in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To look up recent authorities, I went down to the Supreme Court library on Sunday morning. As soon as I entered, I spotted Boaz. He, too, was refreshing his memory.

It reinforced her assessment of her boyfriend: an eccentric with an unworldly outlook. Her light-hearted airs gave way to a serious reflection when I outlined the information about the manufacturers’ response and the relationship between Rotem and Franz Wolf’s firm. She thought it best to discuss it straightaway with our employer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jacob Keren looked grave but was not unduly perturbed by the poor outlook of an action against the German firm. In any event, an attempt to sue it had to be deferred for the time being. Our clients were not wealthy and proceedings in a foreign country would entail extra expenses. This avenue might, however, be explored later on either by Franz Wolf’s firm or, possibly, by Rotem. In turn, the matter might be settled between the re-insurance companies of Rotem and of the insurers who covered the German manufacturers. Presently, we had to plan our campaign against Rotem.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 6: Hannah's Decision to Change Jobs</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/the-luck-of-valentino/part-6/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 18:19:21 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/the-luck-of-valentino/part-6/</guid><description>&lt;p>A few days passed before I managed to track Hannah down.

&lt;p>It took us just over two years to save enough money. By then, I had nearly finished my pupillage at Jacob Keren &amp;amp; Associates. Pilkin was slogging his way through his course at the Hebrew University and making every effort to shine on the stage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sipping a second glass of Cognac in the comfortable dining room in Pension Kegel, I recalled with amusement the unadorned berth my friend and I had taken on a Turkish ship sailing along the coast of Anatolia to Istanbul. It had been a no-frills trip marked by the need to economise. Yet, despite the parsimony dictated by our circumstances, our adventure had left a deeper impression on me than the many high class tours and neatly planned excursions I had enjoyed later on in life.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 5: Retirement</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novels/bright-lion/part-5/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 14:54:26 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novels/bright-lion/part-5/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="14-move-to-safed">14.

&lt;p>I returned to Brooklyn with the intention of giving up my position and proceeding to my retirement haven in Safed. I was now 65 years of age and sensed that my heydays were over and my bright youth in Tichon was far behind me. Nonetheless, my values and orientation on life had not changed. Throughout my journey I remained a non-fanatical and liberal believer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I conveyed my decision to Avner a few days after I made my final resolution to leave. For all practical purposes he was ready to take my place. He had completed his studies with flying colours, had proved himself as cantor and had delivered a number of sermons after prayer sessions. His style, though, differed from mine. He tended to concentrate on the topics covered by him without adding jokes or plays on words. In reality, his approach was more serious and traditional than mine.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter 6: Ranjan's Perspective</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/a-candid-obituary/chapter-6/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2025 12:52:46 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/a-candid-obituary/chapter-6/</guid><description>&lt;p>During my years in Wellington, I often soliloquised about Ranjan’s life. Years later, when we had returned to Singapore, I felt the need to clear my mind. My occasional talks with Tay Fung-Shuo, which I had during my first period in Singapore, threw no light on the episodes respecting Ranjan. Tay had remained tight lipped and, as soon as decorum permitted, changed the subject, usually by leading the way to some newly discovered antique porcelain.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 7: Dennis Gray Sums Up</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/worthless-goods/part-7/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 10:27:06 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/worthless-goods/part-7/</guid><description>&lt;p>Shortly after my discovery of Seddon’s identity, I took the train to London.

&lt;p>The Hendra affair did not disrupt my good relations with Norbert and Freddie. And strangely enough, the tension between them eased. In a sense, the affair brought them together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hendra remained a thorn in the Bank’s side. On quite a few occasions, as I passed by the building housing the Bank, I saw Hendra proceeding happily on to Collyer Quay.

At 9.00 a.m. on the appointed day, Justice Ehood Morag took his seat on the Bench. His quick glance at Simha’s wheelchair confirmed that Morag had read his papers and, in all probability, had made copious notes summarising the pleadings and the facts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both Boaz and I knew him well from our days at the Law School. Morag, who held an Adjunct Lectureship, had taught the course on the Law of Torts and some elective subjects. His brilliant mind had gained him universal respect just as his sharp tongue had antagonised students unable to keep up with him. Boaz and I had had no problems in this regard: each of us had been a star performer. Boaz, though, had found Morag too mercurial, too unpredictable, as a judge. I, in contrast, admired Morag’s intellectual feats on the Bench.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 7: Rottem Concedes Liability</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ravages-of-a-guillotine/part-7/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 19:02:03 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ravages-of-a-guillotine/part-7/</guid><description>&lt;p>Jacob Keren expressed satisfaction with the authorities I had unearthed in Jerusalem.

Each clever move cancelled out another, which meant that we produced more heat than light. The proceedings, though, did not disrupt our friendship. During the very same period, I came over regularly to the Tamirs’ residence, usually bringing with me a bottle of wine or, as was the custom in Israel, fresh fruit for their table. Invariably, we had a pleasant time, playing after dinner a game of Monopoly, listening to music, or discussing fervently some political events or newly published books. The only subject we stayed clear off was the Omri Tal trial.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter 7: Peppi's Delve Into Porcelain</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-devil-in-munich/chapter-7/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 22:27:55 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-devil-in-munich/chapter-7/</guid><description>&lt;p>Theophil’s Antiques continued to go from strength to strength as did Peppi’s fame.

&lt;p>Early next morning, as the Matterhorn emerged in its splendour at the first rays of light, I resumed my vigil. Soon the electric cars started to arrive from the station but the patrons alighting from them bore no resemble to my Pilkin of old. By 9.00 a.m. I threw in the towel. For all I knew, Pilkin might be snoring in a comfortable room in some other hotel in Zermatt. Despite his formidable size, he constituted a needle not easily pinpointed in the haystack of the buoyant flow of tourists in the popular resort.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 6: End of Journey</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novels/bright-lion/part-6/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 14:55:53 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novels/bright-lion/part-6/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="17-ithaca">17.

&lt;p>It was a dismal day. The skies were cloudy and it started to drizzle. All the same, I was set to walk over to the cemetery to visit Yentl’s grave. Apart from the flowers – a lovely bunch of Dahlias – I was going to take with me a copy of the manuscript. She had prompted me to write my autobiography. It was, accordingly, only right to bring her a copy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter 7: An Aspiring Politician</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/a-candid-obituary/chapter-7/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2025 12:55:17 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/a-candid-obituary/chapter-7/</guid><description>&lt;p>It is time to turn back to my years in Wellington. The geographic remoteness did not distance Ranjan and me from one another. We corresponded periodically but, of course, had less occasion for exchanges of views and of impressions than during our days in Oxford and in Singapore. Each was preoccupied with his own career. I tried hard to settle in the windy capital of New Zealand. My problems were related mainly to my family life and to the occasional hiccups of academia. Ranjan sought to rise in his home country. His new milieu and environment were alien to me.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 8: Seddon's Successor</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/worthless-goods/part-8/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 10:33:35 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/worthless-goods/part-8/</guid><description>&lt;p>A few months later I Left England to take up a post in Singapore.

&lt;p>The first person I called on when I arrived in London was Dennis Gray. He had aged during the ensuing three years and was getting ready to retire in a small village near Bath.

&lt;p>In due course, I invited Hendra for lunch. My object was to find out what had induced him to settle.

I was taking off my gown when Ruth Schwartz’s voice startled me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Why didn’t you stick to your instructions?” Her voice was harsh and her demeanour antagonistic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“What on earth do you mean?” I asked angrily. Before Ruth had the time to respond, Rachel approached us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“I’ll tell you what she means: she wanted us to lose the case. Well, Rotem did not instruct us to do so. And we should not have accepted such a brief. We are lawyers: not clowns.” Rachel was breathing hard. On occasions, I had seen her irked or annoyed. But she had never lost her temper before.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 8: Keren and Rachel Analyse the Judgment</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/simha-glory/part-8/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 20:37:36 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/simha-glory/part-8/</guid><description>&lt;p>Jacob Keren’s reaction to the judgment was short and to the point. If Simha Balani turned down the princely pension Solbon had offered, a lump sum was the proper compensation. What he did with the money was out of our control and, accordingly, not our concern.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Keren was equally nonchalant about the contributory negligence issue. He agreed that the defence had to be pleaded. A contribution of 20 per cent would have been preferable but 15 per cent was appropriate. His one admonition was that I refrain from pressing Solbon and Rotem to drop the defence. Simha had been aware it would be raised and we – the firm of Jacob Keren and Associates – represented the defendants – not Simha Balani. A decision not to pursue the defence of contributory negligence had to come from the clients and be made at their initiative.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 8: Franz Wolf Opines</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ravages-of-a-guillotine/part-8/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 19:02:05 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ravages-of-a-guillotine/part-8/</guid><description>&lt;p>Franz Wolf, who had kept his silence till this point, fidgeted and eventually spoke his mind. He wondered whether Rotem might get the manufacturers to cover part of the loss. His own efforts had failed as had Boaz’s direct appeal to their humanity. Still, Franz Wolf wondered whether the issue should be referred to Rotem’s re-insurers. In the ultimate, the loss would be settled by them or by the German re-insurers of the manufacturer’s insurers. If the two re-insurers had a knock-to-knock agreement, the final award of damages might actually be apportioned between them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 8: Justice Baruch Shoham</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/the-luck-of-valentino/part-8/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 18:19:34 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/the-luck-of-valentino/part-8/</guid><description>&lt;p>When Boaz returned to work, winter was just around the corner. Our pre-trial hearing with Baruch Shoham took place on a wet and chilly day. Unlike the sparkling conference table in Morag’s ante chamber, Shoham’s plain table was covered with books, untidily strewn files and proofs of articles to be published in The Advocate, which he edited for our Law Society. As we entered, he raised his eyes from the document in front of him and beckoned us to sit down.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter 8: Peppi Meets Peter Berger</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-devil-in-munich/chapter-8/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 22:29:42 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-devil-in-munich/chapter-8/</guid><description>&lt;p>Initially, Peppi’s new venture attracted limited interest. London was blessed with a number of well-established shops specialising in European ceramics. In addition, many experienced collectors tended to acquire their pieces at auctions. Peppi, though, had learned to bide his time and could afford to be patient. The modest profit made by the end of the second year of the ceramics venture signalled that he was on the right track. A few months thereafter his enterprise gained further momentum when two adjacent porcelain shops closed down. Peppi acquired the stock-in-trade of both dealers and, as anticipated, their customers turned to his shop.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter 8: Intermezzo</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/reunion-in-zermatt/chapter-8/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 19:16:02 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/reunion-in-zermatt/chapter-8/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="1-meandering-about-life">1.

&lt;p>As I relaxed over lunch in a booth table in the mountain establishment on the Riffelalp, I kept reflecting on the forty years that had passed since the days spent by Pilkin and me in Zermatt. Professionally, I had made it. Although I was not destined to develop into a court room virtuoso, it had not taken me long to rise from strength to strength in Jacob Keren &amp;amp; Associates. Initially, I had worked with Hannah Hod, the scion of an old Jewish family from Hamburg, who was a few years my senior. We won many of our cases and, in the process, developed a good, even if unromantic, friendship.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter 8: A Spiteful Reaction</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/a-candid-obituary/chapter-8/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2025 12:56:31 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/a-candid-obituary/chapter-8/</guid><description>&lt;p>Ranjan was rising in politics, continued to make a fortune at the Bar and laid the foundation for the great leap forward. He refrained from referring to his marriage but once mentioned in passing that there was no sign of a ‘family’. I drew my conclusions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My own life, too, continued uneventfully. Then, one day, Pat spotted an advertisement for a new Chair of Law at Monash University in Melbourne. She nagged me into applying and – with the help of Fortuna – I got the job.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 9: Reaching a Settlement</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/scaffolding/part-9/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 21:45:44 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/scaffolding/part-9/</guid><description>&lt;p>I had no wish to remain in the empty courtroom for about three hours or to join the queue of advocates at the cafeteria. To save mother the trouble of preparing a hasty lunch, I got myself a Pitah Falafel – a local delicacy which had lined the pockets of many a surgeon specialising in abdominal ulcer operations – and walked home. In those golden days of youth, a half hour’s walk appeared a trifle.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 9: The Appeal</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/simha-glory/part-9/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 20:37:38 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/simha-glory/part-9/</guid><description>&lt;p>Usually the preparation of an appeal was cumbersome. You had to capitalise on whatever supported your client’s case. If he was the appellant, your task was to drive holes in the judgment given against him. If he was the respondent, you had to find every argument supporting the trial judge’s conclusions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Simha’s case was different. Our clients had no objection to a substantial increase in the damages awarded to Simha. Ehood Morag, who had entered judgment for the maximum amount he could, made it clear he thought the compensation ought to be higher. The only other point of contention was the perturbing defence of contributory negligence. Rotem was not comfortable with it. As a matter of policy, neither they nor Solbon would have opposed a reform of the applicable English doctrines.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 9: Settling the Claim</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ravages-of-a-guillotine/part-9/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 19:02:08 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ravages-of-a-guillotine/part-9/</guid><description>&lt;p>Our next meeting took place two weeks later, on a Friday afternoon. This time Dahlia and her mother were also present. Both looked awkward and out of place. To my relief, Franz Wolf’s arrival eased the atmosphere. Dropping into a vacant chair beside Dahlia he talked to her in a quiet and measured voice. Taking our cue from him, the rest of us did our best to put mother and daughter at their ease. In due course, the clouds left Dahlia’s face.

Ignoring Boaz’s covetous glance in the direction of David Mizrachi’s Eatery, I steered a course to the old fashioned restaurant which served home cooked Jewish dishes.

&lt;p>I could fill a whole ‘bundle’ with anecdotes from my visits to London. Despite his advanced age, Peppi had retained his zest for life and his keen intellect; and he was full of fun. Lucy too was an excellent companion. Occasionally, when Peppi was reluctant to go out in the evening, the two of us went to the West End on our own. After the show, we would have a snack or a drink in one of the numerous bars where, often, I listened with admiration to Lucy’s witty critique of the performance.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter 9: Reunion.

&lt;p>My neatly tailored three piece grey suit, white shirt and fashionable tie did little to ease the pounding of my heart as I followed the concierge through the imposing dining room of the Zermattschein.

I had to complete a few additional years of service so as to secure an adequate retirement benefit. I assured Pat that, in due course, we would move back to Singapore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During this second spell at Monash, Marcus kept me informed about Ranjan. Politically, Ranjan moved from strength to strength. Within a few years, he became the President’s right-hand man. He was now tipped ‘the successor’ and, in his own way, wielded power and influence. But – all in all – he had remained a subordinate. The reigns were still in his superior’s hands. Occasionally, Australian television showed him in the company of other members of the Sri Lankan cabinet, assembled around their leader and ready to run his errands.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 10: Last Chat with Rachel</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/scaffolding/part-10/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 21:45:46 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/scaffolding/part-10/</guid><description>&lt;p>Rachel was waiting for me when I arrived sharp on time. I admired the skill she showed as she steered us through the congested traffic. To my delight, we got the very table we used to occupy in the same restaurant in times past.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rachel grinned again as I devoured the excellent dishes. During the first two courses we talked about the case. Rachel was happy with the settlement but, like myself, continued to wonder about Fischer. Why would an experienced expert witness step out of line for no apparent reason? He knew I had been instructed to handle him with silk gloves. What had induced him to become antagonistic when the reply was obvious and harmless?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 10: Post Mortem</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/simha-glory/part-10/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 20:37:40 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/simha-glory/part-10/</guid><description>&lt;p>Boaz and I had lunch in a small vegetarian eatery patronised by students. The food was wholesome and cheap even if plain. Boaz dug enthusiastically into a dish of aubergines and okra (called Bamia in our part of the world) and, for a while, was oblivious to what was going on around him.

&lt;p>Feeling that his presence was no longer required, Franz Wolf got ready to depart. As I accompanied him to the entrance door, he observed that it was fortunate we had managed to conclude the negotiations.

&lt;p>Much has happened in the decades that had elapsed. Following my return to Singapore, I maintained a regular correspondence with Brian Davies. Before long, he made his exit from the City and, as planned, opened an art dealership with his daughter’s friend. All seemed clear on his horizon. His business was thriving. Then, one sad day, I received the death notice of his wife, Ruth. She had passed away peacefully from a heart attack. Initially, Brian remained in London but – after a few months – joined his daughter, who had migrated to New Zealand. Recently one of his granddaughters wrote that he had passed away. To my satisfaction, she described him as Grampa.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 11: A Revealing Lunch with Boaz</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/scaffolding/part-11/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 21:45:48 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/scaffolding/part-11/</guid><description>&lt;p>Boaz arrived before me. As soon as we had placed our orders, he told me the truth about Fischer. A few days before our trial, Boaz went to have an eye check. As he stepped into the waiting room, Fischer emerged from the ophthalmologist’s room. His eyes were still blurred and so he failed to recognise Boaz. From Fischer’s conversation with the receptionist, Boaz gleaned that Fischer was making an appointment for the removal of one of his cataracts. Dr Much was uneasy about operating on both eyes together.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 11: Unexpected Development</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/simha-glory/part-11/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 20:37:42 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/simha-glory/part-11/</guid><description>&lt;p>Boaz’s last words struck a chord. All Along, I had been perturbed by a sense of helplessness. I wanted to do something for Simha – smart Alec as he might be – because I came to like him. The thought of his wasting away, wallowing in his own filth, appalled me. Without risking my future by crossing the floor, I had pulled as many strings as I could, hoping to work out an arrangement like a pension he could not afford to turn down. Jacob Keren and Ehood Morag, too, did their bit. In the end, though, a commonplace emotion on Simha’s part defeated our efforts. And the law could not and would not intervene.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 11: The Settlement Deed</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ravages-of-a-guillotine/part-11/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 19:04:37 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ravages-of-a-guillotine/part-11/</guid><description>&lt;p>When I returned to the meeting – having placed Harley in my breast pocket – I found that the matter was not proceedings as smoothly as expected. To be placed before the re-insurers, the settlement agreement had to be written in English. Since 1948, though, the language of the courts had been Hebrew. Our day-to-day precedents were also expressed in the official language. The old English precedents were kept in Jacob Keren’s locked filing cabinet. As both he and his secretary had left for the day, nobody had access to them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 11: The Trial</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/the-luck-of-valentino/part-11/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 18:24:39 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/the-luck-of-valentino/part-11/</guid><description>&lt;p>Some three weeks after our conference with Keren, Hannah and I marched over to our dilapidated court building. Boaz looked well and at ease. In contrast, Omri Tal, who was sitting next to him, appeared nervous, even apprehensive. He was talking in undertone with the singularly attractive girl, who was doing her best to calm him down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Glad to see everybody’s on deck,” said Baruch Shoham, having responded graciously when all of us rose to our feet and bowed as he entered the court room from his chambers. Unlike the attorneys, who continued to wear gowns, the judge’s formal attire comprised a black silk jacket, a white shirt with a stiff collar and a sober tie.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter 11: Peppi's Demise and Funeral</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-devil-in-munich/chapter-11/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 22:35:44 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-devil-in-munich/chapter-11/</guid><description>&lt;p>Peppi did not mention Anna again. Neither did he refer to his will. At our next reunion the sun was shining bright and the breeze was light and soothing. Shortly after I returned to Singapore I found a concise message on my answering machine. Lucy asked me to return her call as soon as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a while I stared apprehensively at the telephone. Snippets of conversations and fleeting images from my encounters with Peppi ran through my mind. When I sensed I was in control of myself, I picked up the receiver and dialled the number I had come to know so well.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter 11: A Posh Kumsits</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/reunion-in-zermatt/chapter-11/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 19:29:20 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/reunion-in-zermatt/chapter-11/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="1-indulgence-and-old-songs">1.

&lt;p>For the next few minutes Pilkin and I watched as the waiter cleared the dishes and smartened the table by brushing the crumbs into a silver tray. After a quick glance at my host, who signified his approval with a nod, he uncorked another bottle of wine and then placed the dessert menu in front of us. Sighing, Pilkin ordered Zimmes, an East European sweet made of carrots. I knew he would have preferred a créme caramel but, after meat, a milk based dish was proscribed for four hours.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter 11: Curtains</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/a-candid-obituary/chapter-11/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2025 13:00:27 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/a-candid-obituary/chapter-11/</guid><description>&lt;p>During my twenty years in Australasia, I had visited Singapore regularly. Adjusting to my new teaching environment was therefore an easy task. News about Ranjan trickled in mainly through Allen, who – unlike Marcus in Melbourne – was an avowed enemy. Marcus had, invariably, viewed Ranjan’s activities supportively. Allen underscored the seedy aspect of what he chose to tell me. He remained unabashed when, on one occasion, I gave vent to my resentment of his bias.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 12: My Departure</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/scaffolding/part-12/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 21:45:50 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/scaffolding/part-12/</guid><description>&lt;p>During the next few days in Tel Aviv I attended emigration procedures. In the evenings, I skimmed through many of my old books. It soon became clear that my literary tastes had remained largely intact. Both Kafka and Joyce remained high on my priorities list. The main change was my migration from Hebrew to English. The latter had become my natural, even if acquired, medium of communications.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mother and I arrived in the airport well before the estimated boarding time. To my surprise, we ran into Ruth Schwartz. Having seen off a VIP, she was getting ready to take a bus back to Tel Aviv. Ruth, who knew that mother’s Hebrew was poor, greeted us in German.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 12: Final Reflection</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ravages-of-a-guillotine/part-12/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 19:04:40 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ravages-of-a-guillotine/part-12/</guid><description>&lt;p>To put the drafting committee at ease, I rang to let them know I was on my way. It turned out that the precedents in my hand were no longer needed. Jacob Keren’s secretary had gone back to the office to pick up a parcel she had left behind. With her assistance, they located the old precedents.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I was no longer in a hurry, I decided to drop into David Misrachi’s eatery. I had been too nervous to take a proper lunch before the meeting. I was hungry but it was getting too late to have dinner before the show to which Rachel and I were going.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 12: Meanderings During the Recess</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/the-luck-of-valentino/part-12/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 18:24:41 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/the-luck-of-valentino/part-12/</guid><description>&lt;p>As soon as the judge left the Courtroom, Boaz departed in the company of Omri and his attractive fiancée. Hannah left in a hurry, mumbling she had to report to Ruth Schwartz. Fearing David Mizrachi’s eatery would be crowded, I crossed the road to a nearby sandwiches and coffee bar. Munching away, I started to soliloquise about the events of the morning and about the legal fraternity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My years with Jacob Keren’s firm convinced me that law and drama coincided mainly in films and in poorly written books. Undoubtedly, every trial had had its tense and often unpredictable moment. But I had never seen a witness crumbling in the box and coming up with a tearful confession. Most trials were less momentous than the Omri Tal case. Victory was secured by careful preparation, sound tactics and skilful arguments. On many occasions the final result was dictated by sheer luck.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter 12: Anna's Revelation</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-devil-in-munich/chapter-12/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 22:36:31 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-devil-in-munich/chapter-12/</guid><description>&lt;p>Anna and Otto were waiting for us in the sitting room. I was struck by Anna’s appearance. The middle-aged woman who got up to meet us bore little resemblance to the charming little girl and vivacious teenager whose captivating smile livened up Peppi’s family album. I was put off by her severe expression, her firm mouth and her eyes – eyes devoid of mirth. Otto, in contrast, appeared friendly and well balanced and his eyes were warm.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter 12: Post Mortem</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/reunion-in-zermatt/chapter-12/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 19:51:32 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/reunion-in-zermatt/chapter-12/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="1-bushis-analysis">1.

&lt;p>“Well, Bushi” said Pilkin when the glasses were empty, “it’s good to know that entre nous we’re still Bushi and Pilkin: never mind about that Professor Dr. Berger and the Rabbi Zohar stuff. So we have weathered the years! But now we have to turn to the awkward part of our reunion: the post mortem. You remember: we agreed to have it!”&lt;/p>

&lt;p>“Well,” he said benignly, “I hope everybody had a pleasant lunch?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Thank you, Judge,” Hannah assured him on behalf of all present.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“And have you had any discussion about a suitable figure?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“We are still rather apart, Judge,” volunteered Hannah. “I believe both parties would like to have your view on the matter.”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter 13: Theophil's Outlook</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-devil-in-munich/chapter-13/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 22:37:12 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-devil-in-munich/chapter-13/</guid><description>&lt;p>On my last day in London, I had an early breakfast and, following a pleasant stroll on Hampstead Heath, decided to have a last browse in Kensington Church Street. Leaving the train at Notting Hill Gate, my feet soon led me to Theophil’s Antiques.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lucy had concluded the negotiations forthwith. The new owners transferred the stock in trade to one of their shops and removed the furniture. The building, which was to be put on the market following refurbishment, looked desolate. Gone were the tapestries, the illuminated books, the silver, the glass and the porcelain displayed in the show windows. The vacant rooms and bare floors, visible through the panes, announced ‘empty’. The signboard alone bore witness to the fact that this barren shell had once housed one of London’s famed antiques stores.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter 13: Finale</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/reunion-in-zermatt/chapter-13/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 19:53:04 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/reunion-in-zermatt/chapter-13/</guid><description>&lt;p>Next morning I packed my suitcase, went for a walk and then had a light breakfast. When I stepped back into the lobby, the receptionist told me the room facing the Matterhorn was ready. After I settled in it, I took Pilkin’s gift out of the spacious pocket of my parka. Was it a paper knife or some other small Bezalel artefact? First to be revealed was a fine chamois sachet. Inside it was a velvet sheath, neatly tied with a maroon lace. When I opened it, my hand started to tremble. I was holding in my hand an exquisite religious object, delicately crafted in silver: a Mezuzah, traditionally mounted on the door post of Jewish homes in remembrance of the Exodus myth. Smilingly, I recalled the Mezuzah that had been displayed on front door of my parents’ home in Tel Aviv. It, too, was a fine piece, but not of the same quality as the work of art I admired this morning.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 14: Post Mortem</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/the-luck-of-valentino/part-14/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 18:29:01 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/the-luck-of-valentino/part-14/</guid><description>&lt;p>Eager to make her report to Ruth Schwartz, Hannah left straightaway. Boaz and I spent some time drafting the settlement document and then walked back together, wadding our way through the thin, aggravating, drizzle. As if by agreement, we dropped into David Mizrachi’s eatery. Lunch time was long over but both of us felt the need for a cup of his strong brewed aromatic coffee.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“What was that odd crack about Shalom Cohen?” I asked as I wiped the raindrops off my face. “I didn’t know Hannah and Omri had common friends?”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter 14: The Pact</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-devil-in-munich/chapter-14/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 22:40:41 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-devil-in-munich/chapter-14/</guid><description>&lt;p>For a while we remained silent. He was watching me closely. I contemplated him with admiration. Despite his unappealing appearance I was mesmerised by his bright eyes. True, they looked straight through me and read my thoughts effortlessly and accurately, stripping me of all pretence. All the same, I sensed their warmth and was captivated by the understanding they reflected. I knew I was facing a being superior to me and realised I was in the presence of an intellect that dwarfed mine. Nonetheless, I was overcome by an intense feeling of brotherhood.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Part 15: Planning Our Future</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/the-luck-of-valentino/part-15/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 18:29:03 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/the-luck-of-valentino/part-15/</guid><description>&lt;p>“Well Eli,” said Boaz after a short lull. “This is a good a time to bring up a point I wanted to raise with you for a while. As you say: Keren’s firm isn’t paradise; ditto for Israel Silver’s outfit. Why don’t we make ourselves independent?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Start a new practice? There are some two hundred law firms in Tel Aviv?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Even so, don’t you think we can make it? We had good training; and we’ve worked well together as a team in law school!”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter 15: Aftermath</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-devil-in-munich/chapter-15/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 22:41:20 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-devil-in-munich/chapter-15/</guid><description>&lt;p>The driver of the van and his mate dismantled Peppi’s desk unceremoniously, hauled its three parts down the lift and returned for the armchair and stool. The former smacked his lips appreciatively as he reinserted the cork into the neck of the bottle of Slivovitz which I had asked him to take away with him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a while I wandered through the empty rooms, scenes from my many encounters with Peppi and Lucy racing through my mind. It was only after I had pulled the front door shut that I noticed it was raining heavily. Instantly, I realised that I had left my umbrella in the stand in the entrance hall. Looking around me anxiously for cover, my mind strayed to Theophil. At the very same moment I heard a sharp sound and turned to see my umbrella hanging from the door handle. Had the men put it there?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Epilogue</title><link>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/a-candid-obituary/epilogue/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2025 13:03:25 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/a-candid-obituary/epilogue/</guid><description>&lt;p>A few years later, Ranjan’s sad end was vividly drawn back to my attention. One day I received an email in which the sender, who signed himself as Chula Jeyaratne, asked me for lunch. Initially, I was unable to identify him. I then recalled that I had met Ranjan’s younger brother, whose name was Chula, during my first visit to Colombo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The man in his late middle age, who had arrived at the agreed venue before me, bore no resemblance to that unformed boy I had met years earlier. His black hair was laced with silver and his face was wrinkled.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
