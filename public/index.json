[{"content":"1. First Hearing in an Alternative Dimension Nonplussed, I looked at the panel of three hovering above me. The Chairman looked exactly as He had been depicted by Michelangelo: heavy set, energetic and very much in command. His eyes, though, were kindly and a ghost of a twinkle was discernible. The adjudicator sitting to His right wore the uniform of a judge of the Court of Appeal, including a wig; his tall and gaunt figure commanded respect and his solemn expression and demeanour made me shiver. My lifelong friend, Theophil, was sitting to the Chairman’s left. As I turned my eyes to him, he winked, as if to say: “Don’t worry, Peter’le.”\nI was aware that monotheistic religions regarded him as Satan, as Ashmadeus and as the epitome of evil. My association with him convinced me that these creeds misjudged him. Doubtless, he often exposed hypocrisies or ‘ulterior motives’, just as he purported to do in the case of Job. In general, though, he was not an interventionist. Frequently, the Almighty took his counsel, especially when it concerned the elevation of incumbents of purgatory to a place in paradise. All in all, Theophil struck me as resembling the Greek Pan rather than Hades – the severe and merciless master of the underworld.\n“I agree with Matey,” volunteered the Almighty. “You, Peter’le, need not be alarmed.”\n“I understand. But – Dear God – why am I here? I thought I had a pact to merge with Theophil?”\n“You will. But there is a fine point to be settled. Gabriel will explain.”\n“You see, Mr. Peter: pacta sunt servanda, which means: bargains are to be honoured. So, within a reasonable time, you will become united with Theophil. But before the bargain is complete, we – your judges – must consider your case.”\n“But why?”\n“That’s the law,” Gabriel told me severely.\n“It is, rather,” muttered Theophil, “and as we know: the law is an ass!”\n“My poor donkey,” complained the Good Lord. “If he is such a useless object, why have I created him?” Turning to Theophil, he added: “And you, Matey, didn’t counsel me to stop!”\n“But who says the ass is useless? A bit of stupidity is often no worse than a wealth of conventional wisdom,” replied my lifelong friend.\n“You have a point there,” agreed the Good Lord, ignoring Gabriel’s angry look.\nThe proceedings struck me as a sham. My decision to join the ranks of the Archangel – my friend Theophil – had been made long before my demise. Clearly, neither the Chairman nor Gabriel was going to declare the pact void. So why did they trouble to congregate? Did it really matter whether my bargain with Theophil was to be carried out instantly or after some delay?\nThe law, I knew, was an ass. In contrast, the three members of my panel were wise. Why would they adhere to mete out an obscure decree? It made no sense, especially for them.\n“It is not as simple as that,” explained Gabriel, who read my thoughts. “Our task is to do justice before it is too late. Once you are part of Theo, this becomes impossible.”\n“Are you then thinking of sending me for a short spell to hell?”\n“Heavens forbid,” interposed the Good Lord.\n“I agree,” nodded Gabriel. “All in all, you led a pretty decent life.”\n“Did I?”\n“Your main sins are your failure to respect or accept Him and the many instances of unkindness you have shown to your poor wife. Further, you bored your students to tears!”\n“Anything else?” I enquired anxiously.\n“You told plenty of white lies and, my dear Peter, you blew up your ‘expenses’ in your income tax returns.”\n“Once upon a time, Gabriel was employed by the Inland Revenue Department,” grinned Theophil.\n“Must have been a terrible experience, Lord Gabriel,” I said humbly.\n“No need for the ‘Lord’ or any other human-coined title: ‘Gabriel’ will do. But no, it wasn’t a bore. This experience taught me a great deal about modern humans and their cultures.”\n“Are all of us crooks?”\n“Not really, Peter’le,” relented Gabriel, “but all humans I’ve come across are capable of ‘little dishonesties’ and have a selective approach to morals.”\n“Are you then leaving these irregularities out of my indictment, Gabriel?”\n“If my Honourable Colleagues agree,” he retorted as the other two panellists nodded.\nThis meant that my main fault had been my rejection of Him and the acts of unkindness Gabriel referred to. All in all, none appeared heinous. The sentence ought to be light. Still, I had a problem with the indictment.\n“I never denied His existence,” I pleaded my defence.\n“Right you are,” nodded Gabriel. “But did you accept Him? Did you worship Him?”\n“No, I didn’t. But, then, look at it from my viewpoint. How could I accept His existence when I doubted the very meaning of ‘existence’?”\n“He raised the issue of ‘existence’ with me,” confirmed Theophil.\n“We, too, keep pondering on it,” grinned the Good Lord. “Here let me show you!”\nTo my amazement, he transformed himself into a swan, into Jupiter, into the Shaman and, at long last, into an invisible cloud. Gabriel, in turn, changed himself into a haughty angel with a beak and wings.\n“But, then, even a cloud ‘exists’. What do you really appear like?” I asked\n“If anyone of us showed you his home-image, you wouldn’t see, hear or sense anything. Even the most powerful microscope, hearing-aid or computer-radar would be of no use,” explained the Good Lord patiently.\n“I told him that,” asserted Theophil. “He didn’t press the point.”\n“But, all the same, I would like to know. Obviously, I can’t provide the answer on my own. But surely, you, Good Lord, are in the know!”\n“It ain’t that simple,” interposed Gabriel. “Tell me, Peter’le, does a dream exist?”\n“Depends on what you mean by ‘exist’,” I replied.\n“So you really ask Him to provide an answer to a question that is unclear! And how can any being answer an unformulated query?”\nThe Good Lord agreed benignly: “Spot on. My Matey (whom Gabri calls Theo) is of the same view.”\n“But, Dear God, why is my failure to accept your ‘existence’ a sin when I am, to your knowledge, unable to fathom the meaning of ‘exist’?”\n“So that’s why you have adopted him,” muttered the Good Lord, with his gaze fixed on Theophil.\n“He has a penchant for raising awkward questions,” explained Theophil.\n“Tut, tut,” interposed Gabriel. “To hear is to obey! So this ‘existence’ analysis is a red herring.”\n“Nonetheless, I never addressed Him directly,” said the Good Lord.\nAfter a short reflection, I spotted the heart of the problem. The Good Lord – if He existed – gave mankind free choice. If He addressed us directly or gave any orders, free choice would be mockery. So He considered it best not to appear to us.\nMy meanderings did not shed light on the meaning of ‘existence’. That remained a grey area to humanity. Had They discovered the answer?\n“No: we do not have an all-embracing solution. Perhaps ‘existence’ encompasses different notions,” said my life long friend with conviction.\n“I know you ‘exist’, Theophil.”\n“You mean ‘we’ exist. But you doubted the notion for a long time. In the end I gave in to the human Peter’le and revealed myself to him. Luckily, he didn’t burst a vessel.”\n“I never drop my mask! I let you search for me,” summed up the Good Lord.\n“Then, Good Lord, we ‘indict’ our Peter’le for not searching,” Gabriel came to life.\n“I am afraid so. And also for the other matters you listed,” He conceded.\n“You won’t send me to hell for these?” I pressed anxiously.\n“Of course not. Yours are sins or perhaps misdemeanours. Hell is for real felons!” Gabriel spoke on behalf of the panel.\nAs I kept looking at them, it dawned on me that They, too, were still searching for answers. There was no basis for the assumption that They, or in the very least He Himself, had mastered all knowledge in the universe. In a sense, my realisation baffled me. If He created the universe, how could it hold onto its mysteries?\n“You, Peter’le, assume that my creation was a wilful act, don’t you?”\n“I do. That’s what I’ve been told in school. But, then, the teachers taught us a lot of rubbish.”\n“They did, rather,” interposed Theophil. “We do not know whether creation or evolution was triggered off wilfully or by chance.”\n“This means that there may be a further dimension above yours?”\n“We can’t rule that out,” volunteered Gabriel.\n2. Provisional Sentence Most of the pieces in the jigsaw had now been placed. But where were they going to send me? Hell had been ruled out. As I was a sinner, heaven was also not on. In any event, it was out of bounds for one of Theophil’s admirers.\nWould I, then, have to spend a spell in purgatory prior to my full merger with Theophil? And to which ward might I be destined? Hopefully, not to the Ward of Bores. The very thought passed a shiver through my dematerialised spine.\n“Don’t be childish, Peter’le. That ward has many sophisticated incumbents. They simply said one thing too often. You have plenty to learn from them. But, no, the Ward of Bores is not your destination. True, you used one phrase – letter of credit – too often. But you are not in the same league as Plato, St. Augustine, Kant and Marx. No, Peter’le, you will be destined to a place determined by Theophil,” explained Gabriel.\n“Your task, Peter’le, will be to punch noses of deserving humans,” supplemented Theophil.\n“What do you mean by ‘deserving’?” I wanted to know.\n“Individuals who left a lasting mark on humanity and its development,” explained the Good Lord.\n“But I have never punched a nose in my life,” I protested.\n“True,” nodded Theophil. “But once you told me you wanted to punch Dean Schwitz at Monash. So that gave us the idea. You see, Peter’le, that’s how your sins rebound on your own head.”\n“Poor noses,” I wailed.\n“We disagree. Your selection is bound to please them: you shall make them feel important. Further, some of you humans get great pleasure from being beaten, tortured or cross-examined by the tax authorities. The disease is called masochism,” lectured Gabriel.\nSo my task was to punch seven selected noses. Still, one detail remained to be settled. Where would I spend the in-between spells? For just a second, I feared they would induce Theophil to tie me to a mast in a space ship.\n“We are not barbarians. Only a demented Teutonic mind could dream up such nonsense. And we don’t expect any woman to fall madly in love with you. You don’t qualify,” said the Good Lord in alarm.\n“But then, where will I reside when I am not busy punching?”\n“Matey – I mean, your friend Theophil – will take care of the arrangements. And don’t you make a mistake. You can punch any human being: male or female. We are not male chauvinist pigs,” clarified the Good Lord.\n“But suppose I want to punch somebody who may not have existed – like Moses?”\n“As far as this exercise is concerned, existence encompasses everybody in your memory banks: even David and Ivanhoe,” explained Gabriel.\n“And the outcome?” I wanted to know.\n“We shall reconvene after you have punched seven noses. If we are satisfied with the performance, you are free to unite with Matey,” explained the Good Lord.\n“And if you are not satisfied?”\n“You have to punch another seven noses. It could turn into a perpetuum mobile,” grinned Theophil.\n3. Temporary Accommodation “Why did you let this happen?” I asked my mentor when the other two members of the panel disappeared.\n“Gabriel is a nit-picker. But we’ll turn the episode to our advantage.”\n“How?” I wanted to know.\n“You’ll be a guest in my favourite ward. With His consent I established it to accommodate Archie – Archimedes Man of Syracuse – and Moti the Mammoth. They preferred to remained united rather than be moved to their respective heavens. A third incumbent – a Tiger – accepted an invitation to join them. I visit this ward regularly. Still, you’ll have to gain the inhabitants’ confidence on your own. Here is the hidden door.”\nThe garden was beautiful. I was fascinated by the skilfully trimmed shrubs, the neatly mowed lawn, the river flowing with dignity and the majestic view of mountains in the distance. The climate was warm and pleasant and the sky was blue and clear.\nThe tiger, the mammoth and their companion – a tall lanky fellow – looked stunned as I entered. The tiger arched his back, gave me a furious look and stepped protectively in front of the mammoth. The latter got the lanky fellow out of imminent danger. Having lifted the chap up with his trunk, the mammoth placed him in a picturesque hut erected on the mammoth’s own back. The mammoth then stepped forward in my direction.\nFor a moment I was overcome by trepidation. Then, to my relief, the tiger relaxed and, unexpectedly, observed: “You were sent to us by Lord Pan.”\n“Lord Pan? And how come you speak English?”\n“This is simple. Greek, of course, is the only civilised language,” interposed the lanky fellow, sliding down the mammoth’s trunk and holding his hand out to me. “All other languages are barbaric: especially Latin. Greek, though, is an ancient language. Many modern words were coined long after Classical Greek ceased to be spoken. For this reason, Lord Pan chose English. And he has made the dwellers of this ward conversant in it.”\nI looked with interest at the circles of hyperbolas and parabolas this fellow had drawn on the sand. When my thoughts cleared, I told him with confidence: “So you are really Archimedes, Man of Syracuse!”\n“I am indeed. But all my friends know me as ‘Archie’. And this big fellow is Moti.”\n“You are the biggest fellow I’ve come across. You are huge. But you are also cute – if you know what I mean.”\nTo my delight, Moti raised his trunk and trumpeted. Spontaneously, all of us clapped. Acknowledging the ovation, Moti beamed at us.\n“It is an honour to meet you,” I assured the three of them. “But who is Lord Pan?”\n“It’s me,” said Theophil and materialised in front of us. “That’s the cliché I use when I come to see them here. Well, Peter’le, what do you think of your haven?\n“Magnificent, Maestro!”\n“You’ll be happy here. And you have the option of staying on as long as you like. Just keep punching the wrong noses.” Turning to the three residents, he explained: “Peter’le is my friend. Please help him to plan his mission. He’ll tell you all about it.”\nBefore Theophil exited, Tiger brushed gently against his robe. Theophil, in turn, stroked him. Archie and Moti beamed at both of them. I took the scene in with admiration. I knew that Eden was elsewhere. Still, this lovely spot had a charm of its own.\n4. Settling Down “Well, what is your mission? If it’s got anything to do with mathematics, you’re in the right place,” announced Archie somewhat immodestly.\n“I’m afraid it’s got nothing to do with math. I’ve got to punch noses of people who have left a mark on humanity!”\n“I’ve got no nose; only a trunk. Try to punch it, Peter’le. You’ll break your hand.”\n“Sorry, Moti: only human noses are eligible: male and female.”\n“But do you really want to punch female noses?” asked Tiger. “Most boys like to do other things with girls!”\n“That’s because they are dumb,” interjected Archie. “They think they take whilst being taken. But Peter’le, how are you going to select these noses. Seven out of infinity: quite a task!”\nArchie’s point was crucial. I could think of hundreds, if not thousands, of noses deserving a punch, including many religious worthies. The difficulty was to nominate, or select, just seven. Worse still, both males and females were eligible. On what criteria was I to base my selection?\n“You’ve got to be objective. If your panel detects a bias, you’ll have an encore. Actually, why don’t you stand on a stage and invite anybody who wishes to have his or her nose punched to put in an appearance?” asked Tiger.\n“I don’t think we’ll have seven acceptances – even if we add an RSVP,” I told him.\n“Right you are, Peter’le. We must pick objective criteria to help us select worthy noses. To start with you must have a representative of each major culture. And make sure there are enough male and female noses online,” advised Archie.\nFor the rest of the afternoon we discussed appropriate criteria. Race and age were discarded. The former was ill-defined and confusing; the latter was immaterial: most of the eligible candidates were long dead. An important criterion was pinpointed by Tiger. Punching had to be carried out in a chronological order. I ought to find a suitable candidate in each major epoch.\n“But where shall I start? I could start with our own age and move backward or commence at the beginning.”\n“Start at the beginning,” counselled Archie. “If you begin selecting noses from amongst your contemporaries you’ll be overwhelmed by the number of suitable candidates.”\nLate in the evening Theophil put in another appearance. To start with he commended our research. He then arranged a suitable resting place for me. Having decided not to erect another hut on Moti’s back, he simply magnified the size of Tiger’s carpet and provided a pillow and blankets.\n“Please act as Peterle’s guardian, Tiger’le.”\n“I sure will,” Tiger assured Theophil. “Can I accompany him on his missions?”\n“Of course,” said Theophil magnanimously. “When necessary, I’ll shrink you to an appropriate size.”\nNext morning I woke up full of energy. I wanted to embark on the task given to me. Still, the lovely stream was appealing.\n“I want to have a swim before breakfast,” I told Tiger.\n“I’ll accompany you to the riverbank. But I don’t like to immerse myself in water,” muttered Tiger.\n“I won’t be long,” I promised, thinking to myself that Tiger retained his prejudices even after his physical demise. It then dawned on me that the very same point applied to me. I had always liked to swim in the morning. In addition, I felt for Tiger the same fondness I used to have for cats.\nShortly afterwards I asked the three of them to help me plan my course. I was satisfied that He had greater influence on humanity than any mortal. Should I then place him at the head of the queue?\n“I thought your task was to punch human noses,” observed Archie. “Is He then eligible?”\n“Archie means to ask: is he human?” augmented Moti.\n“Quite so,” confirmed the Man of Syracuse.\nTiger, who sat apart, nodded. It dawned on me that, in a sense, Archie and Moti were closer to one another than to Tiger. I recalled that Tiger was admitted to the ward long after Theophil had erected it so as to enable Archie and Moti to remain together rather than moving each to his respective paradise. Tiger was a newcomer and accordingly had remained an add-on incumbent. Effectively, my arrival moved him closer to the centre.\nSeeking to concentrate on the point raised by Archie, I stroked Tiger’s rich fur. He, in turn, purred with satisfaction and brushed against my trousers.\n“A big cat,” I thought. “Fiercely independent but willing to make friends.”\nTurning to Archie, I mused: “Surely, the answer to your comment is complex. It depends on the religion you embrace.”\n“Please explain,” said Moti. “You see, we mammoths do not postulate any faith. We are tolerant.”\n“Well, most Pagan religions are anthropomorphic so that Jupiter, for instance, has a nose. Buddhists, too, worship a human being. In contrast, Islam and Judaism maintain that the Almighty has no human features. Christianity is less clear on this point. Their Almighty came down to earth disguised as his own son and, for that purpose, assumed human form. During his spell with us he had a nose. But after his crucifixion he was resurrected and merged again with the formless Holy Spirit.”\n“Peter’le,” said Theophil, who emerged in front of our eyes, “you ought to raise this difficult legal (or philosophical) question as a preliminary or interlocutory issue with our panel. I’ll ask Gabri – the Keeper of Records – to convene a meeting.”\n5. A Preliminary Issue Respecting Eligibility My three new friends accompanied me to the session. Each of us was formally dressed. To my amusement, Moti wore a huge bowtie. Was it organised by Archie, I wondered? In contrast, the three members of the panel donned comfortable attire and appeared relaxed.\nAfter listening to our arguments, He took the lead: “Surely, Peter’le, Michelangelo drew me as a mighty figure with human features.”\n“True; but then, can we trust him? Didn’t he use his artistic freedom (or licence) and imagination?” asked Tiger.\n“Also, all Renaissance maestros set out to impress. Theirs was not the power of pure reason,” pontificated Archie.\n“Hear, hear!” exclaimed Moti.\n“Furthermore, their efforts would be in line with just one sect of Christianity: Catholicism,” I put in.\n“We should be able to clarify the point after a short break,” concluded Theophil on behalf of the panel.\nWhen they reconvened, Gabriel delivered their unanimous judgment. My mandate was confined to punching human noses. It was for me to decide whether a given deity met with this criterion and, of course, had to consider if activities and standing brought Him or Her within the range of the seven suitable worthies.\nInitially, I felt disappointed. In reality, the decision threw the issue back to me.\n“Actually, we didn’t,” said Theophil who joined us on the way back to our haven. “We simply left the onus on you. You must make your own choices and we shall judge whether or not you have completed your task. If we decide you haven’t, then you get an encore. Surely, that’s a fine solution.”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novels/nose-puncher/part-1/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"1-first-hearing-in-an-alternative-dimension\"\u003e1.

Monotheistic religions as well as folklore see in him the epitome of evil or, in other words, regard him as wicked per se.\nMy stories display Theophil in a very different light. Far from being treated either as ‘good’ or as ‘evil’, he is staged as an Adviser or Vizier, on whose advice the ‘Good Lord’ often relies (just as he did in the Book of Job).\nTheophil has powers of his own; but he exercises them sporadically. In general, he is a non-interventionist. Occasionally, though, he drops an appropriate hint in the right quarters. Moreover, from time to time he materialises in front of the eyes of a being of his choice. Usually, those he accepts in this manner become disciples and admirers.\nA complementary function, occasionally performed by Theophil, is the opening of the eyes of people searching for reason. In doing so, he tends to bear in mind that not everybody wishes to see things as they are. Often traditional men (or women) of faith are unwilling to call a spade a spade because they do not care to see it. Materialising to them would be a waste of time. Accordingly, Theophil ignores them.\nTo enhance readability the book is divided into four Parts. Part I (comprising the first five stories, which are narrated by Theophil) deals with events in which I, Peter Berger, play no overt role. In each, Theophil acts in harmony with the Good Lord.\nThe next three Parts, which comprise the remaining eleven stories, are narrated by me (Peter Berger). They reflect actual episodes from my life, reconsidered through Theophil’s lens and philosophic perspective. Part II, comprising stories 6 to 9, relates events which I recalled during my hospitalization in the XX Ward of the National University Hospital following a fainting spell. Part III, comprising stories 10 to 14, deals with events from my own life, on which I focused (with Theophil’s aid) during a period of Sabbatical Leave spent in Oxford.\nThe last Part – Part IV – comprises the remaining two stories. They deal, respectively, with my life following my wife’s demise. The first story, respecting my tour of the Indonesian islands, lampoons the hypocrisy often associated with the orthodox front displayed by pillars of faith. The last story deals with a milestone in my life, exposed by Theophil.\nOriginally, the stories in this collection were self-published under the title Ephemeral Stories, but on further reflection — and with the thoughtful assistance of an AI conversational partner — I decided to change the title to Theophil. While diverse in setting and tone, all emphasise his philosophical musings and interventions and lend coherence to the work. On this basis, I decided to treat the collection as a novel.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novels/theophil/preface/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe common thread running through this book is the effect of the ephemeral being I call Theophil, known to humanity as Satan or Mephisto.

The one usually cited is the Masoretic Text (“MT”) version.\nScholars believe that it was composed during the 5th or early 4th century BCE, that is, before the Hashmonean period. The book is unlikely to have been composed earlier than that. It is true that the issue discussed in it – that is, the theodicy issue – was raised by Jeremiah [Jer. 12:1-3]. However, the 6th century – covering this prophet’s long ministry – witnessed the struggle of Judah with Babylon and the final destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar followed by the exile.\nDuring the next century Nehemiah was active in Jerusalem, which was – at that time – a small and under-populated town.1 It is unlikely that Job was written there during that century BCE. At the same time, philological evidence indicates that the book was written before Greek became the lingua franca of the Levant or, in other words, before the advent of Alexander the Great and the struggle of his successors. Further, Job is renowned for words unique to it. Many of these Hapax Legomena [“Hapxes” for short] are derived from Aramaic or other Semitic languages but not borrowed from Greek.2 This circumstantial evidence suggests that the MT version was composed when Aramaic was the principal language of the Orient but prior to the advent of Greek. In turn, this supports the view that Job was composed either late in the 5th century or early in the 4th BCE.\nIt is questionable whether the MT version is the very first text of Job.3 It is feasible that a previous version was circulated to a limited group. To date, though, no such earlier version has materialised. Further, scraps of the MT’s Hebrew version were discovered amongst the Dead Sea Scrolls in Qumran.4\nThere are also ancient translations of Job into Aramaic and into Greek. The earliest is a translation into Aramaic discovered amongst the Dead Sea Scrolls.5 As this settlement in Qumran was destroyed in 70 CE, the “Qumran Scroll” predates the later Aramaic translation, colloquially referred to as Onkelos.6 Scholars have concluded that the Qumran Scroll’s script is of the Herodian period.7 Regrettably, the Qumran Scroll comprises only about 15 per cent of the book. The later translation into Aramaic, sometimes printed in current Hebrew bibles, was promulgated after the destruction of Jerusalem by Rome (the “late Targum”).8 It is possible that some other translations were composed but were suppressed by Rabban Gamliel.9 Presumably, all these translations were made so as to make Job available to Judean and Diaspora Jews, who were not conversant in Hebrew.10 The same can be said about the Septuagint (“LXX”), that is, the translation of the Old Testament into Greek, which had by then become the lingua franca throughout the Levant. The date of the compilation of the LXX is outside the scope of this investigation. However, the scholarly consensus11 is that it was completed by the end of the first century CE. This is later than the presumed date of the MT version of Job.\nIn the MT, Job is included in the last part, known as the Scriptures – the Ketuvim [כתובים]. In some canons12 Job is treated as a Prophet or as a Historical Book. In the LXX, Job appears after the narrative parts but prior to the prophets.\nAs Job deals with a specific question, viz., divine justice (the “theodicy issue”), rather than with adherence to faith (which is dealt with by the prophets), the MT’s classification is the soundest one. Further, the Scriptures encompass books promulgated later than those of the first two parts of the MT: the Pentateuch and the Prophets. In this way, the MT gives us an indication about a work’s age.\nJob is a difficult book to read.13 Writing in the 12th century,14 Ibn Ezra suggested that Job might have been composed in some other Semitic language and that the MT version was, itself, a translation. Notably, a separate text, entitled The Testament of Job, is included in the Apocrypha,15 which means that, in all probability, it was written well after the compilation of the MT. The Testament manifests a belief in the immortality of the soul and reward in the afterlife.16\nMany books and papers have been written17 with the object of coming to grips with Job’s meaning. The views of Greenstein are of particular guidance. This paper is written because a new overview and ideas based on it are timely.\nAs already noted the MT version is the only complete Hebrew text that has come down to us. Some variations appear in the LXX and in the late Targum.18 The extant manuscripts used for the rendering of the MT date to the 10th century CE and are known, respectively, as the Codex Vaticanus, the Codex Aleppo and the Codex Leningradus.19 Obviously, they are late and, of course, may contain technical copying errors.\nBefore turning to Job’s structure it is important to consider whether or not it constitutes a historical record. The point is controversial. Some sages concluded that the book was an allegory.20 This view appears realistic and finds support in the writing of Maimonides.21 Job’s residence, in the country of Uz [Utz], is thus not to be taken more literally than the reference to Utopia by Thomas More. Still, the reference to Uz shows that the writer thought to place the tome in the Middle East [Kedemקדם ]. This may also explain his attempt to use archaic phrases.\nNotably, this very setting supports the view that Job is a late book. When Jeremiah refers (in the 6th century BCE) to the Babylonian threat, he describes it as emanating from the North, that is, the route showing Mesopotamian armies as traveling along the Euphrates and, accordingly, attacking southwards.

Reading the Decision and Lunch in the Pub My interest in Wiseheart J.’s decision in the now classic case of Masterman Bank v. Seddon arose shortly after I arrived in Oxford in 1959. My object was to write a doctoral thesis on a banking facility known as the ‘commercial letter of credit’, which features in the export and import business. It facilitates international transactions by obtaining a bank’s promise to pay the price of goods. The vendor relies on the bank’s undertaking. The buyer, in turn, knows that the price is to be paid by the bank only if the vendor tenders the prescribed documents. Usually these include a carriage document, such as a bill of lading, evidencing that the goods have been shipped.\nWiseheart J’s decision on the subject had been delivered in 1954. I read it in Oxford’s Bodleian Library. Usually, after a spell of three or four hours in the library, I had my midday repast in a small pub near New College, a few minutes walk from the Law Reading Rooms. I liked its informal atmosphere, the neatly polished oak tables and the old-fashioned chairs. The array of bottles, the draught beer taps and the friendly bar tender – the publican – gave the dimly lit place an ambience of comfort and relaxation.\nThe publican, addressed by his customers as ‘Jack’, came to know me well. Usually, he fixed me a shandy and watched approvingly as I dug into one of his excellent roasts. Occasionally, he treated me to a cup of coffee.\nJack’s mannerism and outlook were unmistakably British. Approachable and affable, he was, all the same, reserved. His pronounced paunch – a beer belly – and a slight limp evidenced that he was well into middle age.\nJack was even tempered, self-assured and cheerful. He was friendly with many of us and treated his regulars as buddies. Some confided in him. I, for instance, told him much about my slowly progressing research. In contrast, Jack kept his own counsel. He seldom spoke about himself.\nFrequently Jack participated in a game of darts. He was an expert and, on many occasions, knocked a successful throw of another player out with his own dart. On such occasions, he smiled with satisfaction but did not sneer. Often he was the winner. His counterparties, though, were not the real losers. Usually, Jack treated us to a round of drinks to celebrate his victory.\n2. Jack’s Stand on my Research Jack showed his concern when I talked to him about the subject of my doctoral thesis. He took the view that both Oxford and its libraries were too remote from the real banking world. There was more to banking than could be discovered in books. With a twinkle in his eyes, he observed that the main difference between bankers and sharks was that the latter did not camouflage their fearsome teeth.\nI remonstrated: “That’s a terrible thing to say, Jack. Where would our capitalist society be without the bankers’ financial skills?”\n“I’ve no idea. But, Peter, banks are no altruists. Sometimes, you want them to carry out a simple instruction and they persuade you to enter into some complex scheme. In the end, they make their profit and you make a loss. I prefer not to use them.”\nI thought it best to ignore Jack’s critical remarks. On one point, though, his view was unexceptional. To study the developments and the effect of letters of credit, I needed contacts in the London banking world. To this end, one of my professors introduced me to G \u0026amp; M, a firm of private bankers in the City. They had been in business for about two hundred years and had an outstanding reputation. More importantly, they had been in the forefront of the letters of credit business right from the start.\n3. Meeting London Bankers and Their View About a Recent Decision Some two weeks after my topic was approved by Oxford’s Board of Studies, I went down to London to call on the Head of G \u0026amp; M’s International Trade Department. Their imposing building, with its fine arched entrance gate and discreet ambience, appeared miles apart from the noisy premises of run of the mill London banks.\nThe officer I called on, Dennis Gray, was a sparse Englishman, whose reserved mannerism, observant and shrewd eyes and his cleanly shaved face commanded respect. He was a typical member of the upper strata of English bankers: discreet, observant, reliable and down to earth.\nFor a while we talked about my research project. Gray was familiar with the existing legal textbooks on letters of credit. He wondered what had induced me to tackle the subject. Was it not a dead-end topic? He nodded his approval when I observed that the existing books were out of date.\nGray mentioned that few cases came up for decision in recent years. These indicated that the developments in current practice obviated disputes but that, nevertheless, our era was the lull before the storm. Problems were bound to surface when new players got into the system.\n“Have you read Wiseheart J’s decision in Masterman Bank v. Seddon?” he asked me.\n“I spotted it after I came over to England, Mr Gray.”\n“What do you think of the judgment?”\n“A fine decision! How could Wiseheart have reached any other conclusion?”\nFor a moment, Gray looked away. “On the facts presented to him, he couldn’t. But many aspects of the case did not come to light.”\n“Oh,” I said, startled.\n“Well, Mr. Berger: the underlying contract was for ‘Grade A Yasmin Tea’. The price agreed upon was higher than the retail price of such tea in London shops. Isn’t it strange that Seddon agreed to pay the exporter such a high price?”\n“It is. Actually, there is no reference to this point in the judgment. Was it raised before the judge?”\n“No: it wasn’t. And the transaction strikes me as fishy,” Gray spoke firmly.\n“I’ll try to dig into it,” I volunteered.\nBefore I left, Dennis Gray told me the Bank would help me in my research work. He, on his part, wanted to be kept informed about my insights on Seddon’s case. Although G \u0026amp; M were not involved in this matter, the case was of interest to them. They, too, had customers trading with Chinese counterparties via Hong Kong.\n4. Jack’s View Respecting the Case Shortly after I went back to Oxford, I discussed my visit with Jack, the publican. In accord with my training as a lawyer, I refrained from mentioning the names of the parties, describing them as Mr. X and the Z Bank, and, as a matter of extra caution, did not mention the nature of the goods involved in the transaction.\nInitially, Jack looked startled but within a few second his expression cleared. Having listened attentively to my detailed account, he was pleased that I had managed to established contacts with the English banking world.\n“One point puzzles me,” I told Jack. “Why should our Mr. X try to get his money back from the Z Bank? At his request, they opened the letter of credit. Didn’t he seek to bite the hand that fed him?”\nAfter a short reflection, Jack summed up: “It all depends on what took place when he discussed his business with the Z Bank’s staff in charge. Suppose the use of a letter of credit was their idea? Banks like your G \u0026amp; M may explain all details to Mr. X. But did the Z Bank?”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/worthless-goods/part-1/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"1-reading-the-decision-and-lunch-in-the-pub\"\u003e1.

Thomas Aung, who still ran his legal practice although he was close to eighty, wanted my advice on the payment of fraudulently drawn cheques. As I now had ample time on my hands I agreed to discuss the case with him on the next day.\nThe facts that unfolded during our conversation raised my eyebrows. The victim, a Mr. Lim who died at the ripe age of 92, had migrated to Singapore from China early in the 20th century. A poorly educated man, who had never mastered English, he succeeded to build up a reasonably prosperous sweetmeats business. Naturally, he needed a current cum savings account and, eventually, opened it with a bank that had a branch near to his enterprise. Being unable to sign his name in Latin characters, he used his Chinese signatures and a rubber stamp (a ‘chop’) setting out the name of the business.\nHe maintained his account with the same branch for many years, although his original bank had been taken over by another local bank. Being a smart entrepreneur, he arranged to have a special rate of interest paid to him on a monthly basis. He did not give a power of attorney – or drawing rights – to anybody. Further, he did not trust his three sons. The only person he gave a glimpse into the details of the account was the adopted daughter of the oldest son.\nThat adopted granddaughter, one Lena, was always present when Mr. Lim drew a cheque. Usually, she inserted the details in English, entered the details of the cheque in Chinese characters in an account book, and watched how Mr. Lim signed the cheques. She then attached to each cheque the rubber stamp and arranged for its dispatch.\nLena had a somewhat unusual life. She fell in love with a married man, shacked up with him and gave birth to two children. Initially, she got a salary from Mr. Lim for the execution of her secretarial duties. But when she moved out of the family home, she ceased to work for him. Instead, she got a job with an international bank. During it she became familiar with general banking practices and, in particular, with the clearing of cheques.\nMr. Lim could not do without Lena’s assistance. Accordingly, it was arranged that she work for him on a part time basis, coming over to his house either before going over to her post or late in the afternoon. She and the late Mr. Lim became very close and, apparently, he trusted her without reservations.\nRegrettably, the business of Lena’s paramour had its up and downs, getting occasionally virtually insolvent. Quite naturally, he asked for Lena’s financial assistance. Being in love, she obliged.\nHer ploy was simple. Initially, she prepared cheques for Mr. Lim’s signature but left some details in blank. In some cases, she inserted “cash” in the space meant for the payee. In others, she made the cheques payable to her paramour’s firm, raised the amount substantially and did not strike out the words “or bearer” printed on the forms. As time passed, she became increasingly bold. She started to forge Mr. Lim’s signature on blank cheque forms, made the cheques payable to cash and presented them for payment at the Bank’s counter. The employees at the branch paid her cash although some cheques were for amounts well above $150,000. They decided to comply with her requests as she was well known and, further, as the manager was aware of her banking background.\nTo hide her tracks, she entered false details in Mr. Lim’s account book. Further, each month, the bank’s genuine statements of Mr. Lim’s account were removed from the letter box and substituted by forged statements. These were neatly prepared and tallied with Mr. Lim’s expectations. He was further assured by Lena’s advice that all was well.\nThe frauds came to light when the bank did not settle Mr. Lim’s monthly electricity bill. When he called the branch manager, he was told the account had a zero balance. When Mr. Lim and his sons confronted Lena, she broke down and confessed. She ended up with a sentence of four years in prison.\nMr. Lim was shocked by the discovery of the real facts. Shortly thereafter, he had a heart attack which, partly due to his age, proved fatal. The heirs – the estate – demanded that the Bank reverse the unauthorized debit entries. Upon the Bank’s refusal they took the matter to court.\nOn the face it, the pleadings assumed the ordinary form. The estate claimed that the bank had to reverse debit entries incurred without the authority expressed in a genuinely signed cheque. The Bank averred that the late Mr. Lim had assisted the perpetration of the frauds by his failure to exercise control over Lena. In addition, the Bank relied on a clause in the terms and conditions which, they averred, applied to the case. Under this ‘verification clause’ Mr. Lim could not rely on any error or inaccuracy of any entry in the bank’s statement, unless he notified it to the Bank within 15 days.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ingenius-fraud/part-1/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eShortly after retiring  from my post as a legal consultant, I received a telephone call from an old friend in arms.

Bank called to tell me that he was coming over with Frederic Steiner (nicknamed ‘Freddie’), the Bank’s compliance officer.\nThe Bank was an important client of our firm. Further, Norbert and Freddie were friends of mine. This, of course, did not mean they were in one another’s good books. Despite their ostensibly amiable modus operandi, it was easy to spot the underlying antipathy. I had had pleasant luncheons with each. But never had they called on me together.\nOur law firm had its premises in downtown Singapore. The walk from the Bank to the firm would take about five minutes. Whilst Norbert and Freddie were on their way, I reflected on their backgrounds and their respective posts.\nBefore he became a banker, Norbert Schneider had been an antiques dealer in Frankfurt. He opened his business shortly after graduating from a well-known German university. He specialised in prints and ceramics. Regrettably, the business did not thrive. In the early seventies, Norbert closed it down and joined a well-known German bank. Before long he revealed a talent for recovering “bad loans”.\nIn 1990 Norbert took up the post of Head of the Bad Loans Department of the X. Bank’s Singapore office. We met shortly after I retired from my professorship at the Law School of the National University of Singapore and joined a law firm as a consultant.\nThe friendship between Norbert and myself was nourished by our common interest in ceramics and, odd to say, by an understanding based on our respective experiences during the Second World War. Norbert, who was partly Jewish, had remained with his parents in Frankfurt during the Third Reich period. I do not know how they managed to survive. My parents had fled from Vienna and, in due course, migrated to Palestine. I grew up as a predominantly Israeli youth. Still, mother’s influence had directed my mind to German culture, literature and philosophy. All in all, I liked the subjects. So did Norbert.\nUnlike Norbert, Freddie came from pure Aryan stock. His parents, though, were persecuted on political grounds. After the end of WWII, they settled for a while in East Germany but in due course migrated to Australia. Freddie grew up in Sydney but spoke German at home. After obtaining a law degree, he joined one of Australia’s local banks as a trainee. In 1994, when he was in his early thirties, he joined the X. Bank in Singapore as their compliance officer.\nFreddie’s post made him an unpopular figure at the Bank. In this regard, he suffered the fate of most compliance officers. Their task was to expose loopholes or technical errors in bargains, such as the absence of a required signature on a contractual document or a failure to comply with a local Statute. In consequence, a compliance officer often frustrated deals on which an account officer had worked for months. When this occurred, the account office lost his anticipated commission and was unable to list the deal in his annual progress report.\nOften a compliance officer was a thorn in the flesh of the staff dealing with the recovery of bad loans. Their task was to recover outstanding debts by legal means. Frequently, the compliance officer wrecked a settlement by discovering a loophole or an inadequacy. In such cases, the bad loans officer’s inclination was to proceed with the deal despite the irregularity. He hoped for the best. To do his job, the compliance officer had to exercise his veto.\nThis differences in tasks and in business philosophy would have been an adequate ground for the constant tension between Norbert and Freddie. But there were additional reasons for their mutual dislike. Norbert had managed to stay put during the Holocaust. He had remained culturally German. To my delight, he had read Kafka and Heinrich Böll. All in all, though, he remained a conservative and a believer.\nFreddie had grown up as an Australian. His cultural ties with Germany were related to his parents’ home. But they were also cultural. He was attracted by German classical literature and, to my surprise, by the literature of East Germany. He had, for instance, drawn my attention back to Lessing and Kleist – both early nineteenth-century playwrights I tended to ignore – and to Völker Braun, a modern East German writer. Ideologically, Freddie remained a left-winger and an agnostic.\nThese differences in outlook were, I suspect, of limited significance. Both Norbert and Freddie were tolerant men. The main problem related to my two friends’ characters and life philosophy. Norbert was a shrewd conformist. He knew how to handle difficult situations and was always in control of his temper. Freddie, in contrast, was a rebel. Quite often he spoke his mind even when common sense dictated silence. On such occasions Norbert was put off by Freddie’s plain words. Freddie, in turn, was repulsed by Norbert’s “live and let live” philosophy.\nTheir mutual differences did not affect their respective friendships with me. I was about twenty years older than Norbert. Freddie was my junior by some thirty-five years. Despite these age gaps, both found it easy to communicate with me. Lunch or morning coffee with either was never dull. Years of experience at universities and in law practice had taught me tolerance, discretion and, most importantly, to have low expectations in everyday life. I was, for instance, pleasantly surprised when Freddie lent me a rare edition of Kleist’s plays. A fine illustrated edition of Böll’s short stories, given to me by Norbert, has continued to grace my collection. So did a porcelain piece he sneaked out of Dresden before the fall of the iron curtain.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/matter-of-compliance/part-1/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIt was late in the morning when Norbert Schneider, Head of the Bad Loans Department of the X.

Bank landed on my desk just a few weeks before my wife and I migrated back to Singapore. It was the first interesting case referred for my opinion during my nine years in Australia. I was also pleased that it had been sent to me at the advice of Jack Wilson, a former student of my days in Wellington, who was to be the lead Counsel in the case.\nIt pleased me to accept the brief. Still, I had to ask that all the documents respecting the case be sent to my new address in Singapore. I promised Jack Wilson that, upon my arrival at my destination, the case would be given my full attention.\nThe bundles of documents that waited for me in Singapore made me gasp. It would take any legal consultant a few weeks to peruse it meticulously. Strange to say, though, the basic facts were simple. Vollar had retired from his real estate business in Bruges and settled with his family in West Australia. Being too young to opt for full retirement he looked around for suitable business which he could acquire in full or in part. He went through local papers and eventually came across an advertisement of a ‘general business’ that looked for an investor and partner.\nVollar asked his own bank to obtain a reference on that business’ standing. That bank, in turn, sought a reference from that business’ bank and asked that it be conveyed directly to the enquirer.\nThe reference, composed by the relevant branch manager, and read out to Vollar by a clerk stated:\nThe [business’] main outlet is a small department store with a fast foods counter. It is situated in a popular location and has suitable off street parking. It is owned by East European migrants, who are competent managers, run the shop effectively and are patronized by a regular clientele. They have been our customers for some three years and usually have kept well within the limit of the facilities granted to them. We consider them good customers.\nI read the reference several times. Its general tone was, no doubt, favourable. Still, a few significant details were missing. No advice was given as regards the capital or funding of the business or that it was run profitably. Further, the reference suggested that, from time to time, cheques were drawn for amounts beyond the approved overdraft limit. An additional point made me raise my eyes. The business had maintained its account with the relevant bank for just three years. When had the business been established?\nIf I had received a reference of this type about a business in which I considered investing a substantial amount, I would have consulted an accountant or a business adviser. In any event, banks usually communicated their reference orally and disclaimed liability. Did the relevant bank do so in the instant case? After all, the bank rendered the service involved without levying a charge.\nA perusal of the pleadings and legal correspondence gave me a clearer comprehension of the issues. The clerk, who had read out the reference, left the bank a few months later and got married. She gave birth to two sons and became a full time housewife. She had no recollection of the case in question. Still, her own notes agreed with Vollar’s except on one point. Vollar maintained that no exemption of liability had been communicated to him. The clerk stated that it was her practice to add at the end of any reference a formula emphasizing that the reference was given gratuitously and without responsibility on the bank’s part.\nThe branch manager, Bruce Smith, affirmed that he composed the reference from notes readily available to him from the files. He had not investigated the business’ records and maintained, unequivocally, that this was in accord with the bank’s regular practice.\nVollar asserted that he relied on the reference as if it were given by a Belgian bank. Further, on the basis of its favourable tone he had seen no need to consult an accountant or business adviser. He went on to allege that the bank had deceived him. He had not been informed that the owners of the business had been declared bankrupts in South Australia and that one of them – the husband – was imprisoned for contravening Western Australian law. When he had filled in and submitted the local Business Registration Form he had hid the fact that he was an undischarged bankrupt. His wife escaped conviction on a technical ground.\nA further perusal of the documents submitted to me indicated that the branch manager, Bruce Smith, had dealt mainly with the \u0026lsquo;female owner\u0026rsquo;, Rena Katz. There was no shred of evidence to affirm that he – or, indeed, any other of the bank\u0026rsquo;s employees – was aware of the \u0026lsquo;male owner\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rsquo; – Yuri Katz\u0026rsquo;s – conviction and imprisonment.\nThese facts made me reflect. What was the basis of the count respecting deceit? Vollar\u0026rsquo;s lawyers alleged that Bruce\u0026rsquo;s failure to investigate the business\u0026rsquo; position at the time he composed the reference involved gross negligence. Such behaviour was – at law – tantamount to deceit. The Bank denied the allegation and disputed Bruce\u0026rsquo;s duty to investigate. The Bank went on to emphasise that the reference was given without responsibility.\nI concluded that the issues had crystallised. Any further exchange of pleadings would be a waste of time. All the same I was perturbed by one element that emerged from the bundle of documents forwarded to me. Both Vollar\u0026rsquo;s and Bruce\u0026rsquo;s communications were marked by bitterness and anger. In one of his early emails Bruce had told Vollar: “You harp on the nature of bank references in Belgium. I know nothing about those but have followed local practice. You have resided here for some five years. You should have known!” Vollar replied: “I thought Australian banks cared for their customers [sic] as much as Belgian banks. You should have told me that you did not care about my interests.”\nThis objectionable correspondence – an some revolting messages – went on and on for weeks. I was not surprised that Vollar\u0026rsquo;s last note read: “Mr. Smith: I have now placed the matter in the hands of my legal advisers.”\nThe acrimonious tone of these exchanges appeared unusual for seasoned men of business. Both Bruce Smith and Vollar had been trained to control their tempers and words. Why had they lost control in this case? I decided to get to the bottom of it. Naturally, this could not be done from the perusal of documents received in Singapore. I hoped to get a clearer pictures when, a few weeks after my arrival in the City of the Lion, I flew over the Perth.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/matter-of-opinion/part-1/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe brief respecting the action of Maurice Vollar against the M. Bank landed on my desk just a few weeks before my wife and I migrated back to Singapore. It was the first interesting case referred for my opinion during my nine years in Australia. I was also pleased that it had been sent to me at the advice of Jack Wilson, a former student of my days in Wellington, who was to be the lead Counsel in the case.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Part 1: The Brief and Bank Reference"},{"content":"In those days – the late 1960ies – my office was on the first floor of the Victoria University of Wellington’s 19th century building. To get to it from the lobby, I had to enter the corridor leading to the library and pass the guard who asked you not to take your bag into the library. In my case, this rule did not apply.\nI suspected that my office used to be the librarian’s room. Still, for the last ten years it had been the office of the Head of the English and New Zealand Law Department. I got its use when I was constituted a professor at Wellington’s University.\nThe spacious room was well designed. The window had a breathtaking harbour view. I could enjoy it from my desk. A few steps led to the main reading room of the law library. Most of the books I used were stacked on shelves on the mezzanine terraces. These terraces had been constructed by the turn of the 20th century. Originally, the architect installed movable library ladders, which used to go from the ground to the high ceiling. They had been replaced by the current terraces after one of my predecessors had had a bad fall.\nOn this specific morning – early in 1969 – I walked to the library in order to get a book on the sale of goods. I needed it to prepare a reading list for classes to be conducted in the coming teaching semester. To my surprise, the book was not in its place. Was it possible that any one of our students would want to read it during the recess?\nAs I gazed down, my eye caught Robert McBride, one of my professorial colleagues, who appeared to be the only other person in the spacious reading room. Noting my glance, he smiled at me warmly. “Are you, by any chance, looking for Benjamin’s Sale of Goods?”\n“As a matter of fact I am. It’s out of date but still a good source for finding authorities.”\n“I’ll bring it to your office when I’m finished with it. It won’t need it for long.”\nRobert came over some 15 minutes later. Noting my quizzical expression, he explained that he had consulted the book on a point arising in a respect of a brief sent to him by a local law firm. As the book did not provide an answer, he wanted to gauge my reaction. Was a horse a ‘chattel’ as defined in our antiquated Sale of Goods Act? Following some prompting on my part, and some hesitations on his, he narrated to me the facts of the case.\nHis client, one Jack Smith, who was an amateur horse breeder, spotted an interesting item listed in the catalogue of a then forthcoming auction. The catalogue listed as a breeding mare, with a distinguished lineage of racing horses, some five years old. Jack Smith did not have the time needed inspect the items put up for sale. Still, he flew to Auckland to attend the auction. When the horse came up for sale the auctioneer, Douglas Brown, waved a document and advised he had a certificate attesting the mare was ‘with fowl’. Jack Smith entered the ring and had the mare knocked down to him. When he took possession, he realised the she was not carrying. He had paid twice the amount she was worth in this condition.\n“Why do you want to proceed under the Sale of Goods Act, Robert?”\n“The ‘chattel’ was not as described! We have a cause of action if the Act applies.”\n“Any ‘thing’ put up for sale is a chattel within the meaning of the Act. But let us see the catalogue.”\nThe catalogue did not mention anything about the mare being with fowl. Worse still, it included the ordinary exemption clause, found in most auction catalogued and regarded as a common, or boiler-plate clause, to the effect that the sales house did not warrant the accuracy of any description. Would-be participants were invited to inspect the items and to form their own opinion respecting them. And this clause was printed in large bold letters.\n“Don’t tell me Jack Smith did not notice this clause, Robert. No judge will believe him!”\n“But Douglas Brown advised the audience that the certificate was to ‘augment’ the catalogue description.”\n“How much did Jack Smith pay for the bloody horse?”\n“Mare – Peter! He paid $3000 for it.”\nI felt a shock. In those golden days such an amount would enable you to acquire a sound new car. My own Hillman Hunter had cost me considerably less than that.\n“Robert, how can any man spend such a sum without having a look at the goods?”\n“Jack Smith relied on the good name of the sales house. He has known them for years!”\nI understood the point made. I had bid substantial amounts on rare books in reliance on entries in catalogues and advertisements. Naturally, I had had my disappointments. The sums, though, were minute in comparison to the price paid by Jack Smith.\n“What does the sales house say on this point?”\n“They deny that any statement had been made! So does Douglas Brown, who – as I told you – acted as auctioneer that day.”\n“Do you, in the very least, have a copy of the certificate?”\n“No!”\n“Any witnesses?”\n“Nobody is prepared to come forward, especially the under bidders!”\n“So – all in all – it is your client’s word against Douglas Brown’s.”\n“True.”\n“Best of luck then.”\n“How would you rank our chances?”\n“It all turns on a point of fact. Did Douglas Brown make any statement. If you establish the point, then he made a misrepresentation. You do not need the sale of Goods Act! It is a simple case of a negligent misrepresentation. But would the judge take your Jack Smith’s word?”\n“Would you?”\n“I’ll have to see Jack Smith and Douglas Brown on the witness stand. For God’s sake, Robert, cover your own back!”\n“I shall in my acceptance of the instructions.”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/catalogue-description/part-1/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn those days – the late 1960ies –  my office was on the first floor of the Victoria University of Wellington’s  19th century building.

The old viewing gallery, from which you could drop a parcel with black market money to a departing friend, was gone. So were the untidy passages leading from the pandemonium of the main hall to the well guarded and orderly departure gates. The new airport looked smart, tidy and functional. Like most airports I had seen during my years of self-imposed exile, it had an impersonal atmosphere.\nMother was waiting for me just outside the customs area. Her hair had gone white and the wrinkles on her face had multiplied. From a woman in her late middle age, she had metamorphosed into a senior citizen. Still, her smile was unchanged, and her self-confident airs had remained as of old. I was amused to observe how her glance took in my receding hair. She knew, of course, that many men had a similar experience when they were close to thirty.\nWe took the bus to the terminal in Tel Aviv. From there we proceeded home in a taxi. I was too tired to engage in small talk. After a few questions about my health and progress, mother, too, remained silent. Fortunately, we arrived before the atmosphere became oppressive.\nThe old bedroom, in which I had grown up, looked unchanged. The sofa-bed, the small cupboard and the mahogany desk were still there. So was the shelf with my books.\n“It’s all as it used to be, Mamma.”\n“What did you expect? Well, you better wait here while I warm up our supper.”\nI was perturbed by the arrangement of my books. I had classified them by using the Hebrew alphabet. After four years abroad, the method appeared alien. Reflectively, I leafed through a Hebrew translation of The Pickwick Papers. Before long I pushed the book aside and read pages of the original. I then turned to Light in August. Some six years earlier on, I had struggled with it. Presently, the text was clear and the style appeared smooth and flowing. To my relief, I had no difficulty with a novel by Remarque, my favourite German author.\nWe had supper in the compact dining room. As anticipated, mother had prepared a goose liver followed by cabbage rolls. I enjoyed every morsel, although during my Oxford days I got used to steak and kidney pie and, over in Singapore, learned to cope with Chinese cuisine.\nMother started the old questioning process while I was digging into the goose liver. She began by asking about my defence of my doctoral thesis. She then kept asking about my life in Singapore. To mother, who had never been in the Far East, a street with crowded food hawkers’ stalls appeared alien. So did my description of Chinese and Indian cultural traits and culinary attainments.\nShe came to her main point when I enjoyed the spicy cabbage rolls. I had written to tell her that I had met a nice girl in Singapore. Mother realised Pat was not of our race or religion. This did not perturb her. She had rung my father, who was then living in Vienna, and he convinced her that neither of them should interfere in such a delicate matter. In truth, I had discussed my plans with him before I wrote to her. All the same, I felt the urge to talk to my mother. I wanted to get her blessing.\n“Do you intend to marry her?”\n“It looks that way,” I conceded.\n“Then you won’t be my problem any longer!” Seeing I was not going to reply, she added: “Do you love the girl?”\n“I believe I do.”\n“If you marry her, you would find it hard to come back to Israel, Peter’le. Have you thought about this?”\n“I have, Mamma. By and large, life in Singapore is easier than over here.”\n“You don’t intend to change your faith, Peter’le?”\n“Of course not. Singapore is tolerant. Nobody will interfere with my faith.”\n“Not even your wife?”\n“Pat and I have a clear understanding in this regard. And look, Mamma, there is very little to attract me back to Tel Aviv. Father has re-settled in Vienna and, sooner or later, you’ll join him. You know I never fitted in here. The ambience of our home, and my general outlook, made me an odd man out.”\n“Is there nothing to draw you back to Israel?”\n“I am afraid not, Mama.”\nMother’s last question turned my mind back to my years as an advocate in Tel Aviv. I had spent them as an employee of Jacob Keren \u0026amp; Associates, a well known law firm in Tel Aviv. One of my colleagues was Rachel Zeitlin. She used to practise law in Jerusalem but, after the breakdown of her second marriage, took up the position of a Senior Associate in our firm. Initially, I appeared as Rachel’s junior in a number of cases assigned to her by our aging employer. In due course, we became a team.\nRachel, who was some six years older than me, was a brilliant courtroom advocate. Her timing was perfect and her manner firm and dogged. Further, she was an outstanding cross-examiner. Frequently, she exposed dishonest witnesses.\nMy role was mainly to fortify our legal points. Rachel, whose understanding of theory left much to be desired, relied on my analytical ability. In a sense, my task was to guard her flanks.\nBefore long, we became close friends. Then, one evening, she invited me over to her place. She knew I admired her and that I had fallen deeply in love with her. When we became intimate, she was still recovering from the breakdown of her second marriage. She got over her setback only after she invited me to live with her.\n“Do you think of Rachel frequently, Peter’le?”\n“I do, Mamma. I’ve tried hard to put her out of my mind; but I can’t.”\n“Do you know Rachel and I have become friends?”\nI had been aware of their friendship. Mother had met Rachel in a bridge club. Rachel had invited her for dinner and in due course they started to meet regularly. Was this an indication that Rachel, too, had not forgotten? During my years abroad, I wrote to her sporadically. Whenever I did, she replied punctually. She had told me of her friendship with my mother, asking: “How on earth could a lively woman like her have a morose son like you?”\n“Rachel asks you to call on her as soon as possible. She wants you to handle a case for one of their clients: an insurance company called Rotem.”\n“What sort of case, Mamma?”\n“It concerns a claim by a fellow called Fischer. He fell off a scaffolding erected in a building he had designed as an architect.”\n“What took him there?”\n“He was also appointed as surveyor. Rachel tells me you know him. He appeared as expert witness in a few of your cases.”\n“Oh yes: I remember him. I would rank his integrity at minus zero. Still, he is glib and proficient. Actually, Mamma, this type of case is very much Rachel’s domain. Why does she want to pass it to another lawyer?”\n“Nowadays she scarcely appears in court. She has taken over the Banking Department. She drafts documents, handles corporate finance and has become an expert in home loans and mortgages.”\n“So why haven’t they assigned to another lawyer of the firm?”\n“I am sure she has reasons.”\n“But should I really take on a case when I am here for just a few weeks? And how did she know I about my visit. I did not contact her.”\n“I told her you were coming over for a few weeks. And, Peter’le, whether to accept or decline the brief is up to you.”\n“Well, I’ll decide after I’ve seen her.”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/scaffolding/part-1/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLydda’s airport – recently renamed the International Airport of Tel Aviv – had been reconstructed during my two years of study at Oxford and my two first years in Singapore.

In dispassionate language, it related how a truck, that had been loaded with logs in one of Solbon’s depots near Haifa, arrived shortly before the Shabbath at its destination in Tel Aviv. It should have been there some two hours earlier but heavy traffic resulted in a protracted delay.\nKeen to call it a day, the ground crew started unloading without taking the ‘ordinary precautions’. Unfortunately, the logs had not been properly secured when loaded. As soon as the rope, holding them together, was loosened, they came crushing down. Most members of the ground crew managed to scramble to safety. Simha Balani, a man of some 52 years of age, was the only one to be caught in the avalanche. When his mates cleared the wreckage above him, he confirmed he was not in pain; but he was unable to rise or to move his legs. The emergency staff of a nearby hospital diagnosed a broken back and a severed spinal cord.\nSix week after the accident, a paraplegic Simha Balani left the hospital in a wheelchair. His active work at the depôt – the pride and joy of his life – had come to a premature end. At this point, the reporter raised an obvious question. What sort of safety measure were used by Solbon – a corporation owned by Israel’s Labour party – in order to safeguard against such accidents?\nMy personal reaction was in accord. Still, my legal training – bolstered by four years in the Law Firm of Jacob Keren and Associates – added a rider. Had there been a lack of supervisory measures or had this been yet another breach of safeguards prescribed in Solbon’s detailed and safety orientated manual?\nSolbon and their insurers, Rotem, were established clients of our firm. I knew they would not deny liability. In all probability, the matter would be handled discreetly between Rotem’s in-house counsel, Ruth Schwartz and Hannah Hod, and the lawyers appointed by Simha. All the same, I kept wondering whether the fault lay in the procedure prescribed by Solbon or in the employees’ carelessness. I could condone the latter but would take a serious view of the former. However, at this stage the matter was not my concern.\nDuring the next days, my time was taken up with two major commercial transactions. Simha Balani’s case soon slipped my mind. Three weeks later, though, the case assumed a different dimension. As soon as I arrived in the office, Jacob Keren’s secretary asked me to report to him. Handing me a freshly opened file, he asked in his direct manner: “Have you heard about this accident?”\n“I read something in the papers,” I told him when I realised that it was Simha Balani’s claim. “Whom do we represent, Mr. Keren?”\n“Rotem. They are prepared to settle; and Solbon is keen. But what do you think of the amount demanded?”\n“Can I have a look at the file?”\n“See me after lunch then!”\nThe documents threw new light on the matter. Simha Balani had been offered an indexed pension equal to 85per cent of his last salary plus a posting as a cashier till his retirement at the ripe age of 65. His lawyers, though, insisted on payment of a lump sum covering his loss of earnings plus damages for loss of enjoyment of life. The former count was calculated conservatively. The latter made me gasp. It exceeded the highest amount ever awarded for such loss by a court in Tel Aviv.\nAll attempts to negotiate had been politely but unequivocally rejected. Simha’s lawyer, my close friend, Boaz Tamir, stood his ground despite Rotem’s attempts to settle. I was aware that Boaz was an able tactician and a realistic lawyer. Although in our present roles as employees we regularly found ourselves on opposing sides of a case, we were discreetly making plans to establish our own legal firm. Boaz was to be the managing partner. Knowing Boaz’s calibre, I took his demands – ‘prayers’ – seriously as I studied the Balani file. There could, of course, be no doubt about Simha’s loss and sufferings. An industrial accident had turned a healthy even if aging man into a wreck. He would never walk again and other comforts, too, were lost to him. Still, a browse through the file revealed two weaknesses. One was that on numerous occasions Simha had refused to give up his out-of-doors job and accept an equally well-paid office post. The other was more complex. When the logs started to roll down, Simha had been out of range. He had stepped forward to drag a fellow worker to safety. Why should an old hand like him risk life and limb to warn off a younger and fitter man? Simha was not the foreman and had not been put in charge!\nJacob Keren listened keenly to my analysis. It was clear that, in most regards, I affirmed the points he had spotted on his own. As I closed the file, he fell into a reverie. When, at long last, he broke the silence, he came straight to the point.\n“What do you recommend?”\n“We can’t deny liability. To do so would be counter productive and, in any event, Rotem and Solbon would get a rotten Press. The best course is to admit liability and persuade Simha to accept the indexed pension plus the posting. In the long run, these are better then a lump sum. If he refuses, we’d have to contest the amount. And we might have to plead contributory negligence: we would have no choice.”\n“On what ground would you base a count of ‘contributory negligence’?”\n“Why on earth did he rush in? And, Mr. Keren: didn’t he assume an extra risk by holding on to a young man’s job at the ripe age of 52?” “I get the thrust! So, how about handling the case for us, young Eli!”\n“On my own?”\n“High time. And it’s a ‘win-win’ situation. We are prepared to pay Simha what is due to him; but not more than that. Or do you want Ravid or Kadmon to lead you?” Experience had taught me that these two took the laurels but refused to share the work: “How about Rachel Zeitlin?” I wanted to know.\n“Is it her sort of case?” asked Keren severely. He was, of course, right. Rachel Zeitlin was a brilliant courtroom advocate: dogged, quick on the uptake, focused and sensitive to atmosphere. She knew when to drop a weak point and when to come up with her punch line. True, her ability to analyse complex legal points left much to be desired. Here, however, I excelled. Between the two of us we had won a string of difficult cases and, in the process, acquired the reputation of a formidable team. The instant case, though, required low key handling. A searching cross-examination and belligerent tactics were out of place.\n“She might not pull her punches,” I conceded.\n“And we don’t want to rub Simha’s nose in it. An honourable defeat is what we want!” After a brief reflection, he summed up. “Tell you what: you take charge of the file. But why don’t you discuss it with her? The two of you work well together.”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/simha-glory/part-1/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAn interesting  fact of life, reinforced by the Balani case, is that, occasionally, some apparently unrelated episodes may nevertheless be intertwined: the outcome of one may have a bearing on the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first information was a reportage in an Israeli newspaper.

She caught up with me at the foot of the staircase. Grinning, she conceded: “So you won the race, my pet. You must have got up right after you crawled into your bed.”\n“I don’t need much sleep. And you waited by your ‘phone for my call. I really don’t know why you fret like this.”\n“You left my flat at 2.00 a.m. and were too proud to call a taxi! You had to take the half hour walk home!”\n“So why not marry me and solve the problem,” I coaxed.\n“Now, now, Eli – how about our agreement?”\n“Eh?” I let my surprise show.\n“You undertook, solemnly and formally, to propose just once a month; and you proposed just two days ago.”\n“This is not a joking matter, Miss Rachel Zeitlin!” I let my chagrin show.\n“Quite, quite. So, let’s change the subject!”\nWe had by now reached the third floor of the ramshackle building, which housed Jacob Keren and Associates, one of the best law firms in Tel-Aviv. As we walked through the waiting room, my glance fell on an attractive Sephardic girl, sitting beside her mother on the bench in front of our employer’s room. She was young, with dark skin, brilliant black eyes and elegantly styled lush hair. Neatly dressed and groomed, she looked out of place in the dark, spacey yet crammed outer room. Unwittingly, I bestowed on her an admiring glance, which she pretended not to note.\n“Love at first sight, my pet?” asked Rachel, sweetly, as we turned into corridor leading to our offices.\n“Don’t be silly: I’m in love with just one woman!”\n“Not readily discernible from that admiring glance!”\n“Purely aesthetic, Rachel, purely aesthetic.”\n“Lucky, then, that you didn’t see her hands!”\n“She kept them under the table,” I conceded, puzzled.\n“With good reason, Eli. She is Dahlia Nissim!”\nI was about to say ‘Eh’, when the penny dropped. Rachel’s nod put the matter beyond doubt. The mysterious girl in our waiting room was, indeed, in need of legal representation. Her rosy future had been put in jeopardy by a gruesome accident.\nDahlia Nissim’s tragedy took place during the long vacation following her penultimate year in High School. Having a penchant for smartly bound books, she secured temporary employment in a firm of master printers called Wollor. One of her tasks was to clean and polish the electric paper guillotine, used for trimming the edges of bound volumes. In the process, the protective guard, placed in front of the blade, had to be removed. Naturally, the switch was off and, of course, the blade was not expected to operate. But, on that fateful day, the blade unexpectedly came down and amputated Dahlia’s hands. The shock would have killed an older person. Dahlia, though, was young, strong and resilient. After a spell in hospital, she came out recovered in spirit. Her hands, alas, were gone.\nThe owner of Wollor, an aging Second World War migrant from Leipzig, was heart broken. His firm was renowned for its excellent relations with staff. And its record for safety measures and accident prevention was impeccable. Far from seeking to shirk responsibility, Herr Franz Wolf ensured that Dahlia got the best medical care available and visited her regularly during her spell in the hospital. He was keen to make reparation but, to his dismay, discovered that Wollor’s accident and third-party liability policy had lapsed.\nWollor did not have the funds needed to pay the damages. The only hope was to induce the insurance company to admit liability. As Wollor had been a customer for many years, Franz Wolf hoped the insurers would be open to argument. He was dismayed to discover that this was a difficult task. After all, why should an insurance company, which had not received its premium, agree to fork out the stupendous amount involved?\nThe Press did not disclose the name of the insurers. I was surprised when Rachel told me they were Rotem, an Israeli company effectively owned the labour party. Our firm was on Rotem’s panel, and, in addition, Jacob Keren was one of its non-executive directors. In consequence, we normally turned down briefs against them.\n“Dahlia’s late father was a comrade in arms of Keren’s days in the labour movement,” explained Rachel. “I suspect he had also been a tout. Dahlia’s mother turned to us when the chips were down. And Jacob Keren is not one to forget an old friend.”\n“But did we get dispensation from Rotem?”\n“Of course we did. They were happy to see the matter in the hands of a responsible adversary – with whom they could talk. You know they hate uncivilised courtroom skirmishes. And in this type of case, an aggressive opponent would resort to such tactics. Keren intends to pass the file on to us. He says he thinks we’ll do an excellent job!”\n“How pious,” I muttered. “Who acts for the other parties?”\nIt turned out that Israel Silver’s firm acted for Wollor. Both Silver and Franz Wolf were on the Board of the Tel Aviv Ceramics Society and knew each other well. As Silver’s firm was also on Rotem’s panel, they too had to secure dispensation. To avoid acting against a major client in person, Israel Silver delegated the file to Boaz Tamir, a pal from my University days. Regrettably, Rotem’s choice of counsel was less encouraging. They had engaged Ben Zion Vered.\n“Shit,” I said.\n“You mean ‘shut’, my pet. But why this gloomy look? Ben Zion is a good lawyer. And a smart opponent keeps you on your toes. He’s better than a dud whom you don’t take seriously.”\nAs a general statement, Rachel’s sentiment was supportable. In the instant case, though, she overlooked two factors. The first related to Ben Zion’s outlook: he was a stickler to the rules. Moved by Dahlia’s tragedy, some other lawyer might encourage Rotem to make an ex-gratia payment. Ben Zion was unlikely to succumb to such sentimentality. In his eyes, a strict application of doctrine would be preferable to a settlement based on sympathy. An insurance company was not a charitable organisation. So why should it pay money if it was not legally bound to do so?\nBen Zion’s circumstances were bound to encourage him to stick to this line. Having resigned from a leading law firm after a shouting match, Ben Zion had launched his own law firm. Competition remained fierce and, even after two years, Ben Zion was still on the make. To get established, he had to win cases referred to him. Voluntary settlements of unsustainable claims brought against his clients were to be avoided at all costs.\nMy second apprehension related to a motion reading “this House opines that the Law is an Ass” debated at the Philosophical Society of Israel. Ben Zion moved; Boaz and myself, who were then still in our student days, opposed.\nI recalled with a grin how Ben Zion, who had already been called to the Bar, rose to his feet and delivered a measured and well-structured speech. His sober suit, tall figure, broad shoulders, ruddy face and beaked nose conferred on him an aura of respectability, underscored by the blue-and-white scalp-cap pinned to his thinning hair. Speaking slowly and deliberately, he demonstrated that our legal system was full of contradictions, inconsistencies and plain absurdities. It was plain stupid or – in other words – an ass!\nThere could be no doubt about the soundness of the address. Unfortunately, Ben Zion was not endowed with a sense of humour and, to exacerbate matters, repeated himself incessantly. When at long last he resumed his seat, applause was restrained.\nSpeaking in refutation, Boaz, who delivered our address, pointed out that the motion comprised two determinative words: “Law” and “Ass”. Boaz conceded that the Law was stupid, adding that this was to be expected: the “law” was nothing but a blunt tool used to prevent people from doing what they desired. For instance, once a speaker (and here Boaz mimicked Ben Zion) had repeated himself thrice, every intelligent listener wished to punch him. But in law such a rational act constituted assault. Was this not absurd?\nWaiting for the laughter to subside, Boaz turned to the “ass”. Boaz insisted that, far from being stupid, the noble “donkey” deserved admiration. Passages in the Bible (such as the episode of Balaam) and in later sources supported our contention. So did observations taken from everyday life. For instance, you could ride a horse to its death or keep loading a camel until the last straw broke its back. The donkey, in contrast, jettisoned a rider who drove him too hard and shook off a load once it became too heavy! Accordingly, was the humble donkey not smarter than the silly horse and the dumb camel?\nTo conclude our address, Boaz turned back to the motion before the House. While we accepted that the law was stupid, we were convinced the humble ass was a wise and intelligent being. Ergo the Law was not an ass: it was too stupid to deserve such an honourable title!\nThe recollection of that episode brought a blush to my face. Rachel, who had been observing me keenly, was quick to catch on. “You are not thinking of that old debacle, when Boaz and you lampooned poor Ben Zion?”\n“I am rather. Wouldn’t he love to pay us back?”\n“I don’t think so, my pet. I know he was furious. I watched him whilst the two of you carried on that childish prank …”\n“I didn’t know you were there. It happened long before we met!”\n“True: but I, too, am a member of the Philosophical Society.”\n“I hope you weren’t bored.”\n“Disappointed rather; but I was amused. Still, you needn’t worry about this old business. Ben Zion won’t let it affect his ‘judgment’. But he’ll be on his guard when he deals with you two; and we’ll have to persuade him and Rotem that payment is ‘appropriate’. They won’t buy the ‘poor helpless victim’ argument. We need something better.”\nShe was right. At this stage, I could not find a sound legal argument to pressure Rotem. I was about to express my doubts, when Jacob Keren’s secretary summoned us to his office. The clients, she said, were keen to meet us.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ravages-of-a-guillotine/part-1/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThat morning I arrived at work just before Rachel.

Ltd was dumped unceremoniously on my desk late in the morning, on a heavily clouded day in early spring, by Jacob Keren, sole proprietor of J. Keren \u0026amp; Associates, Advocates, of Rothschild Boulevard, Tel Aviv. A short choleric man in his late fifties, with thick glasses, receding hair and a loud metallic voice, he was – as was his wont – in a foul mood.\n“I can’t understand why this idiotic matter has been sent to us. Ruth Schwartz ought to handle such a simple case from her smart desk at Rotem. Find out why she passed it on to us, will you, Eli?”\n“When do you need the answer, Mr Keren?”\n“Yesterday!!!” he muttered.\n“I’ll attend to it over lunch,” I heard my mute reply.\n“Very good! And – before I forget – think who would be good person to handle the case! And that file of Kadmon you are working on can wait: he sat on it for three months!”\n“Very well, Mr Keren!”\n“And, Eli, did I see you yesterday in ‘Habimah’?”\n“I was there. I love Peer Gynt! Where were you seated?”\n“Circle, 3rd Row! What did you think of the performance?”\n“Excellent. But I wish Finkel had curbed his Russian accent!”\n“You can’t expect everybody to speak Hebrew like a Yekke!” He retorted, departing before I had a chance to recover.\nIt was fortunate that the last exchange took place in 1958. Three years earlier on, when I had joined Keren’s firm during my last year in Law School, his pungent retort would have crushed me. My long spell in his firm, taught me to take Jacob Keren’s acid tongue with a pinch of salt. To start with, it had dawned on me that, like most Russian Jews, Keren respected the mid-European German speaking Jewry. His jibes at the Yekkes camouflaged cultural envy. I had also worked out that Keren’s assessment of his staff was based on their performance. If you were good at your job, you could safely ignore his outbursts, tantrums and patent rudeness.\nJacob Keren’s mannerism did not endear him to his employees. Many banged the door never to return. On a few occasions, I, too, came close to quitting. Invariably, though, I decided to stick it out. Jacob Keren was a brilliant courtroom tactician, had a singularly sharp and methodical legal mind and was an excellent teacher. During my years in his firm, I grew from a starry-eyed law graduate into a realistic and down to earth lawyer.\nPlacing Kadmon’s file in my ‘hold’ tray, I got stuck into the papers referred to me. Running quickly through them, I concluded that Keren’s outburst was well founded. The facts of the case were plain. Omri Tal, a young dental technician, had been riding home on his bicycle after a pleasant evening in a dancing club in Ramat-Gan. He was proceeding along a poorly lit and narrow stretch of road on his way back to Tel-Aviv, when a truck bumped into him. Fortunately, he escaped without head or back injuries. But his right leg was a mess. His shin and thigh bones sustained multiple fractures and his knee cap was smashed. Omri spent eight days in hospital followed by six weeks at home, with his leg in a cast. The bones healed. But the report of his orthopaedic surgeon affirmed that a certain weakness would remain for life and that his knee would be stiff for years to come. A second orthopaedic surgeon, engaged by our clients – the Rotem Insurance Company – confirmed that Omri’s injury was of a ‘permanent or semi-permanent’ nature.\nOmri Tal conceded that the accident was caused in part by his own ‘stupidity’. The charger, connected to the headlight of his bike, had been out of order for a few days and he had not “had the time to get it fixed or to buy a torch”. His dark clothes exacerbated the visibility problem. The driver, who had knocked Omri off his bike, was also at fault. Solomon Vered had been on the road since 6.00 a.m. On his own admission, he had been ‘dead tired’ when he picked up his last load for the day in Netanya. The delivery, though, was marked ‘urgent’. The designated relief driver was ill in bed and Solomon Vered, whose son was in his third year in the School of Engineering, coveted the generous overtime pay. He conceded that, had he not been ‘so exhausted’, he might have spotted Omri although the bike was without lights.\nThe basic legal position was clear: the loss was to be apportioned based on the parties’ fault, which meant that each of them had to bear a part reflecting his contribution to the occurrence of the accident. In the instant case, any lawyer practising in the field would have predicted a division of approximately fifty-fifty, with a possible variation of up to 10% either way depending on the facts emerging in the cross-examination. It followed that Rotem had to reckon with the payment of damages equalling about one half of the loss sustained by Omri.\nThe difficulty in the case was in quantifying that loss. Naturally, there was no argument about the amount due to Omri for the money he lost during the eight weeks he was unable to work. His annual income was about IL4,000. Accordingly, this loss amounted to about IL615.00. Rotem had agreed to pay half of that amount and was prepared to cover Omri’s medical expenses. In addition, the firm was prepared to pay an appropriate sum by way of damages to compensate him for the pain and sufferings he had sustained during the period involved.\nThe contentious element concerned two further claims made by Omri’s lawyers. One was for loss of future earnings resulting from the permanent injury to his right leg. In a letter addressed to Rotem, Omri’s lawyer, Boaz Tamir, said that dental technicians did most of their work on their feet, standing by their bench or “moving about in their sophisticated workshops, equipped with kilns, moulds and other instruments placed on different work stations”. Omri’s accident was bound to slow him down considerably, reducing his foreseeable future earnings by at least 50%. Taking into account all factors, including the benefit derived by the payment of a lump sum ahead of the anticipated earnings, the damages so suffered were assessed at IL18,000.00. Ruth Schwartz, Rotem’s in-house legal adviser, expressed her strong disagreement in her reply. Jacob Keren was less adamant. “Ask for further particulars,” was scribbled in the margin of our copy of Boaz Tamir’s letter.\nOmri’s other controversial claim had nothing to do with his profession. For the three years preceding the accident, he and his charming girl friend had held the Israeli Dancing Club’s trophy for the Rumba and were also voted the runners up in the Polish Folk Dances competition. Boaz Tamir dealt with this aspect of the claim in a few pungent sentences: “It is a shame that our client’s injuries – which will prevent him from taking part in further dancing competitions – have deprived the Israeli World of Art of the stimulating input of a most able and promising participant. It saddens us to have to say that our client will never regain his skills as a virtuoso dancer. The quality of his life will, thus, not be the same as prior to the accident!”\nThe amount of IL30,000.00 demanded for the ‘ensuing loss of enjoyment of life and consequential mental pain’ made me gasp. Ruth Schwartz’s reaction had been equally strong. In her reply, she described the claim as unreasonable and wildly excessive. On this point, Jacob Keren voiced his consent, scribbling: “Why not suggest the young man take up a less strenuous hobby like playing the piano or crossword puzzles?”\nUsually, cases of this sort ended with an amicable settlement. But Boaz Tamir was a tough, tenacious and shrewd courtroom virtuoso. I had argued cases against him in mock trials during our days in Law School. Although I had bested him on fine questions of law, he had a knack of springing surprises on points of fact. Frequently, he pulled the rug from under the feet of myself and other adversaries by presenting fresh evidence or by twisting the tail of one of our witnesses. He had put his gladiatorial skills to good use after being called to the Bar.\nRuth knew she was no match for Boaz. When he rejected her overture for a settlement, she decided to play safe. She passed the file on to her old pupil-master and first employer, Jacob Keren. His jaundiced remarks about the referral were triggered by his natural resentment of employees who left his firm to join the staff of one of his major clients. Although for all outward appearances he remained on good term with Ruth, he continued to smoulder about her desertion.\nI spent the next two hours on a further perusal of the documents. I soon noted that Boaz had cooked his figures. A meticulous search in our library established, further, that the claim for Omri’s loss of future enjoyment on life was flawed. In his enthusiastic quest for justice, Boaz had conveniently forgotten that the law imposed on the injured party a duty to mitigate his loss. This meant that if Omri was no longer able to pursue his original vocation or hobby he had to look for suitable alternatives. Encapsulating my conclusions in a short, hand written note, I added: “I suggest we call the plaintiff’s bluff: in my opinion, Hannah Hod is the best person to take charge.” Satisfied with my decision, I delivered the file to Jacob Keren’s secretary. Then, just as the clock chimed 2.00 p.m., I rushed out to grab a sandwich for lunch.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/the-luck-of-valentino/part-1/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe correspondence respecting the case of Omri Tal  versus Solomon Vered and Movil \u0026amp; Co.

The Platform Phenomenon An event that took place in an underground-train station in Munich’s inner city had far reaching effects on the life of three persons: Peppi Stölzl – who rose thereafter in the world, became Sir Joseph-Dieter, Freiherr von Stölzenfeld – my late father, Robert Berger, known to friends as ‘Tommy’, and myself, Peter Berger, a mendicant professor who eventually settled in Singapore but travelled from time to time to London where eventually I met Peppi,\nThe station, which had been upgraded after Germany’s capitulation at the end of World War II was lauded on both sides of the Atlantic (except by the envious French). There was, however, one snag. The station served as an interchange for commuters travelling to the west and to the airport. In consequence, the platform was overcrowded during rush hours: disembarking passengers often collided with commuters attempting to board. The records of the First Aid Room, listing black eyes, broken collar bones, crushed noses and ‘abdominal injuries’, bore witness to the strong German tendency to fight for right.\nSomething had to be done. Eventually, a Committee came up with a plan. An elevated podium was erected in the centre of the platform. As rush hour began, the Station Master – wearing a Bavarian helmet and the sparkling uniform of Frederick the Great’s Guards – climbed up to the podium. When the doors of an incoming train opened, he shouted “Raus” (meaning “get out”), whereupon the alighting passengers leapt onto the platform. He then yelled “Rein” (“get in”), signifying that embarking passengers ought to board.\nThe system suffered an initial hitch. Due to background noise, the passengers could not hear the Station Master’s commands. Occasionally some of them climbed in when the Station Master had actually yelled “Raus”. The ensuing skirmishes were on the fierce side because each party felt he was in the right.\nThe Committee, thereupon, refined the procedure by adding ‘visual stimuli’ (meaning, in plain English, ‘hand signals’) to the oral commands. This upgraded system proved a great success. The passengers seeking to disembark obeyed the beckoning hand whilst those congregating on the platform waited patiently for the verbal command. After some three months the City Council granted the Station Master a substantial pay rise and awarded him a medal. By then the venture had become something of a phenomenon: travellers from all over Germany, as well as tourists from places as remote as Kathmandu and the Tierra del Fuego, flocked to Munich to witness the proceedings.\n2. Reunion of Old Friends My late father, Tommy, was an ardent student of modern enterprise. When business took him to Munich, he arrived one bright morning at the platform just in time to watch the Station Master mounting his podium with a dignified air. Then, as the Station Master turned around, Dad gave a slight start. The grand man on the stage was none other than Peppi – his old classmate and bosom pal of his youth in Vienna. For a moment Dad stood still; then their eyes met, and, despite the approaching train, Peppi managed to signal that they should meet as soon as the session was over.\n“So you’re back, Tommy,” Peppi grinned, as he joined Dad after autographing a number of notebooks and cards proffered by members of the public.\n“I am. And you, Peppi, really look splendid in your uniform.”\n“Here, just let me get out of this outfit,” said Peppi when they arrived in his office. “Thirteen years have passed since we last saw one another. It’s good to see you again and to know that you, too, came through.”\nThey embraced – the way Viennese men often did in the old days – and for a few minutes simply sat together in silence in the compact room. For some reason, neither of them could find the right words to express his feelings, although each knew what his friend wanted to say.\n“Tommy,” Peppi broke the silence, “shall we go to the Kneipe [pub] around the corner? We have a lot to talk about. I kept hoping you found a safe place – where there was no madness.”\n“I sensed you’d be alright, Peppi,” said Dad as they stepped out of the station. “You fought a whole year in the trenches in 1917 but came out unscathed. Few did. I had a few close shaves in my one month as a trainee officer on the Western Front in 1918. But you were bullet-proof. You’ve been lucky all your life! The only time I feared for you was when the Russians overran Vienna in 1944.”\n“I was in Munich by then. I got out of Vienna as soon as Hitler declared War on the Soviet Union.”\n3. From the Trenches Back to the Prater The Kneipe was empty though not desolate. The pinewood furniture, the colourful posters on the walls and the array of bottles along the bar gave the premises an intimate atmosphere. A sleepy waitress came over to take their orders. Her welcoming smile showed that Peppi was a regular. Dad asked for a coffee.\nDad watched with mild disapproval as Peppi stirred a nip of clear liquid into his draught beer. He used to worry about Peppi’s drinking habit in the old days and, despite the years of separation, once again felt the urge to protect him.\n“Kirsch or Vodka?” he asked.\n“Slivovitz,” replied Peppi, unperturbed. “Just as I had it in the Prater. Slivovitz is good for you; in moderation, of course. So is your drink, Tommy: coffee with rum kept us going in the trenches, through all that snow! In WWI, I was the orderly of my troop. I used to sneak out to get my mates Slivovitz, Kirsch or any Schnapps I could lay my hands on. We needed it even more than food: just to help us get through the stench, the freezing cold and the death all around us.”\n“And to think that after that senseless butchery they had to start it all over again.”\n“People never learn; especially not the politicians. But enough of that, Tommy. Come on – have another coffee, but this time with rum.”\nBoth felt more at ease after the second round. Over the third they began to reminisce. Soon they were sniggering about the pranks they had played in their school days in Otakring, the then working-class district of Vienna. After a while they even reverted to the old Otakring slang – Viennese Cockney.\nThey laughed when Dad recalled the lesson they had taught the theology teacher. The fellow used his ruler in lieu of a rod whenever any pupil asked an unorthodox, let alone a provocative, question. He was all the more hated because he assigned them boring homework and, in addition, forced them to learn long and boring religious texts by heart.\nHaving suffered the man’s tantrums patiently for months, Dad and Peppi decided to curb his enthusiasm. One day, the teacher explained that God wanted all men to worship Him. Dad thereupon wanted to know why He did not reveal himself regularly. Would this not be simpler and more productive – Dad asked with an ingratiating smile – than to expect weak humanity to discover the way on its own? Dad confessed that the answer eluded him but trusted that the ‘Herr Professor’ would shed light on the problem.\nCharmed by Dad’s sweet manner and savouring the respectful form of his address, the theology teacher tried hard to grapple with the question that had baffled philosophers through the ages. Beads of sweat soon formed on his brow. While this debacle was in progress, Peppi crept between the benches and tied the teacher’s shoelaces together. He then retreated to his seat and signalled ‘mission accomplished’; whereupon Dad asked in a suddenly aggressive voice:\n“But if God is perfect, why can’t he instil in us the wish to follow his commands out of love? Or isn’t He all that perfect after all?”\n“That’s blasphemy!” yelled the teacher, leaping to his feet, rod-ruler in hand – only to land on his nose.\n4. Escapes during the Nazi era. Peppi’s survival and union with Helga. “They were wonderful days,” Peppi sighed. “But tell me, Tommy, how is Dora? She, too, came through, didn’t she? And how is your Peter’le? He must be about 17.”\nPeppi listened attentively to the story of my family’s escape from Europe just before the beginning of WWII. “It’s too bad that your Peter’le has asthma; but then, Tommy, you always had a weak chest. Still, the main thing is the three of you are together!”\n“Yes,” nodded Dad. Then, unable to contain himself any longer, he added, “and we have to thank you, Josef. You risked your life in 1938, when you smuggled that briefcase with the ‘black’ money across to me just before the boarding call. And you took another risk when you sneaked Dora’s jewellery through the airport customs.”\n“You would have done the same for me, Tommy.”\n“I certainly hope so. But you can’t tell until you face the music. I might have been too scared.”\n“I was frightened,” said Peppi thoughtfully. “But I knew I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if I let you down. I wasn’t so determined when it came to others.”\nFor a few moments both kept their counsel. Dad recalled the day Peppi’s father, a seasoned tram driver, was run over by a tram which was being driven out of the depot by one of his own comrades. An autopsy revealed that Heinrich Stölzl had been inebriated at the time of the accident. Vienna City Council’s reaction was stern. Peppi’s mother was denied a pension. Tram drivers had been cautioned about the dire consequences of drinking at work and the city’s elders hoped their severity would serve as a warning to other offenders.\nPeppi Stölzl had to leave his professional training school, the Fachschule, and look for work. Turning down the City Council’s offer of a job on the trams, his first job was as an usher in the hell train at the Prater (Vienna’s Loonapark). A ‘friendly giant’ like him was just right for the job! He then worked as a waiter in a Heuriger [wine garden] in Grinzing. Later on he got a job in a business firm.\nProving himself to be a diligent worker, Peppi was soon made the supervisor and, after a few years, was left in charge of the thriving business. By the time of the Anschluß [Austria’s annexation by Nazi Germany] he had been made junior partner, with the ageing boss hinting that, in due course, the firm’s name would be changed to ‘Rosenberg \u0026amp; Stölzl’. Effectively, Peppi had risen from the ranks of the working-class to the Mittelstand [the bourgeoisie].\n“What happened to Roenberg?” asked Dad.\n“He was taken in custody. Nobody saw him again. The new ‘Aryan’ owner of the shop asked me to stay on as second-in-command to his brother-in-law. I refused, of course.”\n“What did you do?”\nTo start with, Peppi sought and, once again, obtained employment at the Prater. He was in fact too old for this type of job, but most young men had been conscripted. Quite apart from this, his army bearing and tall figure stood him in good stead.\nA few months later, he accepted the post of chief waiter in a popular restaurant. Before long, he became the go-between for the owners of local restaurants and provincial farmers anxious to sell their meagre supplies at the best black market prices obtainable. In this way, Peppi had become wealthy.\nThen, unexpectedly, Hitler declared war on the Soviet Union and opened the Eastern front. In less than two weeks, Peppi packed his suitcases, sold his belongings, converted his cash into gold coins and moved to Salzburg.\n“The German pundits hoped for victory,” he told Dad. “I knew they deluded themselves. Napoleon had his own version of Blitzkrieg; and look how he lost his army in Moscow. No, Tommy, I never forgot what happened to my own troop in the winter of 1917. The very idea that one single nation could fight and win on two major fronts without enough petrol or adequate supply lines was madness!”\n“But what was the point in your running off to Salzburg?”\n“I knew the Nazis would have to conscript middle aged men like me and that they would start in Vienna. So, I escaped before it was too late.”\nUpon arriving in Salzburg, Peppi was assisted by an old flame from his Prater days, who had opened a hairdressing salon near the Mozarteum. To start with, she dyed his hair grey. She then trained him to walk like an aged man. When Peppi had grown accustomed to his new guise, she secured him the post of usher in a nightclub and found him a room in a pension run by a discreet landlord.\nPeppi had intended to spend the rest of the War in Salzburg. Fortuna had other plans for him. Early in 1943, a soldier who returned to Salzburg after being wounded in North Africa, discovered that his wife was carrying on with Peppi. As he had nothing better to do, he spied on his rival. Soon he realised that Peppi was considerably younger than he strove to appear. Peppi, who perceived the cuckold’s dark glances, became wary. Then, one evening, the man hurled the accusation of ‘draft dodger’ at him. Early next morning, Peppi got a call from the hairdresser, urging him to clear out before it was too late.\nPeppi Stölzl did not wait. Once again he packed his things and rushed to the railway station, stopping only at the bank to empty his safe. Anxiously he boarded the first train, heaving a sigh of relief when he disembarked unnoticed in Munich. To avoid identification, he rinsed the dye out of his hair. A glance in the mirror made him gasp. His once lustrous black shock of hair was ingrained with streaks of salt and pepper. Sombrely, Peppi reflected that, whilst his luck was still holding, time had not stood still.\nThe pace in the large town differed from the congenial tempo of provincial Salzburg. Despite the constraints imposed by WWII, the Burghers of Munich were rushing about busily. Peppi felt galvanised and, in addition, kept his ear to the ground. Within one week of his arrival, he came to know of the reverses in North Africa and the ‘strategic withdrawals’ on the Eastern front. Shortly thereafter, he had his first glimpse of the trains carrying wounded soldiers back from the battlefields. To his own surprise, Peppi Stölzl felt the call of duty. Discarding the brace he had placed over his right knee to simulate a limp; he gave up his well-paid night-receptionist job in a shady establishment and joined the militia as a medical corps volunteer. In due course he was assigned to the surgical ward of the general hospital.\n“I couldn’t do much for them. We had no proper medicines, insufficient beds, and very few doctors. Often, all I could do for a dying soldier was to hold his hand and try to comfort him. Many died of shock after clumsy amputations. It was butchery, Tommy, plain butchery!”\n“Was it worse than the trenches in 1917?”\n“It was indeed. You see, when you got your wounded comrade onto the orderly’s stretcher, or into the first aid tent at the front, you thought he’d get help. If he was conscious, he, too, was still hoping. Here in Munich, after the harassing ride on the train, the wounded were beyond hope. Most of them could do no more than make feeble cries for help.”\n“Help from above?” asked Dad.\n“No, Tommy. They were asking for their Mutter; and some called out the name of a woman – a wife, a fiancée or a girlfriend. Very few, Tommy, very few called God or prayed. Are you surprised?”\nShrugging his shoulders Dad said soberly, “Can’t say I am.”\n“I remember one boy,” Peppi went on, “a lad young enough to be my son. He had been shot through his stomach and was dying right in front of my eyes. He begged me to give him water. When I told him it would kill him instantly, he said: ‘better so; just give it to me. Hell can’t be worse than this!’ And I knew he meant it.”\n“What did you do?” asked Dad.\n“I continued to wipe his brow with a wet cloth and, from time to time, moistened his lips. After a while he dozed off but continued to breathe for an hour or so. He went without opening his eyes again.”\n“Poor boy.”\n“We had many like him. Young men dying without having lived. And for what, Tommy, for what? For Lebensraum; for the blasted Vaterland; or to satisfy the ravings of a uniformed madman?”\n“A shameful mess brought about by greed, stupidity and blindness. And it’s not as if anybody stood to gain from it,” agreed Dad.\n“Nobody except the carpetbaggers. But, you know, for me Munich was a turning point: it was there, in that hospital, that I met Helga.”\nHelga Gießen was a primary school teacher by training. In 1943 she enrolled in a crash course on nursing, completed it with ‘extraordinary distinction’ and promptly enlisted in Munich’s general hospital. Although Peppi was her senior by some twenty years, she soon fell in love with the kind-hearted giant who toiled day and night to comfort the wounded soldiers. Initially, Peppi prevaricated, pretending not to notice his new colleague’s tender glances. Common sense whispered that he was too old for her. And experience told him that it was best to avoid women with serious intentions. A smart man could have fun yet preserve his freedom.\nA girl less determined than Helga would have given up. Her pride would have dictated a dignified retreat. Helga was above such pettiness. Concluding that Peppi was shy, she continued to besiege him. After a while, Peppi responded. Quite naturally, he was flattered by the persistent attentions showered on him by this young and upright girl. In addition, an inner voice murmured that he was into his forties, had never experienced a lasting relationship with a seriously minded woman and was in danger of having to walk the rest of the of his life on his own.\nWhen, at long last, Peppi invited young Helga to the local opera, she was up to the occasion. Far from displaying maidenly reserve, she accepted gladly and suggested that they have supper at her place after the show. Peppi opened his eyes wide, gulped and smiled graciously. After three months they were engaged. Early in 1945, in defiance of the persistent bombing raids and the general gloom that pervaded Germany, they were married. To his own amazement, Peppi suggested that the ceremony be held in Helga’s Protestant church.\n“Helga is a believer, Tommy. And, as you well know, I am a non-practising Roman Catholic. So, I went her way. It was the right thing do, wasn’t it?”\n“As long as you went her way willingly. But the main point, Peppi: you are happy with Helga, aren’t you?”\n“I am indeed. You see, Helga is not a beauty. She doesn’t have a perfect figure and isn’t the best dresser in the world. And she isn’t chic or playful. But she has character and personality and is a strong and dependable woman. I trust her fully; and I know where I stand with her.”\n“So, she is a good wife. Once again, Peppi, you fell on your feet!”\n“I did, Tommy, so I did.”\nPeppi hesitated for a moment and then produced a photograph from his wallet. Dad saw a small woman in her early thirties, wearing a plain skirt and blouse. Her high brow, aquiline nose and sharp features matched her conservative hairstyle and firm mouth. A little girl sat on her lap and smiled into the camera.\n“This is Lucy,” Peppi’s face relaxed into a smile. “We thought it best not to have children until the end of the War. Next year Lucy will start school.”\n“Is she your only one?”\n“Our second will arrive in some six or seven weeks. Helga is having a tough time and so it’s bound to be our last one: never mind if it’s a boy or a girl.”\n“I hope everything will be fine,” said Dad.\n“Of course it will! Helga’s a tough girl. She doesn’t feel sorry for herself. But I can see how much it’s taken out of her.”\n“Is she going back to work later on?”\n“She is indeed. But not to the hospital. Helga says that we have to make sure the next generation won’t repeat our mistakes. She wants to go back to her old school. She’ll help to ‘forge the unformed conscience of our race’.”\n“What a pungent line,” said Dad reflectively.\n“Some Irish novelist wrote words to this effect. Helga was very impressed with his book, all about a young author in Dublin. I couldn’t make head or tail of it.”\nObviously, Peppi had not read James Joyce during his youth in Vienna. Neither had Dad! Vienna had been as inward-looking as other European centres of the day and just as blissfully unaware of its insularity.\nFor a while, both Dad and Peppi were lost in their respective thoughts. Peppi’s reflections centred on the old days. Dad meandered through Peppi’s odyssey. He was relieved that, as often before, his friend had brought his ship home. It was as if some invisible hand kept sheltering him, just as it did when others were felled by the enemy’s bullets during the dreadful months in the trenches toward the end of WWI.\n“And when did you become station master?” Dad broke the silence.\nSnapping back into the real world, Peppi signalled to the waitress. After, she had placed another cup of coffee in front of Dad and a beer chaser within Peppi’s reach, he resumed his story.\nWhen WWII was over, Peppi gave up his job in the hospital and opened a traditional Bavarian beer garden. The takings, though, were meagre. Frequently, patrons had just one tankard, sipping at it slowly and appreciatively.\nTo improve his financial position, Peppi opened the “garden” only in the evening and looked for an extra job to occupy him during daytime. Once again he drifted from one post to another. It was by chance that he was engaged by the contractor in charge of the construction work at the underground station. Peppi was too old for this type of work; but his powerful frame and his army bearings impressed the clerk in charge of recruitment. Peppi excelled. After two months, he was made the foreman of his gang. When the renovation was complete, he was appointed station master.\n“So now you know my entire story, Tommy,” said Peppi with a smile.\n“Do you still run the beer garden?”\n“Of course, and it’s picking up!”\n“I see. But don’t you think you should begin to take things easy? You are two years older than me – that makes you 53!”\n“Thanks for reminding me,” grinned Peppi. “But, Tommy, I got married late in life; and I want my kids to have good prospects. I owe it to them. So, I’d better work hard while I still have the strength to do so. I hope that Lucy will go to university. Wouldn’t it be nice to send her to Heidelberg or Göttingen?”\n“But you mustn’t kill yourself in the process, Peppi!”\n“I won’t – as long as I have enough Slivovitz \u0026hellip; Yes, yes, Tommy, in moderation, of course … As you can see, I’m still as fit as I was in the old days.”\nThe clock of the Kneipe chimed eleven o’clock. Coughing apologetically, Peppi said he had to return to the station. His face brightened when Dad suggested they remain in touch.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-devil-in-munich/chapter-1/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"1-the-platform-phenomenon\"\u003e1.

Fastening my scarf to keep out the crisp air of a typical dawn in Zermatt, I walked briskly up the platform and got in. As often before, I breathed the clean air in deeply and with satisfaction. The absence of fuel driven motorcars was a blessing.\nThe electric car driver, who was also the sole concierge of the modest establishment, manoeuvred his ramshackle vehicle adroitly through the narrow and winding lanes of my favourite Swiss resort. I observed with a grim smile that for him, too, time had not stood still: his wrinkles had deepened and his hair had turned silver grey. Bestowing on me the smile reserved for old customers, he carried my suitcase up the stairs to the reception counter.\n“Good morning, Herr Professor. You did reserve a room overlooking the Zermattschein Hotel?” the fair receptionist let her surprise show.\n“For the first two days only,” I clarified. “After that I’d like to move to a room facing the Matterhorn”.\n“Room 4, which you like so much, will be available,” she confirmed. “But the room for today and tomorrow faces the street.”\n“It’s alright; as long as I can watch the entrance to the Zermattschein. I want to witness the arrival of an old friend!”\n“Very well then; but it’ll be noisy: the delivery carts start to pass by from about six in the morning.”\n“For these two days I’ll stand it,” I assured her.\n2. Vigil by the Window Up in the comfortable room, I shed the clothes I had worn for the train ride from Geneva and slipped into my comfortable dressing gown. Leaving the window slightly ajar, so as to let in some fresh air, I assumed my vigil. The elegant pergola of the Zermattschein spread right in front of me. Nobody could enter or leave the trendy hotel without passing through my line of vision. Was Pilkin, with whom I had made a rendezvous in Zermatt some forty years ago, going to come? When we last met both of us were young men in our early twenties. If he kept our appointment, would I recognise him?\nThe first electric car to arrive in front of the porch unloaded a group of well dressed Eastern tourists conversing in what I thought was Hokkien. Although one of them was a man in his sixties, with a huge bulk, a ruddy face and a loud voice, he could, obviously, not be my old class mate. Like myself, Pilkin would have lost his youthful appearance. But Occidental features remain discernible from Oriental.\nMy reflections were interrupted by the arrival of another quaint car. For a while, the two informally dressed women, who alighted from it, looked with admiration at the elegant façade of the Zermattschein. Then their glances switched to the Matterhorn, displayed to its best in the bright morning air.\n“How adorable,” chimed the smaller of them – a dark skinned, thin, girl.\nFocusing on her through my opera glasses I noted she was of Anglo-Indian stock and that she had poor taste in clothes. Her tight jeans, loose blouse and the lavish exposure of skin around her hips would have better suited a teenaged girl.\n“Adorable?” retorted her tall, heavy set and severe looking companion, who appeared out of place in her tight fitting track suit. “I think ‘magnificent’ or ‘grand’ is more like it.”\n“That too; but it’s also adorable, cute and exciting. Don’t you see, Lilly? It looks like a big cock!”\n“Now, now, Joan,” chided Lilly in a protective tone laced with irony, “to you every amorphous mass with a protrusion looks like it!”\nThe rest of their conversation was blotted out by a noisy group of tourists, who alighted from another electric car. But, even so, the brief exchange I had overheard drove my thoughts back to the past. In his heyday, Pilkin – whose real name used to be Chayim Rosenberg – would have been glad to engage in a friendly conversation with Joan.\nIndeed, Pilkin used to respond favourably to the many winks and tender smiles bestowed on him by the fair sex! Somehow, despite his enormous mass, unsightly appearance and uncouth mannerism, women adored him! They dismissed his wild gesticulations and his often doddering, unsteady, gait – for which he was nicknamed ‘the little elephant’ – as mild affectations. And many of the girls who withstood my friend’s eccentricities fell for his ruddy face, zest for life and optimistic outlook. Pilkin, I had concluded, titillated the maternal instincts of homely maids-in-waiting and was considered a good treat in bed by glamour women. I felt confident that not-so-young Joan would have been keen to share her problems with him.\nThe next guest of the Zermattschein arrived in one of the picturesque, electrically driven, taxis of the secluded resort. Obviously, he had been too impatient to await the arrival in the station of one the hotel’s own vehicles. As the driver unloaded three expensive suitcases, his passenger viewed the hotel with overt suspicion.\n“Are you sure this is the Zermattschein?” he asked in a loud, metallic New York accent, which contrasted sadly with the neatly cut suit and conservative tie, worn by successful North American fund managers.\n“Of course it is,” replied the driver urbanely.\n“But I was told it’s the best hotel in town!”\n“It is,” the driver assured him soothingly. “The Zermattschein is the only ‘five star plus’ hotel in Zermatt, Sir!”\n“Don’t you have a Hilton or a Conrad here?” asked the fund manager querulously.\n“We do not. But the Zermattschein is excellent, let me tell you.”\n“Oh well, I suppose it’ll have to do,” answered the other and, without tipping the driver who had placed the suitcases in front of the concierge’s porch, proceeded to the entrance.\nHaving observed him conscientiously, I concluded he was as tall and as heavy set as Pilkin. His voice, too, was similar and Pilkin was a sufficiently good mimic to have acquired a New York accent and, perhaps, even the coarse mannerism. The fund manager, though, boasted a beaked, Jewish, nose. Pilkin, in contrast, was endowed with a flat snub nose. That, and my friend’s light hair and blue eyes, had provided a rich source of jokes about the sharp contrast between his Slavic features and his traditional Jewish Zionist outlook.\nPilkin’s deep resentment of such remarks surfaced one morning, during our third year in secondary school, when we studied a medieval text about the conversion to Judaism of the Kingdom of the Kesars. After the class, one of our self-appointed jesters observed gleefully that, far from being a descendant of King David, Pilkin’s lineage could be traced to the Caucasus . It took the joint efforts of two of our strongest classmates and of my soothing words to keep the enraged Pilkin from hauling himself on the offender, whose mouth had fallen wide open at my friend’s extreme reaction!\nThe guests who emerged in front of the Zermattschein from the next few cars were of no interest to me. They comprised young holidaymakers, middle aged Australians and New Zealanders and, to my surprise, one family from a Gulf country.\nMy reflections of the past were, however, rekindled by a group of stylish Japanese tourists, whose suave mannerism and elegant deportment contrasted with the mass produced movie cameras they carried. Their unaccustomed bearings made me recall Pilkin’s excitement when the two of us went to see Rashomon [a famous Japanese film], accompanied by attractive though heavy set Shosh Levi, with her lush black hair, sparkling black eyes and mellow yet not seductive voice. Pilkin, who was even then dreaming of a career on the stage, was fascinated by the alien projection of a single story as seen by three different characters. He conceded that the embryonic idea could be traced to Euripides’ late plays. He insisted, nevertheless, that the brilliant photography of the radical Japanese production and the surrealist effect of the ephemeral stage, had opened the door to a new era in the theatre. Shosh and I, the conservative sticklers to the Gutenberg culture, smiled tolerantly.\n3. A Glimpse of Rabbi Zohar A glance at my watch revealed it was getting close to noon. I sensed that, for the time being, I might as well give up my vigil. To economise on time, Pilkin had made a habit of arriving at his destination either well before noon or late in the evening. Unless he had arrived in Zermatt before me, he was unlikely to turn up till the end of the day or early next morning.\nI was placing my opera glasses in their case, when my eye was caught by an apparition. A Hassid, in 18th century East European clothes, emerged from the fashionable hotel across the narrow lane. His black silk caftan, broad old fashioned matching hat and his long even if tidy white beard, complemented by curly side burns, reminded me of the ultra orthodox Neturei Karta sect. During my years in Jerusalem, that sect had been a source of derisive remarks made not only by an assimilated Viennese Jew like myself but even by the far more traditional and quite observant Chayim Rosenberg alias Pilkin. “When religion turns fanatic it becomes uncivilised,” he used to say, bestowing on any Hassid and Boibricks [extremely orthodox] we encountered dark glances exuding revulsion.\nWith just as strong an antipathy, I watched how the anachronistically clad Hassid proceeded slowly to the gate of the Zermattschein, his immense frame supported by a smart walking stick. He was about to turn into the lane, when a young porter came rushing after him.\n“Rabbi Zohar,” he said respectfully, “we just got some really nice Salmon trout. The Chef asks: would you like one for dinner and do you want it steamed or can he use a new recipe he just got from Paris?”\n“Please tell the Chef,” replied the Rabbi warmly, in a New York accent as pronounced as the American fund manager’s, “that I trust his masterly skills. He is a real virtuoso. I look forward to the treat he is preparing for me! You do pamper me up here!”\n“It is a pleasure, Rabbi Zohar. We are honoured to have you here.”\n“The pleasure is all mine,” replied the Rabbi benignly and, resuming his slow but steady stroll, walked through the gate. His grin and eager expression reminded me of Pilkin. A similar smile of anticipation used to descend on his boyish face when we made our way to a Pita Falafel stall in Disengoff Street or to one of our favourite eateries.\nGluttony, I reflected, occupied a special place amongst human vices. If you succumbed to one of the other seven mortal sins, such as pride or avarice, you could readily become a target of hatred or contempt. In contrast, the over indulgence of the dandified gourmand was met with raised eyebrows or, at worst, with patronising sniggers.\n4. A Trip to Furi “Any luck?” asked the receptionist when I placed the key on her desk on my way out.\n“None” I told her, “my friend must have arrived before me or, perhaps, will come tomorrow.”\n“Are you sure he’ll stay in the Zermattschein?”\n“If he can afford it: he likes his comforts. But look, can you please find out later in the day if he has booked a table for tomorrow’s dinner?”\n“Under what name?”\n“Mine!”\n“Yours??”\n“Yes, that was the arrangement: made some forty years ago! He was to book the table in my name for 7.00 p.m. at the Zermattschein!”\n“I’ll give them a ring later,” she said, trying hard to hide her amusement.\nA number of chair lifts transported eager visitors to skiing resorts and hiking walks high above Zermatt. The furthest up the slope was known as Kleinmatterhorn. I had never ventured to go as high: the air was too thin so that any person suffering from blood circulation problems was at risk. Nowadays, with serious blood pressure problems, most spots were out of my reach. Still, the altitude of first spot, Furi, was just about 1870 metres above sea level. My GP assured me that the risk involved in such an ascent was negligible.\nI had visited Furi often, both during the trip with Pilkin and in later years. It could be reached by a lengthy walk up-hill or by a 15 minutes ride in a chair lift. When I alighted, my heavy breathing firmed my resolve not to go to higher up. When, after a few minutes, my slight giddiness was over, I got up from my bench and took one of the tracks I had come to know over the years. After a while, I spotted the American fund manager and thought it best to proceed in a different direction. As I passed a bend, I saw Joan and Lilly, who were once again chatting away.\nHoping to eavesdrop on some juicy bits, I stole in their direction only to discover they were discussing mundane clauses in standard foreign exchange contracts of the type used in our own legal practice in Singapore.\n“But, Lilly,” protested Joan, “this silly clause makes no sense at all; it’s rubbish!”\n“I know,” sighed Lilly patiently, “but the clients like it; and it can do no harm. So why not simply leave it in? Be smart, Joan – don’t rock the boat!”\nJoan gave in reluctantly: “Oh very well.”\nSo Joan and Lilly were London lawyers, taking a break in Zermatt. Yet they were finding it impossible to leave their office behind! Chuckling, I turned on my heels and nearly ran into the arms of the Hassid, Rabbi Zohar. Both of us muttered apologies, followed by a brief exchange on the splendours of the discreet mountain resort. The twinkle in Rabbi Zohar’s blue eyes did much to abate my antagonistic feelings. For a fanatic, he seemed strangely good humoured and relaxed.\nAfter a lavish lunch in a new bistro, I walked slowly downhill back to Pension Kegel. A brief note, in the receptionist’s unformed handwriting, advised that no table in my name had been booked in the Zermattschein. Trying hard to hide my disappointment, I climbed up the stairs to my room. Has Pilkin reneged on our arrangement? Next evening I was bound to find out!\n5. Reminiscing The thought that Pilkin might have had a change of heart disrupted my afternoon siesta. For a number of years I had not heard from him. Then, just a few months ago, he sent me a Jewish New Year card. A scrawl at its foot read: “see you in Zermatt as planned”. It confirmed that Pilkin had not forgotten. But could some unforeseen event have induced him to back out?\nAffectionately, I recalled the early days in our Secondary School in Masor Street in Central Tel Aviv, called ‘Tichon Ironi A’ (literally meaning “High School 1” and fondly nicknamed “TA.1”). The fetish of our fundamentally liberal, even if somewhat traditional, institution was scholastic achievement. Pupils were subjected to four years of rigorous studies. In their first two years, they had to cover basic courses in the arts and in the sciences. In their third year, pupils had to choose between the Humanist Stream and the Scientific Stream. The emphasis in the former was on History, Literature and Biblical Studies. Classics, alas, were not taught. The main subjects in the latter stream were Advanced Mathematics, Theoretical Physics and Organic Chemistry. All pupils were, however, required to study the art of writing and composition. Further, in addition to the subjects in the stream chosen, each of us had to take at least one subject from the other stream.\nIn line with its emphasis on excellence, TA.1 admitted only the best leavers of primary schools from all suburbs in Tel Aviv. Background, status and family connections were not given weight in the selection process. What mattered was the applicant’s studying technique and his potential for success in a professional or academic career.\nI had come from a boys’ school in prosperous middle class Melchett Street whilst Chayim (Pilkin) was one of the few to be admitted from a school in the south of Tel Aviv, in the vicinity of ramshackle Schechunat Ha’Tikva.\nThis, in itself, would not have created a gulf between us. In those pioneering days Israel was egalitarian. The problem lay more in a cultural demarcator. Chayim’s grandparents had migrated to Palestine from Eastern Europe. They and their offspring were conversant in Polish, Yiddish and Hebrew. They were reasonably observant without, at the same time, being truly orthodox (“Froom” in the slang of those days). Chayim’s mother, for instance, lit candles on Friday evening. But she had no compunction about switching on electricity on Saturday – the Sabbath.\nAll in all, Chayim’s religious orientation was moderate. He did not grow sideburns and did not wear a Talith. Still, unlike most of our schoolmates, he covered his head with a scalp cap – a Yarmolka – in our biblical studies lessons, generally observed the dietary laws known as Kashruth and occasionally went to prayers on the eve of the Sabbath. I recalled vividly how, on one occasion, I saw him in Allenby street on the last day of the Feast of Tabernacle. He was walking back from his Synagogue in the company of his young brother, who was proudly carrying the customary cardboard flag, with its rich display of biblical themes and with the remnants of a colourful candle attached to its post.\nMy parents home had a different flavour. As a middle aged couple, they had to escape from Vienna on the eve of Austria’s annexation by Germany – the Anschluß. Still, my parents’ language, values and orientation remained those of Austria of the first decades of the 20th century. Ethnically, of course, they were Jewish but, like all their assimilated compatriots, they had shed all cultural ties with their origin. Traditional Jewish homes like Chayim’s were just as alien to them as Yiddish and Polish.\nMy own outlook was similar to theirs: jibes about religion came to me naturally! In the circumstances, during our first year in TA.1, communications between Chayim and myself remained confined to occasional polite nods and the usual exchanges in classes. Even in the regular picnics – ‘Kumsitzes’ in the slang of our era – the two of us did not mix. He was the heart and soul of every gathering and party. I was a shy boy, glad to stick to the fringes.\nAll the same, I did from time to time step over to congratulate Chayim when he entertained us with one of his sparkling performances, usually a comic scene from a popular drama or the recital of a modern Hebrew poem. It was at the end of one such performance, when Chayim was swaying drunk with success, that on my subtle promptings he was nicknamed ‘Pilkin’ (the little elephant). A few weeks later he took his revenge and had me dubbed ‘Bushi’ (a befitting tag for a shy lad). Needless to say, both names stuck!\nNone of this was conducive to the creation of meaningful links. Fortunately, the two of us had more fruitful communications in class. As both of us disliked science, we had enrolled in the humanist stream. Yet we were not in competition . My interests were mainly in history and in philosophy. Pilkin loved literature and excelled in Arabic and in Talmudic studies. Frequently, we stepped to one another’s aid when a teacher gave us a hard time.\nWhen the prodding came from the English Language Master, both of us were usually saved by pretty Shosh, who was engrossed in Shelley, Keats and Browning. It was only natural that these occasional acts of help forged a bond between the three of us. Yet another drive to friendship was exercised by gluttony that bound both Pilkin and me to Shosh. When our scientifically orientated classmates amused themselves by solving problems of calculus or by memorising chemical formulas, the three of us stole away to a nearby Pita Falafel or ice cream store for pleasures accessible to common people.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/reunion-in-zermatt/chapter-1/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"1-pension-kegel\"\u003e1.

Whilst both are imbued with tolerance and understanding they are nevertheless distinct. One approach is that of the tolerant traditional observer who follows the commands of his faith but is not perturbed by the transgressions and by the non-conformity of fellow Jews. The other approach is that of a sceptic who doubts many of the tenets of the faith as well as the Bible’s historicity and does not observe commands he fails to understand. His adherence to Judaism is based on his acceptance of the ethnic affiliation of members of the community. He is tolerant of the view of orthodox believers, provided they do not attempt to force him to adopt their orientation.\nLoeb Zohar (alias Chayim Rosenberg, then Rosenne), who is the hero of this book, symbolizes the former group. He is a kind hearted person but is not portrayed as infallible. Two of Loeb’s friends (Bushi and Uri) typify the second group. Both are aware of Loeb’s belief and would go out of their way so as not to offend his sensitivities. Loeb, in turn, disregards their transgressions unless they set out to hurt him.\nLoeb Zohar is a fictitious person. In molding him I drew on the lives of people I knew. I only hope that I have not created an unbelievable person. Bushi and Uri express my own views. None of us is a fanatic. We are doubters (or skeptics) but have remained in the fold.\nLoeb marries twice. In his first marriage he is the effective caregiver who helps his wife, Galya, to find a niche in the Israeli theatre world. His second wife, the American Jewess Yentl, assumes the role of Pygmalion. Her purpose in life is to encourage her husband to arrive at the destination she sets for him. Without her guiding hand he might not have arrived.\nAnother central figure is Ronnie Eyal, Galya’s second husband and Loeb’s devoted friend. Ronnie is a holocaust victim who tries hard to ignore the past. Regrettably, it has left its mark and occasionally catches up with him.\nA recurring topic in the book is the clash of traditional Judaism and the secular world surrounding it. Tacitly, it is conceded that the modern image of the universe – as elaborated in scientific tracts – is irreconcilable with blind acceptance of religious dogma. A midway may exist but dogmatisms block the corridor leading to it. Loeb is aware of its existence but, being a loyal traditionalist, does not change his route. Bushi and Uri draw Chinese Walls between Judaism and science. Whilst in the synagogue they adhere to dogma; outside it they go their own ways.\nLoeb experiences the Suez Crisis, the Six-Day War and the Yom Kippur War. He narrates his personal experiences in each but does not deal with the political issues involved. In the last of these wars, he is a morale booster.\nThe book also touches on the Kabbala, the mystic element of Judaism, and on the compilation of its existing norms. Safed (Zfat צפת) – one of the centres of Judaism – is given its appropriate place and significance.\nQuotations from the Old Testament are taken from the translation appearing in The Holy Scriptures (Koren Publishers Jerusalem Ltd., 2008).\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novels/bright-lion/preface/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe object of Bright Lion is to compare two approaches to Judaism.

As I leafed through it, my glance fell on an envelope posted in Colombo. Was it a request for a reference from one of my recent Sri Lankan students? I was about to slice the cover open when Shamsiah’s call reminded me that my Banking Law class was to commence in five minutes. Reluctantly, I dropped the letter back on my desk, picked up my notes and hurried to my seminar room.\nWhen I came back after some two hours, the envelope had slipped my mind. I recalled it only when it dropped off the table when I tried to put my notes in order. Shrugging my shoulders, I tore it open, only to realise that the writer was the widow of my late friend, Ranjan Jeyaratne. Her message was plain. Would I kindly write a short note to be included in a volume planned to commemorate her late husband?\nDeeply perturbed, I stared into the void surrounding me. Ranjan Jeyaratne had been shot dead by a gunman in what had turned out to be my friend’s last rally. His assassination had been reported on the BBC. I got the news on my car radio when I drove home from downtown Singapore. The information shook me, but my feelings were mixed. Ranjan had quitted Sri Lanka’s ruling party. He had not crossed the floor by joining the opposition; he ran as an independent presidential candidate. His former party feared he would split the vote.\nRanjan was too shrewd a man to overlook the risks involved. He knew it would be best to wait; but his ambition spurred him on. In the end, he had paid dearly for his courage and resolve.\nMost of Ranjan’s contemporaries grieved when they got the news. He had been a charming fellow and a loyal friend. I had good reasons to be grateful to him for my appointment to an assistant lectureship at Singapore’s Law School and for his many acts of kindness during the years we knew one another. The blood on his hands – the atrocities perpetrated by his troops in the Tamil region of Jaffna – would not have quenched my affection and gratitude. Politics, I knew, was a dirty game.\nWhat had disturbed me was Ranjan’s extreme self-centredness. It had driven him to some personal vendettas which militated against my belief in ‘live and let live’. All the same, and notwithstanding his questionable odyssey, I continued to see him as he had been in our Oxford days.\nFor a long time, I remained seated with the letter of Ranjan’s widow in my hand. Should I accede to her request? My heart whispered that a refusal would be both shameful and ungracious. My mind steered me in the opposite direction. Would it be proper to compose a eulogy endorsing Ranjan’s acts? How could I possibly close my eyes to his evil side?\nTorn between these diametrically opposed sentiments, I placed the letter and my notes in my briefcase and got ready to leave. My late friend Tay Fung-Shou – encapsulated in a porcelain figurine affectionately called Alfie and placed in my choice trophies cabinet – was bound to find a way out of the dilemma.\nAs always, Pat’s barrage of complaints commenced soon after I stepped through our door. She had quarrelled with her sister, had scolded the grocer for being late with his deliveries, and one light in the sitting room was out of order. Reasoning with her was pointless: she would have the last word. When, at long last, she went to watch a Cantonese soap on her favourite television channel, I slipped into my antiques room. My face brightened when I viewed my treasures.\n“You always bow like Angmoh, Mr. Mid-Yeast Tourist,” Alfie grinned gleefully from his shelf in my porcelain cabinet. “Like they say: Angmoh is Angmoh, my friend. Seng Seng [Chimpanzee], he also kowtow; but always he ape!”\n“Thanks for the compliment,” I retorted, getting ready to give verbal battle.\n“Now, now,” observed Alfie victoriously. “Show temper is bad manners. But Angmoh not know better!”\nHe had embarked on the banter we used to enjoy when he had been alive and kicking. I recalled vividly our endless repartee, and the amused glances bestowed on us by his young daughter, Yuan-Ming, who, even as a grown up, continued to address me as “Uncle”.\nMy friendship with Tay and Yuan-Ming was a gift of Fortuna. She had guided me to Tay Antiques during my early days in Singapore. The proprietor, Tay Fung-Shuo, had opened his shop in the heart of Chinatown after turning his back on a promising career in one of London’s leading museums. Purporting to be a run-of-the-mill antiques dealer, Tay used to wear a Chinese silk suit with a jacket buttoned up to the chin; and he addressed his customers in an awkward, heavily accented, pidgin. It took me a long time to discover that Mr. Tay was a graduate of Cambridge and London universities and that, under the guise of his United Kingdom alias of ‘Dr Alfred Cheng’, he had published a series of books on Chinese art.\nIn due course, I started to visit his shop regularly in order to pursue my interest in Chinese ceramics. Tay obliged and, in the course of our friendship, enlightened me. Our lengthy – often exhausting – tours of the world of Eastern art had fine-tuned my perception of my beloved European porcelain. Tay’s brilliant insights sharpened my ability to evaluate art.\nAt the end of our last tutorial session, when both of us knew a malignant disease would pluck him off before we had the chance to meet again, he gave me a royal gift: the Bowing Harlequin modelled in Meissen in 1741. It appeared only right to dub the figurine ‘Alfie’. Before long I started to chat with it. After a while, the real Alfie and his porcelain alter ego merged in my mind. It was, therefore, befitting that our conversations were held in the special variant of pidgin we had developed during his lifetime. Occasionally, though, Alfie reverted to plain English. In a subtle manner the switch involved a rebuke, as if the speaker had said: “Stop making much ado about nothing”.\n“So today you have problem,” Alfie spoke in a kinder tone.\n“How you know?”\n“Your face open book, my friend; and I good reader!”\nAlfie listened attentively. He was, of course, aware of my friendship with Ranjan Jeyaratne. Both he and his charming little daughter had taken a dislike to Ranjan, tolerating him only for my sake. When I mentioned Ranjan’s sad end to Yuan-Ming – by then relishing an artistic Avante Garde existence in California – her response was direct and abrupt: “He got what he deserved; so don’t you fret, Uncle”. Alfie would have been less outspoken.\nToday Alfie’s porcelain alter ego was, once again, prepared to humour me by disguising his dislike for the deceased politician. But, even so, he let his displeasure show as soon as I finished my tale.\n“But you, Mr. Mid-Yeast Tourist, why you make mountain out of molehill?”\n“Why you say so?”\n“Your friend’s widow she ask for help: so why problem?”\n“You don’t think have three options, three bad options, Mr. Tay?”\n“Tell me.”\n“Option one: not answer. But this is escape; too ugly.”\n“So not option,” retorted Alfie.\n“Second option: write nice letter – say Ranjan he great man – but is pack of lies.”\n“And you not liar; you honest,” smirked Alfie. “And last option?”\n“Tell her truth?”\n“Oh yes,” Alfie retorted with gusto. “You say: ‘Dear Mrs So and So, your husband not bad politician and is good friend but also is rake, rogue and womaniser’. Splendid: you think can write?”\n“No, Alfie,” I conceded. “Too gross. So perhaps not best answer?”\n“The difficulty lies in your classification of the options,” said Alfie, reverting to his scholarly ego. “In reality you have only two choices: to reply or to keep mum; and we have ruled the latter out!”\n“The only question is what to say when I reply. Unfortunately, the real story and the myth are incompatible!”\n“If you paint them on one canvas, they are,” agreed Dr Cheng. “But why don’t you compose two letters – one telling the truth and another best described as ‘the great leader myth’?”\n“Sending them under separate cover?” I asked, still perplexed.\n“A poor way out if you send both to the widow. But you better compose them for different audiences. Of course, the two must be reconcilable. But their tones may differ; and you can leave out of each canvas that part of the tale not meant for the respective readers.”\n“Isn’t that subterfuge?”\n“Perhaps is. But also trick of great historians,” chuckled Alfie, slipping back into our jargon.\n“Very well,” I conceded, sticking to plain English for the moment. “So, the great leader myth is to be addressed to the widow. To whom should I address the true tale?”\n“To yourself or me,” said Alfie, soberly. “You see, object is get out of your system.”\n“And myth must write first,” I reflected. “Must answer widow soon; and true story I take perhaps two years!”\n“Correct; and is good order – when you write myth you think of Ranjan good side. So perhaps not so much poison in true tale; your glasses kindlier tinted.”\nI spent ten days on my reply to Ranjan’s widow. The final three-page obituary was fit for inclusion in a commemorative tome. It covered Ranjan’s years at Oxford, his performance as a lecturer in Singapore and, to a point, the tale of his rise in the politics of his home country. Superlatives were scarce. The sketch I drew described Ranjan as a good scholar, an accomplished lecturer and an aspiring politician.\nI gave my late friend credit for having been a loyal comrade and a realistic and thoughtful individual. It appeared best not to refer to his appeal to women, to his numerous flirtations and to his first, unhappy and sterile, marriage. The reference to his publications – described as small in volume but sound and meticulously researched – and a mention of his neatly organised and well-presented teaching courses helped me to sidestep his questionable commercial and financial exploits. The only side of his character which I lauded in flowery language was his devotion to his Sinhalese race. Ranjan had often put its cause above his personal interests.\nI concluded my obituary with a banal sentiment: it was a tragedy that Ranjan’s contributions to the cause of his people had been terminated by a bullet fired by a cowardly hooligan. The sentiment was genuine; my affection for Ranjan had remained intact. Still, the myth did not reflect my reservations. But, then, a myth is supposed to draw the hero’s portrait in bright colours.\nHaving re-read the brief myth, I concluded that Ranjan’s widow would find some solace in it and that, in any event, my letter to her would serve the purpose for which I had composed it. A chat with Alfie convinced me further that, although my punches had been pulled as required, I had not compromised the truth. A candid obituary – read side by side with the myth – would shed further light on Ranjan’s life. At the same time, neither tale would give the lie to the other. I hoped that an objective reader, an unbiased stranger, would reach the same conclusion.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/a-candid-obituary/chapter-1/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eMy secretary had arranged the incoming mail in a neat pile.

Reluctantly, I dropped the letter back on my desk, picked up my notes and hurried to my seminar room.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Chapter 1: A Dilemma"},{"content":"1. An Extraordinary Catalogue As the aeroplane steadied on its westward course, I started to skim through the papers respecting the legal entanglement that required my presence in London. Conscience and professional integrity dictated that I peruse the bundle meticulously. I owed this to the friendly law firm that was paying handsomely for my services and for the comfortable seat in the business class section of British Airways’ direct flight from Singapore.\nUsually I should have started to work. I have the stamina and the alertness needed for the perusal of a bulky set of documents. Many a client had benefited from my perseverance. On this occasion, though, I was not up to the task. To start with, I was distracted by the hum of the engines and by the garrulous loudspeaker. In addition, my thoughts kept straying back to Yuan Ming. She had promised to fly to Singapore immediately after the close of her exhibition in Los Angeles. In about four weeks I was going see her again. But this eagerly anticipated moment might be delayed if my case dragged on. The thought was perturbing.\nI was aware that my fears were largely unfounded. Bill Riggs, a former colleague of our Law Faculty in Singapore, had assured me that the case would be over within two weeks. All the same, I kept fretting. Experience had taught me that some of Her Majesty’s Counsel could be disturbingly long winded. At an honorarium of £800 per hour their tendency was understandable. Unfortunately, a Professor of Law like me, flown in as an expert witness on banking practice, was not in a position to stem the flow of their eloquence.\nFor a while I tried to distract myself by reverting to the bundle of depositions, of illegible photocopies of muddled letters and of the other party’s expert report. Then, with a shrug of my shoulders, I gave up the uneven struggle. Replacing the papers in my briefcase I took out the item I had been looking forward to examining during the flight: the catalogue of a forthcoming Christie’s auction of the contents of an elegant residence near Woodstock. The catalogue had arrived a few days before my flight. Although I had skimmed through the colour plates of the available Continental porcelain pieces, I had not studied the handsome booklet as meticulously as, I sensed, it deserved.\nWithin a short while I became immersed in the catalogue. Although my own collection comprises mainly mid-European ceramics and prints, I have a genuine love for all antiques. The reason is not a wish to travel back in time. I have no illusions about the quality of life in Europe of days past. But the antique furniture, the paintings, the sculptures and the ceramics, which go under the hammer in our modern sales rooms, are manifestations of the artistic achievements of their respective eras. They are also of the highest quality. After all, who would wish to preserve a poorly constructed piece of furniture or an ill conceived porcelain figurine?\nThe instant catalogue lent support to my sentiment. Every room in the stately home was filled with fine antiques. My admiration was invoked by an elegant 19th century arm chair. The desk, too, was exciting, with beautifully shaped legs and a delightful leather covered centre. The mahogany display cabinet, in the drawing room, made my mouth water. It would constitute an excellent home for my Meissen figurines.\nFor a while, I remained captivated by the ambience of the rooms. Would it not be exciting to own a property like this estate? Then, unexpectedly, an inner voice – the voice of my sceptic Viennese alter ego – broke the spell by raising a basic question. Had this splendid house been a real home, in which a person had lived and worked, loved and hated, or was it a show piece: a mere front or sparkling façade?\nOnce again my eyes traversed the photographs of the individual rooms. Somehow, everything appeared too tidy, too neat, to be real. I had to concede that, to an extent, this effect was produced by the conscientious efforts of Christie’s cleaners and polishers. But the ephemeral air was not entirely of their making. To me, each room appeared too perfect to be genuine. The broad double bed with its muslin curtains was too fine to be slept in regularly. The library, which had only two sparsely stacked bookcases, had a number of period chairs and a sofa; but there were no library steps. The most remarkable room, though, was the bathroom. The huge tub in its midst reminded me of a small Roman spa I had seen in Trier, and the 18th century porcelain basin and pitcher, placed beside the modern hand basin, struck me as out of place in a modern house.\nBy the time the steward approached my seat with the evening meal, I had reached my conclusions. I had traversed a stylish mausoleum, occupied by an owner who stayed there without dwelling in it. Did he regard himself a caretaker, like the uniformed attendants who guide a group of tourists through the rooms of palaces of kings and princes of times past.\nAs soon as I finished consuming the plain evening meal, I turned back to the bundle of documents related to my forthcoming appearance as an expert witness in London. After a concentrated effort on a number of pages drawn to my attention in my instructions, I noted some damaging inconsistencies in the other party’s correspondence. Shortly thereafter I discovered to my chagrin that our case rested on an equally shaky foundation. I knew, of course, that the two financial institutions, locked in the instant battle, adhered to a well known business philosophy, based on taking advantage of each available loophole and technicality in a bargain gone sour. It did not elate me to be of assistance to one of them. I even knew that my own policy of accepting remunerative banking cases without regard to my principals’ mercantile morality tarnished me with the very brush I applied to them. These thoughts had, frequently, induced me to vow that a particularly unmeritorious bundle was the last one to be handled by me. Up to now, though, my resolve had failed as soon as I discovered yet another exciting piece of Meissen, of Vienna or of Frankenthal in a new catalogue. To buy it I needed extra funds. To overcome my scruples, I kept reminding myself that the Code of Ethics of our profession encouraged me to accept a brief as long as I was able to conduct myself without violating any legal norm.\nThis established principle of ethics, and the covetous glances I kept bestowing on a yellow-ground milk jug produced and decorated in Meissen in 1735, kept spurring me for the next three hours of the flight. By the time the information chart, displayed on the digital screen, showed that we were approaching India, I was through with my work. Having pinpointed the information that was going to form the basis of my supportive expert’s opinion, I congratulated myself – in sheer disregard of my qualms – on a job well done. Replacing the bundle once again in my briefcase, I turned back to the catalogue. The pages setting out the European porcelain items now had my full attention.\nI had discussed the yellow milk jug, that had caught my eye during my initial perusal of the catalogue in Singapore, with Yuan Ming. During the last few years, I rang her up regularly, whenever she was in the Los Angeles, from her own spacious apartment in Katong.\nMy last call to her had taken place on the day preceding my flight to London. Having driven to the condominium after my last class for the day, I worked for a while in the study, which used to belong to her late father, the antiques dealer and internationally acclaimed scholar Tay Fang-Shuo alias Dr Alfred Cheng, M.A., Ph.D. (Cantab.). At 10.00 p.m., when day was ready to break in Los Angeles, I dialled her number.\n“Did I wake you up?” I had asked anxiously, when she picked up the receiver.\n“You know you haven’t; I’ve been waiting for your call for the last hour; what were you up to, Uncle?”\nYuan Ming – presently an attractive woman in her thirties – had dubbed me her ‘special uncle’ when she was a little girl. It had been a mark of her affection: there was no family tie between us. I had been her father’s closest friend – not his brother or brother-in-law. Out of habit, though, she kept addressing me in the same manner even after she had grown up. She knew also that I cherished my title.\n“Sitting at your Dad’s desk with my new Christie’s catalogue; I didn’t want to ring you before 6 o’clock in the morning!”\n“And what did you discover in your new catalogue?”\n“I just looked at a few pieces; one is a lovely Meissen yellow-ground milk jug with paintings of a church by the river and ships loading at the quay. I like it; and – God alone knows why – it looks familiar. Still, they say the handle has a hairline crack; and they estimate it at £2,000 to £3,000. A bit high for an imperfect piece?”\n“I can get that crack fixed for you. If you still don’t want it, bid for me; you can go up to £4,000. But why didn’t you look at all the pieces; you always do?”\n“I just couldn’t concentrate!”\n“Why?”\n“I was counting the days to your next visit. And I kept thinking of our last afternoon at the pool. You swim beautifully but – even so – I caught you in the end; and I’m waiting to challenge you again!”\nI had blurted the words out despite a desperate attempt to control my tongue. Yuan Ming was busy with the preparations for her forthcoming exhibition. I knew that two of her pieces required final touches and yet a third was incomplete. My seriously minded alter ego upbraided me for the pressure I was bringing on her. The truth, though, was that I yearned to see her again.\nTo my relief, I heard her peels of laughter, the merry chimes I remembered so well from the gone bye days when an nine years old Yuan Ming, sitting on my lap in her father’s shop, was amused by my attempts to address her in Mandarin.\n“You only caught me because you cornered me when I tried to dive under you; and you pretended not to see I was turning!”\n“Not the way to talk to your old swimming instructor; you may be faster than me now; but I can still outmanoeuvre you any time!” I bragged, stung to the quick.\n“So you say, Uncle; so you keep telling to yourself,” she teased me. \u0026ldquo;Well, we’ll see in four weeks time, Mr Swimming Instructor; I’ll sure give you a run for your money!”\n“We’ll see,” I conceded, and then, much more sedately and once again in control of my emotions: “But, look, are you all set for your exhibition? Everything under control?”\n“The two sketches are OK now; I have tarted them up nicely. But I can’t finish the last oil; I just can’t!” she said in a changed voice.\n“Why not? It’s brilliant; honestly – one of your very best!”\n“I’ll finish it in Singapore,” she said after a long pause.\n“But then you won’t be able to exhibit the painting this time?” I said, trying to conceal my disappointment.\n“Never mind; it’ll be in my next show” she said, adding with a shrug: “My admirers will have to wait for another six months!”\nOnce again, there was a pause. I had nothing to say. Yuan Ming had the ability and the talent. She was a fine artist. From time to time, though, she lacked the zeal. To my relief, she broke the silence before it became oppressive:\n“And look, Uncle, you’ll see the initial sketch when we meet.”\n“In another four weeks!” I sighed, cursing myself for the anxious cord that crept into my voice.\n“They’ll pass soon, with you rushing about in busy London. But look here Uncle, what is really the matter? Why are you so agitated?”\n“It’s the court appearance” I admitted. “Bill Riggs assures me the case will be over in two weeks; but what if it drags on?”\n“So that’s it” I could hear her laughter. “What an ace you are, Uncle! Then I’ll simply fly to London.”\n“But you told me you had to make a stop in Shanghai and then settle your new deal in Hong Kong or Singapore!”\nI was now alluding to Yuan Ming’s second occupation. Even prior to the onset of her father’s fatal illness, she had taken the antiques business into her own hands. Unlike him, she was prepared to take risks and, from time to time, flew to China to clinch deals involving the smuggling out of rare pieces.\n“So in the worst case we’ll meet two or three days later than expected; and so I’ll stay longer; and if I come to London we could also spend a few days in Vienna.”\n“That would be superb” I confirmed enthusiastically.\nI was now overcome by elation. The prospect of a trip to my old home town was exciting. Although my family had had to flee to Palestine at the eve of the Second World War, I had always preferred the Austrian milieu of my parents’ home in Tel Aviv to the harsher Israeli spirit that reigned outside it. Despite certain childhood memories – including the demolition of my mother’s porcelain collection by uniformed young men – I had visited Vienna several times after the end of the War, mainly to spend some time with my father who had returned to it in 1951. After a while, I started to feel at home and enjoyed myself.\nIn recent years, Yuan Ming and I had wonderful breaks in Vienna. She had become alarmingly fond of the Heuriger – the newly matured wine – served in Grinzing with light meals to the sound of music played by local bands. Waltzing with her, to their tunes, was an exhilarating even if exhausting experience: I was, after all, her senior by thirty years. Occasionally, her enthusiasm invoked the spontaneous applause of fellow patrons, who had remained seated comfortably at their tables with their glasses.\n“That’s settled then,” she said happily. “But, honestly, is the case likely to drag on? Bill Riggs is a pretty reliable chap, isn’t he?”\n“I suppose I’m getting over anxious” I confessed. “It’s just that I hate the very thought of missing my niece even for a single day.”\n“It won’t happen. So don’t you worry. And, Uncle, you better take the catalogue with you to steady your nerves during the flight. And I forgot to ask, when is your flight?”\n“Tomorrow evening; I’ll ring you from the plane!” I promised.\n“That will be lovely” she replied. Then, instantly, she changed her mind: “No, you better ring me from the hotel in London: you can, of course, use my flat but I’m sure your clients have put you up in a five stars establishment.”\n“They have” I told her. “See you soon then; and take care.”\n“You too, Uncle; and don’t you forget to ring your wife as soon as you get to the hotel. She too deserves attention.” Her merry laughter echoed pleasantly in my ears even after she had replaced the receiver.\nFor a while, and in plain defiance of new torrent of information emanating from the aeroplane’s loudspeakers, I kept relishing the recollection of this short conversation of the previous day. Then, as I stretched myself against my seat, I realised I was exhausted. Switching off the light above my head, I closed my eyes.\n2. A Leading London Banker When I woke up, the stewardess was handing out steaming towels. As I wiped my face, I saw that the catalogue, which I had dropped on the vacant seat next to mine, had fallen open at a page setting out the history of the house near Woodstock and a short biography of its owner. Glancing at it with curiosity, I sat up with a jerk. The owner - Sir Arthur Smithies - was a man I had known well in my days as a research student in Oxford. Years later we had met again, by chance, when I was someone else’s guest at the Athenaeum. We managed to converse for a few minutes and, just before I returned to my host’s table, he showed me the catalogue of a forthcoming auction. The yellow Meissen milk jug was one of the pieces both of us had admired as we leafed quickly through the pages with the mid-European porcelain. As I recalled this encounter, I was momentarily irked by my failure to recognise the jug and, through it, its owner’s identity. The explanation, though, was simple. I thought that Arthur Smithies was still living on his estate near Epping. Indeed, I had kept sending my letters and Christmas cards to that address.\nFor the remaining two hours of the flight my thoughts focused on Sir Arthur Smithies. Our paths had crossed for the first time shortly after I embarked on my research of the law respecting a banking facility known as the documentary letter of credit. Work I had carried out two years earlier on in the course of banking litigation in Tel-Aviv had revealed that my facility was already in use during the first half of the 19th century. But where and when was this commercial technique initiated? Whose brainchild was it? To provide a conclusive answer, I needed access to bank archives. Attaching recommendations of my supervisor and of the Head of my Oxford College, I solicited information from all the London banks whose history stretched back far enough. Most replies were negative. Some explained that their archives had been destroyed during the First or the Second World War. Others regretted that old paper had been recycled.\nAll in all I received only two helpful letters. One, from a private bank, Brownlow Bros., enclosed a bulky tome covering the House’s history. My attention was drawn to a passage describing how the partners had resolved, on 4 March 1820, to obtain Counsel’s opinion about the legal risks involved in the use of documentary credits. The other letter, typed on the elegant stationary of a merchant bank, Crawford \u0026amp; Co., did not provide any specific information. The writer advised me of his own interest in the subject and invited me to have lunch with him in the following week. The signature read: Arthur Smithies, Managing Partner.\nIn 1959, Crawford \u0026amp; Co. had their premises in Birchin Lane off Lombard Street. The drab appearance of their grey building exacerbated my misgivings about my forthcoming interview with their Managing Partner. My letter to them had actually been written as an afterthought. Throughout their long history, commencing at about the middle of the 18th century, the bulk of Crawford \u0026amp; Co.’s business had been conducted with banks on the Continent, principally in Germany, in France and in the Netherlands. My instincts – and such information as was available to me – had directed my hopeful glances to banks active in the Anglo-American trade. I had solicited information from Crawford \u0026amp; Co., and from other banks active in the European trade, because no stone could be left unturned. Looking lugubriously at the front of the building in Birchin Lane, I upbraided myself for having been too meticulous: time was precious and, alas, money was scarce.\nMy dejected mood lightened when I entered the bank. As soon as I mentioned my name to the aging Chief Porter, he ordered one of his subordinates to escort me to a waiting room. When we arrived, a young gentleman, of about my own age, approached us and held out his hand: “I’m Brian Davies; Mr Smithies has asked me to show you around before I take you to his office.”\nLeaving my wet top coat and hat in the cloak room, I followed my guide. We stopped for a while in the well, where a few customers transacted their business at the counters. Looking around me, I realised that Crawford \u0026amp; Co. were a cut above the large retail banks in the City. The aura of spaciousness conjured by the elegantly furbished well contrasted pleasantly with the claustrophobic atmosphere, produced in the City branches of Barclays and of Lloyds Bank by the urge to utilise every square inch. The sense of rush and pressure, created by the shuffling of impatient feet in a queue, was equally absent. As I raised my head, I admired the terraced mezzanine floor, with the protruding offices, that broke the monotony of the high wall separating the marble floor of the well from the ornate ceiling.\n“Quite impressive, isn’t it?” asked Brian Davies.\n“Splendid, I should say” I answered.\n“Wait till you see our boardroom,” he said with a smile, adding: “And there, on the north east side of the mezzanine, are the rooms of the international trade department; there – where the two fellows are peeping down at us. These chaps do like to see a customer’s face before he takes the lift to their little offices. Makes it easier to brave a storm.”\nI grinned politely at the flat joke. After a short tour of the mezzanine floor we took the lift to the second floor. The boardroom was, indeed, grandiose. A plush carpet covered the floor, the chandeliers sparkled with their candle shaped bulbs and the solid, beautifully carved, rosewood table surpassed any piece of furniture I had seen in Oxford. After looking at the traditional English paintings – mainly galleons on stormy seas and hunting scenes – I admired the delightful pink stained pinewood panelling of the walls. Impulsively, I touched it only to give a start: my fingertips transmitted the cool sensation of a smooth marble surface.\n“It does look like wood, doesn’t it,” said Brian Davies, with a satisfied grin.\n“First time I see a terrazzo wall,” I conceded; “it’s beautiful.”\n“It’s also very expensive; time honoured secret process of a firm in Padua. They didn’t allow anyone in during the work.” Pausing for a moment, he added with a thinly veiled sneer: “We had a good year in 1957; so the Partners loosened the purse strings.”\nI had by then concluded that Brian Davies was an Oxford or Cambridge man. His accent and mannerism were unmistakable. As we left the room, I inquired about his College.\n“King\u0026rsquo;s, Cambridge” he said readily. “Quite a few Oxbridge men in this firm. Mr Smithies went to Trinity, Cambridge.”\nBrian Davies showed me few smaller meeting rooms – all neatly even if less lavishly furnished and decorated than the boardroom. We then proceeded to the broad staircase leading to the third floor. For a few seconds I glanced with appreciation at the neat Bokhara carpet. Then I stopped abruptly in my tracks. I had come face to face with a lithograph I had coveted for years.\n“Do you like Toulouse-Lautrec?” I heard Brian Davies’ voice.\n“Very much. He was unique,” I told him.\n“You may be right,” he said; “although, for myself, I prefer some later artists like Picasso and Matisse. We have a few in the Library and some others in our smaller reception rooms. Our French clients appreciate them.” Glancing at his watch, he added: “We must proceed to Mr Smithies’ room now, but I may be able to show them to you some other time.”\nArthur Smithies turned out to be a man in his mid forties. His auburn hair had started to recede but his tall, sparse, figure was not frail. His neat grey suit, carefully pressed business shirt and discreet tie went well with his reserved mannerism and precise mode of speech. His keen brown eyes, though, projected warmth. I sensed, as soon as we shook hands, that he was a pleasant and friendly man.\n“Glad you could make it, Mr Berger” he said. “I’m only sorry we weren’t able to arrange better weather for you.”\n“Oh, I’m getting used to it,” I told him. “And many thanks for asking me for lunch.” Hesitating for a moment, I added: “It was good of you to ask Mr Davies to show me around. You do have splendid rooms.”\n“What did you think of our boardroom?”\n“Magnificent! But I should really congratulate you on the Lautrec lithograph. It’s the first time I have come across this piece outside a museum; and I haven’t seen it in any recent catalogue.”\n“Are you a collector, then?” he asked with genuine interest.\n“In a modest way,” I said, feeling embarrassed. Noticing his own resulting unease, I hurried to explain: “At present, I restrict myself to porcelain; mainly to Meissen and Vienna figurines; but I like the atmosphere of auction rooms and, of course, good catalogues provide a glimpse; some are available at half price after the sale.”\n“I too like Meissen,” he told me, with a smile; “but mainly small vases, ewers and plates: cabinet pieces. What attracts you to figurines?”\n“Some of them - like Kändler’s Harlequins - are really sculptures; and great ones at that.”\n“I think I get your point,” he replied, thoughtfully. “You like the figurines for their own sake – for what they convey to you, don’t you?” Seeing me nod, he proceeded: “Well, I like my pieces to blend with their setting. Meissen plates and ewers look nice on the shelves of a suitable cabinet.”\nAt that point, our conversation lost its impetus. My host was too tactful to ask for further details about the collection of a person in my position. I, in turn, was too shy too persevere; I was also apprehensive of appearing eager to impress.\nTo my relief, Arthur Smithies broke the short silence. Indicating that we ought to proceed to lunch, he inquired whether I observed any dietary rules. Reassured by my response, he led the way to the private room of what he called “our modest in-house restaurant.”\nIt was over an excellent English lunch – smoked salmon, pumpkin soup and a steak and kidney pie – that Arthur Smithies turned to my enquiry.\n“You seem quite certain that documentary letters of credit originated in the Anglo-American trade. You realise that, traditionally, our house has been engaged in trade with the Continent?”\n“I do; but it occurred to me that some Continental merchants might have used Crawford, Fairbairn, Miles \u0026amp; Co. as intermediaries for financing their trade with America.”\nHe had broken into an appreciative smile when I referred to the style used by his firm during the last quarter of the 18th century.\n“Quite possible; it will be interesting to have our records searched; and there is another possibility. Occasionally our house entered into joint ventures with banks active on the American scene, mainly Brownlow Bros. You see, one of our partners married a Miss Brownlow in 1765. So we may be able to provide some information. But tell me please, why are you so interested in the history of letters of credit? With your background in modern bank litigation, I should have expected you to be concerned mainly with the current legal problems?”\nHe listened attentively to my explanation of the connection between the historical background and the relevant modern practical problems. As I proceeded, I noticed that Arthur Smithies recognised some of the 18th and early 19th century court decisions which I discussed. Was he a lawyer by training? For the moment, however, my curiosity had to be suppressed. My immediate task was to secure my host’s assistance. To get it, I had to convince him of the merit of my quest. Encouraged by his supportive demeanour, I went on with my discourse. When I finished, he nodded.\n“Quite a neat analysis, Berger. So you are studying the historical background mainly in order to support your practical arguments?”\n“Precisely,” I confirmed. “My object is to ensure that my points won’t be faulted!”\n“The lawyer’s need to dot the I’s and cross the t’s. His urge to cover his flanks even before a broadside is fired at him; just as you do in the preparation of a complex case for trial.” He had spoken slowly, even guardedly; but his expression manifested approbation. “Your experience in court must have stood you in good stead when you developed your theories.”\n“It has, rather,” I affirmed. “But, if I may ask, you are, obviously, very familiar with legal work?”\n“I was called to the Bar before the War; for a while I practised, mainly in copyright and patents. But then the Bank needed my services. Sometimes I still miss the drama of the courtroom.”\n“But surely, the City must offer its own challenges?”\n“It does,” he conceded. “Generally, though, the atmosphere is more relaxed than in our courts. And you don’t have to work against the clock all the time. Still, the work at the Bar was exciting.”\nFor a few moments he remained lost in his thoughts. I, in turn, was watching him with interest. Arthur Smithies had, I sensed, been less reserved with me than he would have been with a fellow Englishman. He was a friendly and sincere man but, all the same, constrained by the conventions of his class and society. With an outsider like myself, though, the strict norms could be relaxed.\n“And look,” I heard him say, “I do believe you have a worthwhile project. So does Jack Roberts of Brownlows, from whom, I believe, you got some information. He mentioned your enquiry when we met in the Club. I’ll see what I can do. But it may take me a few weeks. I’ll see what documents are left in the archives of some friendly banks.”\n“That’s really good of you; thanks,” I told him, “but a number of banks wrote to tell me that their archives were no longer in existence.”\n“Very likely,” he responded; “but some of the partners and their families have private stacks of documents, kept in case somebody wants to compile a biography. I expect we’ll find some interesting documents there.”\nWe kept talking about other subjects for a while. Then Brian Davies entered the room. He had, obviously, been asked to join us for coffee with a view to escorting me back through the winding corridors to the main entrance. As I expressed my thanks, Arthur Smithies made a helpful suggestion: “I should be interested to know how your work progresses.”\n“Would you, perhaps, be prepared to see the drafts of my chapters?” I asked eagerly.\n“I shall be delighted; and I may draw your attention to points respecting our current banking practice.”\nMy trip into the remote past – to my Oxford days – was interrupted by the stewardess’ request that I fasten my seat belt and put the back of my seat in the upright position. Realising that I had missed the chief steward’s announcement, I hastened to comply.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-hidden-rooms/chapter-1/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"1-an-extraordinary-catalogue\"\u003e1.

Meeting Eve An adherence to the chronological order seemed a safe procedure. Accordingly, I went back to the origin.\nEve was an attractive woman in her mid-thirties. Initially, she was startled by our appearance but soon viewed the tiger with admiration. Theophil had shrunk him to the size of a Burmese cat. Having stroked him affectionately, she turned to me: “He is adorable. But who are you? What brings you here?”\n“My name is Peter: one of your descendants. I’ve come to give you a gift.”\n“This cute pussy cat?”\n“I’m not a pussy cat,” protested Tiger.\nEve gazed with amazement as Theophil metamorphosed Tiger back to his normal size. To my relief, she was not frightened. Instead, she lowered herself beside the predator and tickled him behind the ears.\n“So you are a real tiger. Fantastic! And you must meet my best friend: she is a tigress!” For a moment Tiger looked at Eve apprehensively. Then he turned tail and sped away.\n“Why did he flee, Peter? I thought we were getting on famously?”\n“He is allergic to lady tigers.”\n“Oh, one of those … ,” she cut herself short as Tiger reappeared.\n“What do you think of my speed?” he wanted to know.\n“Most impressive, honestly. I’m sure you’ll win a marathon. But you, Peter, what have you brought me?”\n“This,” I told her and punched her nose.\n“You hit me,” she screamed, when she found her voice. “You are a hooligan: not a gentleman.”\n2. Adam and Theophil Step In “What is going on here?” asked a broad shouldered, tall and good-looking man, who had just returned from hunting.\n“This nincompoop punched me in the nose, Adam,” complained Eve angrily.\nFor a few seconds, Adam took in the scene. He then rushed towards me. Dreading a skirmish, I stepped back. Tiger, in turn, arched his back and stood protectively by my side. Our fears, though, were misguided. Holding out his hand, Adam embraced me and congratulated warmly. I had carried out a design he had harboured for years. Still, he had not had the courage to go ahead.\n“What’s the matter with you, Adam? For years, I’ve cooked your meals, washed your clothes, kept our cave clean and bore you two sons and a daughter. And now you shake the hand of this fellow! Is that how you show your gratitude?”\nAdam stopped in his tracks. His expression, though, did not reflect guilt. He was, simply, out of his depth. I, too, was lost for words. How could I possibly explain to this striking woman my motivation for an act that appeared bizarre.\nThe situation was saved by the sudden appearance of Theophil. He looked sympathetically at Eve, bestowed a smile on Adam and then addressed me: “You better explain everything to Eve, Peter’le. She thinks you’re mad. You started by being nice to her. You introduced her to Tiger and then, for no apparent reason, you punched her nose.”\n“So he did; and I thought he was a gent,” wailed Eve. As she raised her arms in protest, her nose started to bleed. Instantly, Adam offered her a piece of his loincloth, I proffered my handkerchief and Tiger looked at her with alarm. Graciously, Theophil produced an alcohol swab and stopped the bleeding.\n“That’s better, Mr. Snake,” she told him. “But I still don’t see why he hit me. Was it because I partook of the forbidden fruit back there in Eden? You, Mr. Snake, persuaded me to go ahead. And, in any event, why was I not allowed to enjoy that lovely fruit? Do you now say that orders have to be obeyed blindly?”\n“Of course not, Eve. People who obey orders blindly are often hanged or sent to hell.”\n“So why did you assault me?” she turned to me. “Because I disobeyed that Old Fellow in Eden? Surely, He does not need your help! He can look after his own affairs.”\n“Oh, I still miss Eden,” interceded Adam. “I had a wonderful time there. Occasionally that Old Fellow – as you call him – asked me to find names for the animals of his creation. That required a bit of planning. Still, for most of the time I just loafed about. It was Utopia! And here I have to work my guts out! Many good fruits were available in Eden: mangoes, bananas and grapes. Why did you have to taste that apple?”\n“Because I fancied it!” Eve let her displeasure show.\n3. Theophil Elaborates; The Almighty Opines To nip the argument in the bud, I asked Theophil to show them scenes from Man’s long history: the bow and arrow, the thumbscrew, the pillory, the rawhide and many war instruments. He then displayed some of the Goya’s Horrors of the War. When he finished, Eve was aghast.\n“But surely, all this has got nothing to do with me?”\n“I am afraid it does. All of it was launched when you decided to take that fruit,” Theophil told her.\n“But how?”\n“You decided to exercise free choice. So, you disobeyed His orders. The rest followed when your descendents settled their own agendas. But don’t you fret. Your decision triggered off some beautiful things. Have a look.”\nThe screen now displayed the pyramids, the Acropolis, St. Sophia and the Taj Mahal. A series of beautiful paintings, sculptures and ceramics followed. An opera, exciting performances by philharmonic orchestras and some chamber music ensembles brought the show to its end.\n“My disobedience had far reaching effects,” observed Eve. “But I still don’t see why you hit me, Mr. Hooligan. Are you a passive follower of rules?”\n“Of course not,” I assured her. “I punched you because you never thought about the effects of your act. You just went ahead without thinking. The rest followed! Your act lost us paradise!”\n“Precisely,” summed up my lifelong friend. “Still, existence in Eden would have been less exciting than life on earth.”\n“Suppose you had foreseen all this, Eve, would you have gone ahead?” I addressed her with trepidation.\n“I would, Mr. Hooligan – even if I had foreseen your childish prank!”\n“But why?” I asked stunned.\n“Because I wanted Adam,” she told me frankly.\n“But you had me in Eden,” countered Adam.\n“You treated me like a doll or a sister. That was not what I wanted.”\n“You could have seduced … I mean, awakened … me in Eden!”\n“With that Old Fellow snooping around incessantly? I am a lady, not a slut!”\nA white cloud announced the arrival of He Himself. Far from displaying anger, He smiled at all of sadly but tolerantly.\n“So, it was inadequate planning,” He sighed. “How could we have known that the sexual drive was incompatible with obedience or even reason, Matey?”\n“We couldn’t, Friend,” agreed Theophil. “None of us has such an urge. Still, if you had not given mankind a sexual drive, the race would have perished. We’ve got to take the rough with the smooth.”\nTiger and I took our leave shortly after the two super-beings retreated to their own dimension. Before we left, Eve invited us to visit them again, provided I had no further inappropriate designs. I assured her I had none.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novels/nose-puncher/part-2/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"1-meeting-eve\"\u003e1.

Our panel had to determine his destination. Real sinners – nasty fellows like Joseph Stalin – would, of course, be sentenced to a spell in inferno. When their mandatory term was completed, they would be allowed to enter purgatory. When all their sins were purged, they would be entitled to a place in paradise.\nThe composition of the judicial panel varied from case to case. Difficult ones would be referred to a panel of three or even five. In Archimedes’ case such a Coram was not needed. The judges were to be Friend – the Good Lord – and I, Mephisto, the archangel and the Good Lord’s bosom pal.\nArchimedes faced our panel with self-assurance. To start with, Friend, who invariably has the first word, asked whether Archimedes had led a good life. Further, he wanted Archimedes to reveal his crimes. Archimedes protested. He had been, so he said, a fine citizen of Syracuse, had invented many devices and instrument needed to defend his hometown and, in addition, had always been faithful to his wife!\n“But surely, Archimedes, you exposed yourself when you jumped out of the bathtub stark naked and danced – with water still dripping all over you – throughout the streets of Syracuse chanting: ‘Eureka, Eureka’. That is importuning!” said Friend, seeking to sound severe.\n“It was a silly act. But you know, I was overcome by glee when I solved that cursed mathematical problem. I didn’t know what I was doing!”\n“That’s no excuse,” said Friend. “And that’s not all! True, the good burghers of Syracuse were amused by the new eccentricity of their honourable compatriot. They knew you had to be taken with a pinch of salt. But the wife of a Greek merchant, who was a newcomer, had a shock and fainted. And she miscarried. So, you killed her child!”\n“But surely, Archimedes, had no malicious intention,” I decided to intervene.\n“I know he didn’t,” affirmed Friend. “Still, a man of his intellectual calibre should have foreseen the dire consequences of dancing naked at high noon! Accordingly, he was culpably negligent!”\n“Come, come,” I rose to the defence. “Archimedes did not know what he was doing: he was a man possessed. How then could he foresee anything?”\n“Oh well,” conceded Friend. “Still, he is guilty of homicide.”\n“Guilty as charged,” confessed Archimedes. “But please tell me: was it really homicide? When does a foetus become a human being?”\n“Some religions believe a foetus is human as from the moment of conception. This is a strict view. But when you, Archimedes, paraded yourself, the lady was in her sixth month.”\nTo the dismay of both of us, Archimedes banged his head against the wall. Overcome by both remorse and shame, he burst into tears. He thought it was monstrous that a moment of pride and joy had such dismal consequences.\n“Now, now, Archimedes: there is no man on earth who does the good and never sins,” consoled the Good Lord, who – despite his stern front – was kindly.\n“So where shall we send him to? Surely, inferno is not on,” I opined.\n“Of course not,” said Friend. “But, alas, so is paradise. Homicide is a felony; and so is importuning!”\n“I agree,” I ventured. “But, surely, the spell in purgatory ought to be in a ward in which a man of genius can continue to go from strength to strength!”\n“Does this rule out the ward for bores?” meandered Friend.\n“What is a bore?” asked Archimedes humbly.\n“A bore is a fellow who keeps repeating the same message again and again until nobody wants to listen to him any longer. A fellow sentenced to the ward is elevated to heaven only if he serves a jubilee as president and then is knocked out by a democratic vote of all inmates!”\nIn answer to Archimedes’ further question, I explained that the current president has remained one, Plato. He was nearly knocked out by Aristotle and, much later, had a draw when Emanuel Kant entered the arena. To avoid a second vote, we set Kant another task. He was ordered to re-write the first sentence of the Critique of Pure Reason so as to make it comprehensible to plain mortals. He was still working on it. However, in due course one Karl Marx decided to stand for the presidency. The vote was to take place in due course. The odds were even!\n“But, surely, I’m not a bore. I never repeated myself,” asserted Archimedes.\n“You shouted ‘Eureka’ at least two hundred times,” observed Friend.\n“But that was an exclamation; not a message,” I stood up for my protégé.\n“True. But, then, how about the ‘Impossible Missions’ ward?” asked Friend.\n“And what is that?” queried Archimedes.\nArchimedes let his disgust show when I told him about the lot of Sisyphus. Having annoyed Poseidon, he was ordered to fill a bottomless barrel. Every drop of water that escaped would be counted against him.\n“But that’s a child’s game. All he had to do was to plug the bottom!”\n“But how about the water that would have run off whilst he was plugging the barrel?”\n“Surely, these drops were going to escape in any event!” asserted Archimedes.\nMy Friend – the Good Lord – nodded sagely. Archimedes, he explained, had to be given a hard task.\n“Flying the mammoth?” I asked.\n“Precisely,” agreed Friend enthusiastically.\nArchimedes looked with forebodings at the huge head and tusks emerging from the deep pool. Judging by the head, the apparition was immense. This, though, did not perturb Archimedes. He wanted to know what had induced us – a panel of fair-minded judges – to immerse the poor brute in a huge bucket.\n“He wanted to fly,” Friend told him.\n“What’s wrong with that? Man had risked his life in attempts to fly. Poor Dedalus’ wings of wax melted when he ventured too close to the sun.”\n“Flying is for birds. Mammoths are not meant to fly,” asserted the Good Lord.\n“Why not?” persisted Archimedes.\n“Because mammoths are too majestic. Their role is to walk sedately and with dignity. They are not meant to hover merrily in the sky. In my universe, every being has a role to play,” elaborated Friend.\n“But you gave all beings ‘free choice’, Friend. So why shouldn’t a mammoth choose to fly?” I asked innocently.\n“You have a point there, Matey!” responded Friend.\n“Well, Archimedes, do you think you can help the mammoth fly?” I ventured.\n“Where there is a will, there is a way!” replied Archimedes with pomp. He then added that to remove any doubt it would be best to see the entire mammoth – not just its head.\nObligingly, Friend unfastened the chains which tied the mammoth. He then drained the pool. For a while Archimedes viewed the mammoth. Impressed by its size, he walked around the gigantic beast, feeling its skin and muscles. When he completed his examination, he asked whether we were in purgatory or in inferno. The poor mammoth was freezing!\n“In inferno the environment is too hot: not too cold,” disputed Friend.\n“But what would the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals say about the mammoth’s condition?”\n“They may not be pleased. But surely, they have no say in purgatory. Still, cruelty is repugnant. And we have to think of the Press. Can you warm him up, Archimedes?” asked the Good Lord.\n“It will take a long time. He is huge!” replied Archimedes soberly.\nTo ease the atmosphere, I produced an immense massaging machine. When I finished, the mammoth regained his vigour and spirit. Looking at me gratefully, he bowed humbly and then trumpeted.\n“Well, Archimedes. Can you make him fly?” asked Friend benignly.\n“I can! But only with his cooperation. I must be able to converse with him.”\n“Mammothskrit is not an easy tongue! And you’ll have to raise your voice,” observed Friend.\n“Like when I yelled ‘Eureka’?”\n“Precisely. So, are you still game to try?”\n“I am!” affirmed the Man of Syracuse.\nNotwithstanding his misgivings, Friend endowed Archimedes with knowledge of ‘basic Mammothskrit’. I, in turn, gave Archimedes a loudspeaker and provided a Persian hovering-carpet. With its aid, Archimedes levitated himself to the Mammoth’s eye level.\n“Who are you, Respected Sir?” asked the mammoth.\n“I’m Archimedes. You must have heard my name, haven’t you?”\n“I’m afraid I haven’t, Respected Sir. You see, I was immersed in this pool for eons!”\n“How ghastly,” said Archimedes and then told the mammoth his own life story.\n“Does this means that you, Respected Sir, are a great inventor?” asked the mammoth shyly.\n“I am the greatest! And I’m told your dream is to fly! Well, I’ll make it come true!”\n“Will you? But I’m so big. Can you really do it?”\n“Of course. But I need your cooperation, Mr. Mammoth.”\n“I’ll be delighted to give you any assistance I can. But, please, don’t call me ‘Mr. Mammoth’. My friends call me Moti.”\n“And I’m Archie,” countered Archimedes warmly. “And I shall make you fly!”\n“Pride comes before fall,” warned Friend.\n“Eh?” said a startled Archimedes.\n“You say, Moti will fly! I’ll believe it when I see it.”\n“Let’s give him a chance and a hand,” I stepped in.\n“Oh, very well,” summed up Friend. “Archimedes, you have all the time in the world to accomplish your task!”\nBefore we departed, the mammoth expressed concern about Archimedes’ well being. He, himself, might step on him by error and, on top of it, there were nasty snakes and wild cats around. They would not dare to tackle a mammoth but Archimedes might become their prey. To forestall all problems, I erected a small hut on the mammoth’s back. It was to be Archimedes’ residence during his spell in purgatory.\nWhen I returned to the site after five thousand years, there was some evidence of progress. Two huge wings were attached to Moti’s ears. Still, notwithstanding all vigorous efforts to attain levitation speed, the mammoth remained earth bound.\n“Is there anything wrong with my calculations?” wailed Archimedes.\n“Please don’t worry, Archie. The construction of the wings was fun! I enjoyed every minute,” consoled Moti.\n“Let’s have a look at the calculations,” I volunteered.\nFor a few hours, I studied Archimedes’ equations. Initially, they appeared fool proof. Then, with disappointment, I discovered the error.\n“Archie, how did you calculate Moti’s weight?”\n“The body and trunk were easy. But I had to estimate the weight of the tail. My instruments are not adequate for an exact calculation.”\n“Well, let’s do it together!”\nArchimedes viewed the result with dismay. When he realised how grossly he had underestimated the weight of the tail, he burst into tears. Moti looked at him with concern. Gently he stroked Archimedes’ shoulder with his trunk.\n“Don’t worry Archie. We knew all along the first try might fail. We’ll have another go. And one day you’ll find the answer! You will fly me!”\n“I sure hope so. But to think of all the work I made you do!”\n“But I love doing things together with you. So don’t you feel sad.”\n“And, Archimedes, it was not in vain. When Moti rises, he’ll need to propel himself. The ears are just right. So don’t you fret,” I augmented.\nI returned after another millennia. To my relief the pair continued experimenting. Poor Moti was running as fast as he could. His winged ears were moving steadily and his tail was pointing down to the ground.\n“I don’t think we can make it this way. You see, Lord Pan, Moti cannot run fast enough to rise.”\n“Correct,” I told him. “If he runs any faster, he’ll have a heart attack. You’ll have to try another method.”\nArchimedes looked subdued and bewildered and, finally, asked: “But how?”\n“Give them the basics,” prompted Friend. “We want them to succeed.”\n“Moti, why can’t you rise? What holds you down,” I asked Socratically.\n“My weight, Lord Pan. I am too clumsy.”\n“Nonsense,” I reassured the still panting mammoth. “Archie, too, cannot rise: and he is much lighter than you!”\n“So please tell us the reason,” begged Archimedes.\n“Let’s have a go. Moti, do you think the earth is flat or round?”\n“Flat,” averred Moti.\n“But what do you see far away?”\n“I see the horizon touching the surface.”\n“But if the horizon was flat?”\n“It would never touch,” affirmed the mammoth.\n“And what would you see if you galloped to the place where the horizon touches the earth?”\n“The same thing,” conceded Moti after a short pause.\n“Wel’ is the earth flat or round?” I asked him patiently.\n“So it is also round …,” stammered Moti.\n“Precisely,” said Archimedes. “Lord Pan is a fine teacher. What you and I see, Moti, is an optical illusion!”\n“Quite so,” I affirmed. “Further, the earth turns on its axis and rotates around the sun. For the moment, accept these as axioms.”\n“But then, why can’t we move away from it?” asked Moti, still bewildered.\nTo explain the point, I produced a ball and placed small pieces of iron on its surface. As soon as I rotated the ball, the pieces fell off. I then inserted a powerful magnet in the centre of the ball. The pieces remained in place even when I rotated the ball at high speed and turned it on its axis.\n“What did you put into the ball?” asked Archimedes.\n“It’s a magnet. It is used in a compass. And in the 20th century, ladies loved to buy slogans and small paintings fixed onto magnets. They attached them to their fridges.”\n“Compasses were not known in Syracuse. They must be a new invention,” observed Archimedes.\n“Invented after your demise,” I affirmed. “Still, now you know what is involved.”\n“I do. But can a magnet catch everything?”\n“No, Archie. It pulls only some metallic objects. But the earth, and all heavenly objects, exercise a pull which affects everything which has a weight. We call the substance ‘mass’. The ‘pull’ is called gravity.”\n“Aristotle said something about it. But how can I learn more about all this?” asked Archimedes humbly.\n“I’ll give you the writings of a fellow called Newton. Also, you need to know more about the movement of heavenly object. Please start by reading Copernicus, Galileo and Keppler.”\n“Both of us will be delighted,” affirmed Archimedes and bowed respectfully.\n“Well done, Matey” approbated Friend’s gentle voice.\nWhen I returned after another five years, Archimedes had digested the information imparted to him. He concluded that, to fly the mammoth, he had to free him from the pull of gravity. The best way was to create a surface – a carpet or blanket – which could neutralise the pull. Moti would step on it, be alleviated and then proceed by manipulating his ear-wings.\n“The idea is sound. But how do you create the anti-gravity device?” I asked.\n“You gave me an anti-gravity carpet when we met Moti for the first time. I must use the same principle. But I am still in the dark. I don’t know how the device works and can’t understand the forces used. Can you possibly give me any reading materials?”\n“Some are very old; but most were written hundreds of years after your time. They are not easy to comprehend. But, still, have a go.”\nWhen I returned after four years, Archimedes showed me his device. He had tried a sort of a balloon and then a Zeppelin. But he found them inflexible and simplistic. The device he now displayed proudly was a replica of the very system used by Friend and me.\nManifesting doubts, Archimedes asked: “Will it work, Lord Pan?”\n“Let’s have a look at the engine and your equations.”\n“I don’t want to risk Moti’s safety. So, we better be absolutely certain,” averred Archimedes.\n“Spot on,” I confirmed at long last. “Is it OK with you, Moti?”\n“As long as Archie (and of course you, Lord Pan) are happy with it.”\nFriend and myself attended the launch. Protected by an anti-meteorite and radiation shield provided by myself, the pair flew high into the sky. Within a few seconds they rose much higher than any balloon or Zeppelin known to mankind.\nThey proceeded at a dignified speed, propelled by Moti’s enormous ear wings. Their voyage, accurately calculated by Archimedes, took them to the lower levels of the stratosphere. Eventually, they landed, victoriously, next to us.\n“What a wonderful performance,” said Friend with glee.\n“A victory of the human mind with a few nudges from … outside,” I endorsed.\nWhen the travellers recovered from their ride, Friend advised them they had served their terms in purgatory. Each of them was now entitled to his reward: a safe passage to paradise. Archimedes was destined for the human paradise and Moti for the paradise of mammoths.\n“Can’t we remain together?” asked Archimedes with trepidation.\n“I am afraid not,” I explained. “You see, the human heaven is out of bounds for mammoths and vice versa.”\n“Why? Life without Archie is unthinkable. I’d rather be immersed again in the freezing pool. Why can’t I go with him?” Moti let his chagrin show.\n“What will young children do when they see you?” asked Friend.\n“But I am not dangerous. I am a strict vegetarian,” protested Moti.\n“True. But they don’t know this,” I pointed out.\n“I understand. But is there no way to keep us together? I can’t imagine life without looking after and being taken care of by Moti. He is my only friend. Please help us,” beseeched Archimedes.\nDeeply moved, Friend explained that a soul had to take its reward. A refusal to enter paradise would be a contempt of court. Still, the best jurist in heaven was one Gabriel, who loved to construe the law. Being the master of fictions, he might find a way round the plain words of the law. We would consult him and return forthwith.\nGabriel was pleased to render an opinion. In his analysis, the law was unclear. A soul had to enter heaven when invited to do so. But no rule prescribed how long it had to stay put. It was an open-ended arrangement. The legislature did not anticipate that a soul might wish to leave paradise. In consequence, no provision was made.\nArmed with this iron clad opinion, Friend and I faced our charges. Before long, a simple bargain was struck. Their ward was to be sealed off from the rest of the purgatory. A door on its right opened to a narrow tunnel to heaven. Once a year, Archimedes had to walk through it and spend a day in paradise. His task was to mount a stage and, equipped with a loudspeaker, was to sing and dance Eureka. Once he completed his performance he would be free to return to their special ward. Moti would be allowed to watch the show from a special cloud to be provided by me. If, at any time, he felt his friend was threatened, he would summon my help.\nOn some other day, Moti was to proceed for a one-day spell in the heaven of mammoths. Floating alongside on his levitation carpet, Archimedes would be allowed to keep him company. He would, of course, remain invisible to the remaining inmates of the M heaven. At the end of the day, Moti would make his way back.\n“Any specific do’s or don’ts?” asked Archimedes.\n“Yes. You must wear a pair of Bermuda shorts under your tunic when you perform in paradise. Importuning is strictly forbidden in heaven!” I told him.\n“To hear is to obey,” countered a deeply touched Archimedes.\nFriend and I watched Archimedes’ first performance with glee. So did Moti who, unseen by others, hovered on his platform. At one point he was so moved that he rose on his hind legs and danced to the tune of the band.\n“Well, these two found their paradise in purgatory!” observed Friend as we made our way back to our heavenly residence.\n“But what is wrong with that?” I asked perplexed.\n“Purgatory is meant to be a place of banishment. And it is to be kept quite apart from both paradise and inferno,” explained Friend.\n“But, Friend, every rule is subject to exceptions,” I told him.\n“I suppose so. But, you know, I think that, quite apart from these two, another ‘being’ found his happiness in this place.”\n“You have a point there,” I conceded.\nThe Trip to Aldebaran Friend – the Good Lord – looked as dismayed as myself, Mephisto. For centuries we went to watch the annual performances of Archimedes, the Man of Syracuse, and Moti, the mammoth, who – as told in the preceding story – dwelt in a special ward Friend created for them. Technically, it was located in purgatory; but out of bounds for anyone except the pair.\nOnce a year Archie was required to spend a day in the human paradise. His task was to sing ‘Eureka, Eureka’ and tell his audience all about recent journeys into space undertaken by Moti and himself. Dancing on an invisible platform, Moti was expected to trumpet, to applaud and to get engulfed in his pal’s performance.\nFor centuries, Archie’s performance was watched eagerly by the inmates of paradise. In recent years, though, their enthusiasm had diminished and their applause was half hearted. It did not take Friend and me long to discern the cause. Although Archie and Moti had visited many stellar objects close to earth, most of their trips were repetitions of their earliest success. Their accounts had become monotonous.\n“The only solution, Matey, is to give them some new tasks,” said Friend.\n“But we can’t let them fly too far away. It would be dangerous, Friend. I hate to think of what might happen if they ventured out of our planetary system. The universe continues to expand at a rate we haven’t fully worked out. Would they find their way back?”\nFor a while, we walked silently. Both of us had become increasingly fond of our protégés. Their happiness mattered. True, they may not have discerned the setting of their tide. Sooner or later, though, they were bound to note it. Each would hide his negative outlook from the other. Yet, in due course, each would feel the need to unburden himself.\n“Let us get to the bottom of things, Matey. I still wonder why Moti wanted to fly. Mammoths look down on other beings. So, we can be certain Moti did not wish to emulate the birds.”\n“His dream to fly was an aberration, Friend. No mammoth had such a dream before him. Most of them just want to walk about majestically and mate.”\n“Like many humans, Matey! Still, mammoths are not climbers.”\n“Why not pay them a visit? Moti will be glad to enlighten us.”\n“Go ahead, Matey. I’ll come over when needed.”\nArchie and Moti were delighted to see me. Archie bowed deeply. Moti rose on his hind legs and trumpeted. The cause of their elation was clear. Usually, Friend and I paid them a visit once or twice a year. An unscheduled visit so soon after their annual performance was a compliment.\nI started the proceedings by asking Moti what had induced him, originally, to dream of flying. I knew he had no wish to imitate a bird. What then had led to his daydreaming?\n“I wanted to fly to a beautiful star.”\n“Just one star?”\n“Yes, Lord Pan,” replied Moti humbly. Viewing the night sky screen, he searched for a short while. Then, triumphantly, he pointed out Aldebaran.\n“Why?” I wanted to know.\n“Because it is such a bright and colourful star, Lord Pan. You see I wanted to grab it and balance it on my trunk. Like I do with the rock Archie carved out for me.”\nLooking at me gleefully, he used his trunk to raise a huge ball-shaped piece of marble, lifted it high up, and balanced it. His act was as graceful as a juggler’s. Archie and I watched him with admiration.\n“How big is Aldebaran, Moti?” I asked when he finished his performance.\n“Oh, I know it is far away. It’s not just a red dot. Is it as big as Archie’s rock?”\n“Let’s carry out a little experiment, Moti’le. Archie will walk away from you. I’ll help you watch Archie as he moves into the distance. And don’t you worry. He’ll soon be back.”\nMoti watched anxiously as Archie moved away from us. Initially, Moti did not react when his pal shrunk. He had expected this. Still, he looked around him anxiously as Archie’s image disappeared altogether.\n“Where is he? I hope nothing happened to him.”\n“Have a look,” I said, placing telescopic lenses over Moti’s eyes.\n“I see him now. But you know, Lord Pan, he is growing bigger and bigger!”\n“He is moving back to us. Please keep watching.”\nMoti let his dismay show as his pal turned into a giant. Then, as I removed the lenses, a happy expression descended over Moti’s face: “Now he is again our Archie.”\n“Precisely. But you know, Moti, his size and appearance remained unchanged throughout. He was and has remained our Archie.”\n“So, he became smaller when he moved away. But what made him look so big? Was it the glass you put over my eyes, Lord Pan?”\n“Precisely, Moti’le. Your eyesight became very strong.”\n“This means that what we see depends also on the power of our eyes,” concluded Moti.\n“Precisely.”\nArchie was about to explain but took the hint conveyed by my suppressing hand signal. Moti, who put his trunk protectively around his pal, looked at me inquisitively. After a slight hesitation, I produced a powerful electronic telescope, put a dark protective shield on top of it, and asked Moti to have a better peek at his bright star.\n“How awful. It looks like a boiling red soup,” exclaimed Moti.\nUnexpectedly Archie had his say: “Doesn’t it ever? It reminds me of an outbreak of a volcano. If Moti and I touched its surface, we’d be incinerated.”\n“You would. Even after your transition you have some mass and physical existence. And, surely, Archie: you could never turn back.”\n“Because of the ‘pull’ – the force you call gravity, Lord Pan?”\n“Precisely.”\n“How about Lord Jupiter and yourself? Can it pull you?”\n“Hard to say, Archie. We have even less mass than Moti and you. Aldebaran may not exercise a pull on us. But we’re not sure about other objects: like black holes.”\n“So even you can’t be certain, Lord Pan,” Archie spoke respectfully but, at the same time, with confidence.\n“No, Archie: I can’t. You see, when Friend created the world, it was smaller than today. The universe keeps expanding at a rate incalculable. And Friend does not wish to control it. He decreed free choice: even to the universe.”\nArchie and Moti digested the information. I kept watching them. I had realised that Archie used Moti’s intellect as a supportive tool: Moti had become his calculating machine. After a pause, Archie observed that, to assess Aldebaran’s size and gravity, we had to measure its distance from us.\n“I know how to do it. Archie taught me,” bragged Moti.\n“Come on; let us see,” I coaxed him.\n“I can’t handle the instrument, Lord Pan. Archie will take the measurements and I’ll do the calculations. I can’t use a calculator; but I have a Mammo-Abacus.”\nIt took the pair a while to come up with their results. Anxiously, Archie proclaimed that such a distance was unthinkable. They ought to have another go. Once again, they took their time but, in the end, came up with a similar result.\nAt my suggestion, they changed the basic unit of their complex calculations. After some fine tuning, Archie asserted that a beam of light would fall on our planet some 63 years after it left Aldebaran. This led our protégés to the conclusion that they would need at least 126 years for a ‘round trip’. As they were unable to travel at the speed of light the trip was bound to take an even longer time.\nArchie appreciated that any landing on the giant star was ruled out by its temperature and gravity. Still, even a trip to a vantage point – for instance, half the distance separating the two worlds – would take too long. Moti’s quest would have to remain a dream.\n“But, Archie, can’t we find a better route?” I asked.\n“The shortest distance between two dots on a two-dimensional surface is the straight line; and there can be only one such line. It is a basic axiom, Lord Pan.”\n“Can we find a way around it?”\nArchie’s expression became strained. He was uncertain and, just for once, bewildered. To my delight, Moti stepped in. He averred that he had never seen a two-dimensional object. Everything – even the thinnest sheet of paper – had length, width and thickness. The ‘two-dimensional surface’ was a theorem.\n“Accordingly, your world has more than two dimensions. Moti mentioned three. Is there any other?”\n“Archie tells me that ‘time’ is also a dimension,” stammered Moti.\n“It is. And you, Moti, are the smartest mammoth in the world,” exclaimed Friend, who had joined us with glee. His pleasure affected me. Both of us were beaming. Moti, in turn, looked at us reverently, basking in Friend’s commendation.\n“Well, Archie: we have to adapt our axiom. How many straight lines can there be between two dots on a four-dimensional surface?” I asked.\n“Archie told me some time ago: an infinite number,” interceded Moti.\n“And the shortest route depends on the mode of movement,” augmented Archie.\nShortly thereafter Friend and I departed. Aldebaran’s gravity and state ruled out a landing on its surface. Archie and Moti were to find the best vantage point for viewing and studying the red giant star. Friend and I would supply the travelling apparatus.\nArchie’s annual performances in paradise regained their lustre. Instead of telling his audience about new short trips undertaken by Moti and himself, he sang about the discovery of a new route to Aldebaran. Quite a few former sinners, who had entered heaven after completing their respective spells in hell and purgatory, proffered their advice. Kepler, for instance, suggested Archie draw a diagram comparing Aldebaran with the sun. Einstein, who had been sent to purgatory’s ward for Propaganda Mongers, insisted the vantage point ought to be at a spot in the universe that did not intersect with planetary objects. Fresh from the district of Short-Fused Individuals, Hubble thought Archie ought to calculate the distances from the sun to the earth and to Aldebaran respectively.\nGenerally, the discussions produced heat and, hopefully, some light. There were also some subdued moments. Ticho Brahe, for instance, kept muttering that it was all in the hands of the Good Lord. When told that He was behind the project, Ticho sighed and repeated himself. Keen not to offend him, Archie said: “Oh, very well.”\nOne day Moti and Archie invited me for afternoon coffee. As a prelude, they produce their results. One diagram showed that, when compared to Aldebaran, the sun was a mere dot. Light, Archie added, would take some 4.5 minutes to travel form the sun to earth. All in all, their calculations agreed with views expressed by astronomers of the 20th and 21st centuries. They also pinpointed a vantage point for our observations. Only one problem remained unsolved. The vantage point was even further away from us than the red star. Reaching it appeared impossible.\n“True: if you travel by a conventional three-dimensional propellant,” I pointed out.\n“But is there any other way? I have sampled the infinite straight lines between the vantage-point and us. The distance is vast. How can we traverse it? I am unable to come up with an answer, Lord Pan. I am out of my depth,” confessed a much-humbled Archie.\n“We’ll get you to the vantage point within a few minutes,” I promised.\n“But how?”\n“We’ll start by dematerialising you to the next possible point,” I explained.\n“Is the process safe?” asked Archie anxiously, stroking Moti’s trunk.\n“Friend and I have used it for eons! Have a good look.”\nAs Moti and Archie looked around them, they exclaimed with delight. A huge Aldebaran took up most of our night sky. At one point, far away, a smaller object was rotating.\n“How magnificent,” exclaimed Archie.\n“Beautiful,” echoed Moti.\nBefore long, they went on their own multi-dimensional flight, keeping at a safe distance from the glowing and elegant object of their observation.\n“Are we the first to see it like this?” asked Archie when they were back with us.\n“Except Friend and me. You see, humanity has theorised about space flight for generations but, alas, without glowing results. Still, one day humans, too, may learn to use our system. It will, though, take them an immensely long time.”\n“So, we are privileged,” observed Archie.\n“In a way; except that both of you have completed your spell on earth and in purgatory and so you are not ‘real’,” smiled Friend.\n“And other … spirits?” asked Moti.\n“We saw no need to humour or reward them. Paradise is good enough for them,” replied Friend.\n“But haven’t you yourself seen the entire universe, Lord Jupiter? Archie tells me you created it. It must be like an open book to you.”\n“Perhaps it was originally. But as Matey told you, the universe keeps expanding according to its own free will. Matey and I travel across it rarely and only when needed.”\nBack in their ward, Archie and Moti showed their gratitude and appreciation. Still, Archie was keen to know how we covered such an immense distance in a matter of second. Surely, we could not travel faster than light.\n“Of course not, Archie. Don’t you know what would happen to Moti and you if we travelled in space at the speed of light?”\n“Einstein claimed we would sort of shrink into ourselves.”\n“He’s right, Archie. So, you did not travel in space alone,” I ventured.\n“You might as tell them the basics, Matey” shrugged Friend.\nMoti and Archie listened pop eyed when I explained we had travelled simultaneously in space and time. Our part of the universe was four, rather than three, dimensional. We made use of this principle and propelled the four of us into space and into time. Science fiction writers talked about space warps and time travel for decades. Scientists remained far behind.\n“Did we see Aldebaran in its present state and composition, Lord Pan?” sasked Archie.\n“You didn’t. You saw it as it had looked millions of years ago. But its composition has not changed. A million years on the time scale of the universe is comparable to ten second on the human time scale.”\n“So, we really saw Aldebaran as it looks today,” said Moti.\n“Precisely,” I affirmed.\n“And I dreamed of balancing it on my trunk!”\n“Obviously, it’s a bit too big for that. But we managed to get you a small piece of Aldebaran rock. You’ll be able to juggle it when it has cooled off, Moti’le.”\nFriend and I watched the pair’s next performances with glee. A fellow called Max Planck, who had finished his term as President of the Obscurantist Ward, gave Archie a hard time. He claimed our achievement was incompatible with one limb of his quantum theory. Initially, Archie was the epitome of patience and tolerance. I was relieved when, in the end, he claimed that Max’s theory required reconsideration. Max’s protégé and bosom ‘pal’, Einstein, grinned with satisfaction.\n“Max, you once said: ‘New ideas are always opposed by old minds’.”\n“I said: ‘minds’, not mammoths and dematerialized fellows!”\n“Still,” Einstein mused, “I like their method. They moved in space and time – not faster than light but … sideways.”\n“Nonsense,” asserted Planck.\n“Perhaps your theory does need … a friendly update?” Observed Archie, who was unable to hold his peace any longer.\n“That’s the right spirit,” observed Einstein. “Science continues to advance: it never ends!”\nPlanck muttered something about ‘intolerable liberties’ and wandered off.\nAll in all, Friend and I were satisfied with the outcome. Archie and Moti regained their zest. As has been seen, their audience raised questions, unexpected points and counter arguments. Yet, the applause was wholehearted and warm. We, too, basked in it.\nThe Priest and the Tiger Tiger looked around him sadly. He was getting too old to hunt deer. Occasionally, he got a stray lamb or managed to catch a sleepy hare. Most of the time, though, he was hungry, except for the leftovers he got when younger tigers killed their prey.\nNow that Tig-La was gone, he was, in addition, lonely. Often, he missed her nagging and shrill voice and her sharp tongue. She had hurt him regularly; but his lonesomeness took an even heavier toll. He failed to see the object of his existence. He had become a shadow of his younger and effervescent self.\nHe was sad and depressed when, to his amazement, Priest came on stage. He was wearing a dark long cassock, a shining string of beads and a coloured head gear. His eyes were fixed on the page of a book he was holding in his right hand. He was so immersed in it that he stumbled into Tiger. Muttering excuses as he rose back onto his feet, he looked at Tiger apologetically.\n“I only hope I haven’t injured you. My eyesight is not what it used to be,” Priest explained lamely.\n“Don’t give a thought. Age ravages everyone of us,” said Tiger good naturedly.\n“How very true,” conceded Priest and lowered himself beside Tiger.\n“What is that strange object you hold in your hand?” Tiger let his curiosity show.\n“It’s the Holy Bible. And it tells you all about God …”\n“God? I haven’t met him. Who is he?”\n“He exists everywhere. And he is so great and mighty that we can’t understand him. Our role is to accept Him and to obey.”\n“And what does he order us to do?” asked Tiger.\n“He wants us to be good, obedient and worthy. You see, my young friend: this is our role. He gave it to us when he created us.”\n“Come off it. I’m no longer young; and I can’t understand why you dub me a ‘friend’. But me‘think you must be very great indeed.”\n“I am your friend because I hope to enlighten you. I hope you too will accept the Good Lord. And what makes you say I am great?”\n“You say He is so great that we can’t understand Him. But surely you can’t preach his word without having a full understanding of his nature. So, you must be greater than us, common folk; perhaps as great as Him!”\n“That’s blasphemy,” Priest let his irritation show.\n“What is blasphemy?”\n“Using the name of the Good Lord in vain.”\n“In that case, you are guilty of this very crime. How can you talk about the greatness of a being you can’t understand?”\n“You are very stubborn!”\n“No. I’m just a plain tiger, who believes his eyes, ears and other senses. In contrast, you are the epitome of stubbornness and parochialism.”\n“Anything else?” asked Priest in resignation.\n“And you are simple minded: you believe in something you can’t understand.”\n“Oh well, we’ll have to agree to disagree.”\n“Quite. But tell me please: does your Good Lord expect his creatures to follow the dictates of their nature? Surely, he doesn’t want a tiger to fly.”\n“True,” conceded Priest.\nFor a few seconds, Tiger stared at him. Priest’s wild gesticulations and unruly conduct had whetted Tiger’s appetite. All in all, the portly priest looked a tasty morsel. Without further ado, Tiger set on him. Discovering that the cassock had no taste, Tiger stripped it away and devoured his prey’s prostrate body. The flesh, alas, was imbued with wine. Tiger did not enjoy it. Still, he knew that beggars can’t be choosers.\nFar away, in our chosen dimension, Friend (the Good Lord) and I (Mephisto) had watched the scene with mounting interest. Friend smiled benignly when Tiger tore Priest’s arguments into shreds. Still, he looked sad when Tiger devoured Priest. Neither of us, though, felt an urge to intervene. Tiger had performed a natural function, seeking to satisfy his hunger.\n“Do you think Priest really believed in you, Friend?” I wanted to know.\n“Most people profess to do so but employ different guises. Still, each creed proclaims a hierarchy of men in charge of the faith. Many such officers are sophisticated hypocrites: they get as much as they can. Others are blind believers, brainwashed by their elders. Priest was such a blind believer. So, all in all, he deserves a place in paradise,” concluded Friend.\n“I agree, except that a spell in the Ward of Bores might clear his mind!”\n“Optimistic as ever, aren’t you, Matey? But honestly, what are we to do about Tiger? He is old, hungry and lonely. Shall we step in his aid?”\n“I’ll have a chat with him,” I volunteered.\nTiger blinked his eyes when I materialised in front of him. For just a moment he tensed, arched his back, but then relaxed. His weary eyes assumed a friendly, carefree expression.\n“Have we met before, Respected Sir?\n“We haven’t. I am Pan, known to my enemies, and there quite a few of them around, as Satan, Ashmadeus, Lucifer, Archfiend and the Snake. Friend, who also lives in another dimension, calls me Matey. Priest just told you a lot of rubbish about Him.”\n“Is your friend then the Good Lord, Lord Pan?”\n“He is indeed, except that many know him as Lord Jupiter. Like myself, he was dismayed when Priest misused his name to demand blind obedience. Friend and I believe in free choice. In His wisdom He gave it to the entire world when he created it. And I am convinced he chose the correct way.”\n“But wasn’t he dismayed when I gobbled up the priest?”\n“Both of us hate the sight of blood. But then, hunting is a tiger’s choice and lot. So how could either of us blame you, Tiger the Katz?”\n“I see, Lord Pan. But why do you call me ‘Cats’? I am a cat – a fierce cat – but I am an individual, with my own mind and, as you say, right of free choice. It is wrong to describe me in the plural – like ‘Cats’.”\nTiger spoke with conviction. Unexpectedly, I recalled the writings of Martin Luther. He, too, asserted an individual’s right to opt for his own brand of faith, albeit Christian. Had his spirit influenced the thinking of my new protégé?\n“Sorry for the misunderstanding, Tiger’le. I meant ‘K-a-t-z’ – not ‘C-a-t-s’!” I set out to clear the matter up.\n“What is ‘Katz’? I am unfamiliar with the word.”\n“No wonder! What a silly blunder on my part! In the language of the people who claim to be His chosen and holy nation, ‘Katz’ is the acronym of ‘Righteous Priest’. But, of course, you are unfamiliar with these people’s culture and language, Tiger’le.”\n“I take your point, Lord Pan. But surely, I just gobbled up one of His priests. How can either of you take it so lightly?”\n“A sect of learned priests, who composed the Mishna, the Breitas and the Talmud, would conclude that the fellow you gobbled up was an evil or false priest.”\n“On what basis, Lord Pan?”\n“If he were a Righteous Priest – a Katz – you wouldn’t have executed him. His fall establishes his guilt! A fellow called Job eulogised this platitude in lengthy discussions with three friends. And another fellow, called Abbayey, would say that yours was an Act of God.”\n“What a splendid conclusion,” beamed Tiger.\nFor a while we sat together in harmony. Tiger wondered why I had appeared to him. He sensed I was not seeking to harm him. After his initial fear of the unknown, he looked at me benevolently. All the same, he was startled when I explained that Friend and I had been watching him with growing dismay. He had ceased to enter the cave in which he had dwelt with Tig-La, guarded the entrance persistently and had stopped hunting. He lived on leftovers and sporadic kills. Was this a suitable lifestyle for a tiger?\n“Of course not. But you see, Lord Pan, Tig-La is no more. One morning, soon after she woke up, she toppled over and never rose again. I don’t wish to see her like that. So, I don’t enter the cave. But I don’t want hyenas or jackals to get in and harm her. I decided to be a sentinel. Also, you know: I can’t hunt any longer. My left front foot is very painful and, if I try to run fast, I start to gasp.”\n“I understand, Tiger’le. You pant because you are getting old. You are not as fit as you were years ago. But what happened to your foot?”\n“When I chased my little Tig-La, I skidded over a rock. I pretended it was nothing. But it kept smarting. Then, one day, I made Tig-La mad and, alas, she bit me in the very same spot. She apologised but, you know, the foot never healed.”\n“Friend can cure you, Tiger’le. He is the master of the universe and He cares for all his creatures (big and small) and looks after them. During the last three storms He erected an invisible canvass over you.”\n“But this was before I devoured Priest. Would He help me now?” wailed Tiger.\n“Of course I shall. I like to answer prayers,” said Friend, as he materialised in front of us.\n“But how about Priest?” persisted Tiger.\n“He wasn’t my priest. Not everyone who wears a uniform like a cassock or a Talith and Yarmulke is a Man of God. Many of these fancy-ball apparitions are hypocrites who use my name to make a living.”\n“So how can somebody like me know whether a preacher is genuine or false?”\n“Let your instincts guide you, Tiger’le. Unless they tell you a preacher is OK, assume he is a knave and a fool. The fellow you gobbled up deserved a medal for each attribute!”\nHaving settled this doctrinal issue, Friend examined Tiger’s smarting foot. When Tiger asked Him to beware of his claws, Friend demonstrated that they could not touch Him let alone scratch Him. Dwellers of other dimensions, like Him and me, had no genuine physical existence. Claws, bullets or arrows could not harm us in our natural state.\n“But just now Lord Pan stroked my mane,” pointed out Tiger.\n“He wanted you to feel his touch. Still, both of us can vanish altogether whenever we wish.”\nWhen Friend completed his methodical examination, he explained that one ligament was chronically inflamed. It would be best to replace it surgically. He assured Tiger that He could perform the surgery in a matter of seconds if Tiger remained absolutely still.\n“You must let us know if you feel any pain. And you’ve got to tell us so truthfully. Don’t try to be a hero.”\n“I always tell the truth,” affirmed Tiger. “Lies are useless. If you tell one, you’ve got to cover it up with another. So, you end up with a litany of irreconcilable lies.”\nFriend performed the operation in a few seconds. He then told Tiger that further treatment was required. To eliminate the panting, we had to replace a valve in Tiger’s heart. This time, a local anaesthesia was unavoidable. Tiger winced as the syringe penetrated his skin, but then kept still during the heart surgery. When told he would have to keep resting on his right side for two days, he reminded us he needed to eat and drink.\nIn response, I produced a boneless shoulder of veal. Tiger sniffed, ate it with delight and beamed at us. It smelt, he assured us, much better than Priest. Where did we get it?\n“It comes from the butcher’s shop of Reb Schlemiel. It is real ‘kosher’ meat,” I explained.\n“But how does Reb Schlemiel get it?”\n“He buys it in Smithfield’s market. He bleeds the meat before he sells it to Orthodox customers,” I explained.\n“And here is bowl of milk. If you can sip it together with the meat, you are a real Goy,” added Friend with relish.\n“Please forgive my curiosity, Dear God. What is a ‘goy’?”\n“The fundamentalists say: “Everyone except a Boibrick, with long sideburns, a beard, a black Kaftan and a Streymil.’ And, in their opinion, even such a Yid turns himself into a Goy when he puts on ordinary clothes and goes to the pub, the casino or … h’m … to the brothel,” I explained piously.\n“How remarkable. But surely, I have nothing in common with a Boibrick.”\n“Actually, you do. Neither of you eats pork.”\n“Wild boars are fierce: they are best left alone. And little pigs are filthy. I prefer gazelles and deer. With me, it is not a matter of faith,” explained Tiger.\nAt the end of the surgery, we moved the healing Tiger to his cave. He let his relief show, when I explained that Tig-La’s remains had been placed in a deep hole at the far end of their dwelling. He should reoccupy the remaining space. To comfort our new protégé, I produced a magnificent Persian rug.\n“Careful, Matey, that’s an anachronism,” warned Friend.\n“In the Torah, ‘early’ and ‘late’ do not exist. Time is irrelevant in religious analysis,” I assured him.\nFriend and I took turns seeing Tiger through. After two days, he was able to rise from his carpet. After another five days, we started to take him for daily walks. A week later, Friend made a gazelle cross our path. Tiger got ready to chase, but then relaxed and allowed her to speed away.\n“You are providing my daily bread, Dear God and Lord Pan. My stomach is full. So why should I chase the poor gazelle? I don’t kill for fun.”\n“Spoken like a real gentleman,” said Friend.\n“All the same, I felt the urge to attack,” confessed Tiger.\n“That’s natural: you are a hunter,” I interjected.\n“But he has learned to control his instincts. He is semi-human,” opined Friend.\nJust before we were ready to take our leave, Tiger raised the ultimate question. He knew our help would postpone the day on which he would cease to exist. But he realised that each creature was ‘finite’. He recalled how Tig-La had toppled over and ‘expired’. His query was plain. What happened to a creature after that ‘appointed day’?\nPatiently, Friend explained that each creature had to face a panel of judges. Depending on its mode of life, it could be sent directly to the paradise of these creatures, to a place called purgatory or, if it was a nasty being, to a horrid place called hell. Most tigers went straight to Tigersdream. A few had to spend a short spell in purgatory, mainly if they were found guilty of vanity or pride. No tiger had ever been sent to hell.\n“Where am I likely to go?” he persisted.\n“The panel will decide. But me’think you have been a good tiger,” opined Friend.\n“But isn’t Tig-La in Tigersdream?” asked Tiger shyly.\n“I believe she is,” I said indiscreetly.\n“Can’t you send me somewhere else? She was good wife; but isn’t one spell enough?”\n“You could join Matey. But, if you do, you become part and parcel of his ‘components’. You lose your individuality,” explained Friend.\n“I would not like this. Each being has its own destiny,” replied Tiger shyly, brushing gently against my robe.\n“In any event, Tiger’le: I accept only humans. They alone are sufficiently curious and stupid to pursue an endless search. You may not fit in,” I told him.\nAfter some consideration, Friend raised a third possibility. Hidden in a special ward off purgatory resided Archimedes (the Greek mathematician and physicist) and Moti, the mammoth.\n“How does this affect me?” asked Tiger.\n“Your task would be to induce Archie and Moti to invite you to join them.”\n“But would they accept me?”\n“Where there is a will, there is a way,” Friend assured him.\n“I agree,” I added laconically.\nFrom a Party to a Crowd Moti was taking his bath. As he immersed himself in the huge pond, Archie hovered around him on his levitation carpet. With a soft, wetted, cloth, he sponged his huge friend. Moti enjoyed the soft circular motion. Archie, in turn, was perspiring. Still, Friend, the Good Lord, and I, Mephisto, encouraged him to pursue the weekly procedure. It was his main exercise. It kept him lithe and fit.\nFor hundreds of years, I watched the pair living in their ward – which was out bounds to others. In a sense, theirs was an exclusive habitat. This very morning the two were to be put to a test. As Moti got ready to emerge from the pool, a previously invisible door opened itself. When Tiger entered through it, Moti tensed. His huge trunk encircled Archie and, fondly, he placed his friend on his enormous back. Then, raising his trunk threateningly, he faced the intruder.\n“Please, Respected Sir, I have not come as an enemy.”\n“But you are a fierce tiger. You come from a race that dared to challenge us. And who taught you to speak Mammothskrit?”\n“Lord Pan did. He also taught me Greek.”\n“But why did he send you here?” asked Archie.\nTo the sound of his friend’s composed voice, Moti relaxed. Still, he continued to eye Tiger intently. Seeking to reassure the mammoth, Tiger explained the background of his sentence. He had, actually, been a good tiger, hunting when his stomach was empty and never killing or chasing for fun. The Divine Panel was inclined to send him straight to Tigersdream. But when he realised that Tig-La, whom he had lost after many years of marriage, had already entered their paradise, he beseeched his Judges to send him elsewhere. Their final decision was to set him the task of inducing Archie and Moti to invite him to join them.\n“Were you so unhappy with Tig-La?” asked Moti in his direct manner.\n“Oh, I wouldn’t say that. All in all, she was OK, notwithstanding her sharp tongue and sharp teeth. Still, I felt that one spell was more than enough.”\n“You, too, Tiger’le! My Motia nagged like hell and then eloped with a younger mammoth. Initially, I gave chase. But then I decided it was good riddance of bad rubbish. So, when I caught up with them, I simply wished them the best of luck.”\n“Good on you, Moti’le. Why didn’t you tell me this before?” interjected Archie.\n“I was embarrassed. But how about your exploits with human ladies?”\n“The less said, the better. Still, here were are: Archie and Moti, the two confirmed loners with a common goal.”\n“Actually, what is your goal?” asked Tiger.\n“We want to find the answers to some questions. Still, our main object is to lead a peaceful and harmonious life.”\nTiger looked at them with unconcealed envy. The pair had achieved the impossible: an enjoyable and unpretentious existence. His wish to join them had crystallised. Still, his first meeting with our protégés was over. As pre-arranged with myself, he went back to the door through which he had gained admission. Archie and Moti smiled happily when he promised to visit them again as soon the Good Lord and Lord Pan told him to go ahead. Our protégés had come to regard Tiger a benevolent visitor.\nA few days later, Tiger went through the door when his new friends were applying their minds to an old problem. Was the invention of a tool, needed for the refinement of a known practice, original or just an application? For instance, was the invention of a brush, used for applying colours, an original invention? They realised that, prior to its introduction, painters used their fingers or a piece of cloth.\n“Why does the originality of this innovation matter?” queried Tiger.\n“Originality ought to be applauded,” explained Archie.\n“But surely, the brush is useful. If it was invented by a specific person, he did the Art of Painting a service. So did the unknown genius, who replaced tempera with oil colours. We ought to recognize their contributions regardless of their cause. The issue of originality is a red herring.”\n“I agree with Tiger’le. And, Archie’le, think of the anonymous mammoth who taught us how to make full use of our trunk.”\n“So, you prefer a utilitarian test to an intellectual one?” wailed Archie.\n“But surely, the object of tools is to improve our lives. Why does it matter whether the inventor was moved by intellectual, and hence original, curiosity or by a practical urge which led to the improvement of an existing tool?”\n“Coming to think of it, you are right,” conceded Archie.\n“I suspect tools affect our lives regardless of their origin,” augmented Tiger.\n“Please explain,” said Moti.\n“Take fire. It may have been the gift of the Gods or its use might have manifested\nitself when Man warmed himself up beside it. So did tigers and, perhaps, Mammoths …”\n“… we did,” interjected Moti.\n“Still, only Man taught himself to nurture fire and later on to ignite it. Fire has had a lasting effect on Man’s development. He taught himself cooking, firing ceramics and smelting.”\n“Well,” prompted Archie.\n“Surely, the origin of fire and of its cultivation is immaterial. Regardless of whether there was a scientific search, a chance discovery or a preordained step upward, the effect of fire on the life of Man is undeniable.\n“I take your point,” nodded Archie.\n“But then, why was Man alone able to utilise fire? Tigers and mammoths loved to warm themselves up beside it. Yet they were unable to cultivate it or use it. Why?” asked Moti.\nBy way of reply, Archie placed his right hand in front of him and asked Moti and Tiger to place their respective front feet beside it. He then explained that all three of them – the man, the mammoth and the tiger – had good minds. Moti, for instance, had a memory much better than Archie’s own and, once trained, could perform complex calculations faster than anyone else he had encountered. Tiger, he added, had a knack of raising unexpected issues: he was endowed with curiosity and imagination. But he was unable to make tools and machines.\n“But our limbs serve as tools. As you know, I need my front and back paws. Their coordinated movement enables me to build up speed. My teeth and claws are additional tools. And Moti has his legs, his fearsome trunk and his long tusks. Nobody except a pack of crazy tigers would dare to challenge him!”\n“I know,” conceded Archie. “Both of you use your natural tools to their utmost advantage. But your structure rules out the production of extra tools you may need. You, Tiger’le cannot produce a hunting tool like a lasso.”\n“How about me?” asked Moti.\n“You, Moti’le, are unbelievably strong. But you can’t construct a lever to enable you to lift even heavier weights. You may, possibly, think about it. But neither your hoofs nor your trunk will stand you in good stead when you want to produce a lever.”\n“What then makes you different? Is it the calibre of your brain?”\n“That had to be built up slowly and persistently. You have the same base as me. The difference is in my natural tool.”\nTo demonstrate his point, Archie moved his thumb and then showed them how it enabled him to grab objects, to handle them and, where necessary, to manufacture helpful tools, like a saw, a knife and a brush. The ‘autonomy of his thumb’ had an effect on the development of his mind and orientation.\n“So, your great leap forward was produced not just by your mind but also by a natural tool you were endowed with. But then, why do you have it and, further, why did we fail to develop it? My paw has five fingers. But they move together. I can’t move one in a direction other than the remaining four. Also, apes have hands and fingers similar to yours. But they, too, failed to discover fire. Why?”\n“I don’t know the answer, Tiger’le. Hopefully, Lord Pan will explain.”\nAll three watched me expectantly. In truth, though, I too was in the dark. Friend and I had meandered through the possible answers. We had, however, faced a stumbling block. The real question was whether development, or evolution, was a response to a need or took place largely by chance. In the latter case, the fittest were bound to survive. The inadaptable ones were bound to perish or be superseded. Man’s ability to apply his mind to the manufacturing of complex tools enabled him to leap forward.\nTo my surprise, Archie looked baffled. He had read the leading works on evolution, had made mathematical calculations of his own but, in the event, had come up with an ultimate query. What – he wanted to know – was the meaning of ‘evolution’? Was it inherent in a race as created or was it triggered by chance responses to changing circumstances? If evolution was ‘inherent’ it was part and parcel of the original creation. If it involved a response to random environmental changes, creation was still in progress. Like evolution, it was an infinite and progressive process. Apes, for instance, might in due course learn to cultivate fire. Some of them knew how to make rudimentary tools, like sharp wooden sticks used to extract worms from their hiding places.\n“Let’s put the question to Friend. As you know, he is the Creator.”\n“Indeed! He ought to know the answer,” augmented Tiger.\n“I wish I did,” Friend told them as he materialised beside me.\n“But Tiger’le is right: the Creator is bound to know the ‘nature’ of ‘creation’!” averred simple minded Moti.\n“He would indeed, provided ‘creation’ was planned in detail – had been fully mapped out – at its inception,” replied Friend.\n“Wasn’t it then?” asked Archie eagerly.\n“What do you think, Archie’le? Take your skill as a mathematician, as architect and as inventor. Were your achievements planned by Him at the beginning of ‘time’? Or take Einstein’s pungent theories and Da Vinci’s brilliant works of art. Were all these mapped out when He created the world?” I asked rhetorically.\n“You imply they weren’t. I understand. But then, what was the Good Lord’s (Jupiter’s) role?”\nBenignly, Friend explained that ‘creation’ was neither a simple word nor a transparent concept. True, somebody – in our universe He Himself – had to ‘create’. That meant that He started the process, which enabled a primordial mass – a Tohu and Boohoo – to form itself into our world.\nBiblical writers tell us he did so in seven days. The word ‘day’ though was relative. A ‘day’ could take a split second; or it could take an eon. The official account of ‘the creation’ had to be understood symbolically. It meant that by the end of the sixth ‘day’, He completed the initial tasks he had set himself. He then gave the entire world ‘free choice’. As anticipated, the ‘world’ opted for evolution. Some changes were linear, or progressive. Others were occasioned by chance. Friend Himself and his mate Mephisto kept watching with genuine curiosity.\nTo underscore his point, Friend asked our three protégés to tell him how their races procreated. Each pointed out that both the male and female of the species had a role to play. All of them looked with amazement at the amoeba shown to them by Friend. It took them a while to appreciate that it propagated by splitting into two. The species did not have a ‘male’ and a ‘female’.\n“What, then, led to the development of species multiplying by the joint efforts of a male and female?” asked Tiger.\n“I suspect the development was ‘inherent’ in the original structure. Lord Jupiter continued to ‘supervise’ it until he completed the ‘creation’ of humans,” mused Archie.\n“Precisely. Afterwards the species developed – evolution continued – by the vagaries of ‘free choice’. Matey and I continue to observe it but, except in rare cases, do not ‘intervene’.”\n“Have some species disappeared?” asked Moti.\n“Many have. Your own race, Moti, is a case in point. Due to climatic and environmental factors it was superseded by elephants. Earlier species – like terrestrial dinosaurs – are extinct!”\n“And the amoeba?” asked Archie.\n“Still exists. If it penetrated your system, you’d have serious stomach trouble. You see, the amoeba adapted itself to changing circumstances,” I stepped in.\n“Was its survival due to its ‘design’ or was it a matter of chance?” asked Tiger.\n“Matey and I have discussed the point ad infinitum. Shall we say that, perhaps, chance is inherent in the precept of ‘free choice’. You see, Tiger’le, frequently ‘chance’ determines ‘who’ or ‘what’ is the fittest.”\n“So whichever way we put it, you, Lord Jupiter, are both the creator and the originator of evolution,” summed up Moti, who had been listening intently.\n“I am. But you must remember: chance plays its role in evolution. It is an inherent component of the order of things.”\n“So, you made room for it,” concluded Moti.\nTo bring the discourse to its conclusion, I pointed out to our protégés that each species was perfect for its task. Tigers were superb hunters. Their feet, muscles, sense of smell and teeth were perfect tools. Mammoths were outstanding vegetarian mammals. Their enormous bulk, fearsome trunk and their tusks gave them adequate protection against predators. In addition, their trunk was used for feeding, for drinking and for trumpeting. Humanity, too, served its complex purpose. Its major tools were the adaptable brain and the flexible hand.\nPerfection, though, was relative. When circumstances changed, each species was at risk. For instance, what would become of tigers if the animals they hunted became extinct? What would happen to any one of the many species if the amenable climate they were used to turned into a new ice age? For a while, tigers may be protected by their warm fur. Humans might, if given enough time, come up with some invention. But many races, like Moti’s, would ‘expire’. Still, some particularly adaptable races or sections thereof may survive the calamity and even ‘initiate’ a new species, as did the mammoths who metamorphosed into elephants.\n“And the cataclysmic change, for instance of climate, may be produced by chance,” mused Tiger. “You, Lord Jupiter, have allowed ‘chance’ to affect and alter the order initially instituted by you.”\n“Unless you maintain that ‘chance’ was part and parcel of the initial order. In other words, you maintain that ‘change’ or ‘movement’ governs the world,” I interjected.\n“In the words of Heraclitus: pantha rhei,” said Archie.\n“That’s the issue. Matey and I keep pondering on it and try to dissect it. But you, Archie’le, beware of the amoeba. It isn’t any good for you!”\nFriend’s jest lightened the atmosphere. Up to that moment all present had been deep in thought. Friend’s exposé shed light on points which, up to then, had been clear just to Him and to me. I was pleased by his frank and enlightening revelations. Iyself, he treated our protégés as members of an inner circle. He knew that his disclosures were safe with them.\nShortly thereafter Tiger left the realm through his door. Friend and I also took our leave. I suspect that, like me, Friend needed a rest.\nTiger’s next visit took place three days later. Both Archie and Moti greeted him warmly. After a short exchange of pleasantries, Moti told Tiger they would be delighted if he joined them. Both were convinced he would fit into their pleasant way of life. Deeply moved, Tiger accepted. To seal the bargain, I moved his Kum carpet next to a rock Archie had modelled, by chisel and hammer, for Moti to balance.\nThe very same night, when Archie was soundly sleeping on his small hut on Moti’s back, I conducted an experiment. A plastic contraption, looking like a scorpion, moved slowly in the direction of Tiger, who was resting on his carpet. Tiger watched the intruder keenly but did not move. He rose only when the scorpion proceeded in Moti’s direction. Seeking to ensure Moti would not be disturbed, Tiger crept in the scorpion’s direction and, notwithstanding the contraption’s threatening tail, struck it with his front paw. He then dug a hole and buried the contraption’s remains in it and paw-toed back to his rug.\n“You sent us a real friend, Lord Pan,” whispered Moti.\n“Of course. Lord Jupiter and I want the three of you to be happier here than you could ever be in any other place.”\n“So we are. Archie and I are oddballs and I think so is Tiger’le. Our real happiness is when we are together, Lord Pan.”\n“I know. This ward off purgatory is your paradise.”\nIndeed, all three were content. Archie prided himself on having shaped a piece of rock into a suitable toy for his friend. Moti was delighted to balance it on his trunk. Tiger was, of course, unable to lift the rock. Further, he lacked the capacity to construct a lever or some other device for moving it. Still, he could rest beside it, could shield behind it and could meander on the perfection of its smooth surface.\nBack in our own dimension, Friend and I celebrated a job well done. Our special ward was now the domain of three outstanding occupants. Each of them had risen high above the ordinary standard of his own species. Archimedes was a scientific genius. Moti was a brilliant mammoth. Unlike his contemporaries, he had his own dreams and aspirations. Tiger was a philosopher and a searcher for truth. I knew that two were a party; three were a crowd. But then, what is wrong with a happy crowd, regardless of whether it settles in heaven or in purgatory?\nFree Choice Tiger’s gaze took me in as soon as I, Mephisto, materialised beside him. His luminous cats’ eyes stared at me benevolently. He knew I was fond of him and that I had great regard for his intuition. Quite often I talked to him when the two other dwellers of the heavenly purgatory were fast asleep.\n“You are deflated, Lord Pan. Why are you so sad today?”\n“I’ve been taking stock. It is possible that I too am guilty of the mess in which the world finds itself, my friend.”\nHe looked at me bewildered. Usually, I addressed him as ‘Tiger’ or, affectionately, as ‘Tiger’le’. Never had I elevated him to the position of a ‘friend’. A tiger’s face is not as reflective as a human’s. All the same, I sensed the satisfaction that descended on him.\n“I am honoured, Lord Pan. And, yes, I know the world is in a mess. Inmates of earth, heaven and hell have every reason to envy Archie, Moti and me. Ours is the good life in a ward of our own. It is off purgatory and far from inferno. I know it is not paradise. All the same, it is heavenly, Lord Pan.”\n“But then, you don’t demand or expect much. The three of you are as happy a crowd as you can find. You live in harmony and without fear or regrets.”\n“Lord Jupiter and you gave us the chance and made the arrangements. We are indebted to you. But, surely, the rest of the world ought to blame itself. You did not teach them warfare, torture methods or self destruction. They taught themselves. They are their own best pupils. A fellow called Stalin and his mate Hitler deserve a ‘distinction’. Genghis Khan deserves a ‘mention of honour’!”\n“Well spoken, my friend. But then, why is it that races other than humans do not inflict misery on their own kind? Man forms the best-known exceptions. Have you ever seen a tiger killing another for fun or in reliance on some silly doctrine.”\n“Of course not. A boy will ‘wrestle’ or ‘scare off’ another boy when they compete for a girl or argue how to share a ‘kill’. But it’s pretence. A lot of snarls but no bite.”\n“So why is man different, my friend. Even a peace-loving man like our Archie invented a set of mirrors to be used for setting the enemy’s fleet on fire!”\n“He told me; and he boasted because the experiment proved his originality and imagination. But then, he is a rum sort of chap. When the Romans sacked his town, he was so immersed in some circles and spheres that he ignored the soldier who threatened him. That fellow killed him!”\n“I like your trend of thought, Tiger’le. Still, would a tiger kill another tiger in that scenario.”\n“Of course not. It would be too silly for words. You might rub the other tiger’s nose in his circles – to teach him manners. But killing? What for?”\nHe spoke like a fine member of a closely knit race. United they stood. Divided they might fall. The very notion of exterminating their own kind was repulsive in their eyes. It could not serve the purpose of the clan. Humans were different. Some enjoyed the misery they inflicted on their own kind. It was part and parcel of their twisted natures.\n“I accept what you say about Man’s nature, Lord Pan. But why do you blame yourself? You insist that the Lord Jupiter, whom you call Friend or the Good Lord, is the creator. How could an error made by Him reflect on yourself or be brought home to you? Where is the cause?”\n“You have read the story of the ‘creation’, my friend. I believe Archie asked Moti and you to learn it by heart.”\n“We did. Both of us love to oblige our Archie.”\n“One detail is omitted in the accepted versions. When Friend created Eve from Adam’s rib, he invited me to partake in his effort. I too breathed on poor Eve, who became imbued with the spirit of both of us and transmitted it to her offspring.”\nTiger looked at me with sympathy. He understood what went through my mind. My usual line was to deny any responsibility for the sad state of the world. Man was destroying his own environment and his awareness of the process of self destruction, which he initiated, had not induced him to call for a halt. Religion, politics, science and a relentless pursuit of the demands of the moment prevailed over the restraint dictated by the survival instinct. What spurred Man on in the direction of unavoidable self-induced extinction?\n“I can’t answer your question, Lord Pan. It is too complex. I can think of many factors, each of which plays a role in the scenario. Still, I know this much: neither Lord Jupiter nor you yourself are to blame.”\n“Why ever not, Tiger’le?”\n“Lord Jupiter decided to give Man free choice and you, Lord Pan, stood by him.”\n“Doesn’t our guilt speak for itself, then?”\n“It does not. When you gave Man free choice you encouraged him to choose his own route. If he opted for self destruction, why is either of you blameworthy?”\n“Thanks, my friend. May the Good Lord – Friend to me and Lord Jupiter to Archie and Moti – bless you.”\n“Surely, he already has!”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novels/theophil/part-1/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"archimedes-and-the-mammoth\"\u003eArchimedes and the Mammoth\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArchimedes’ appointed hour arrived one bright morning in Syracuse (probably in 212 BCE).

Chapter 1 and 2 – the prologue – are complemented by the epilogue – Chapter 42 (verses 7-end). They are written in easy to comprehend prose, similar to that of Esther.1 They were, it is generally believed, written by the very hand which added captions or introductory statements to the ensuing text. By way of illustration take verse 1 and the first words of verse 2 of chapter 3, which read: “After this Iyyov [Job] opened his mouth and cursed his day. And [Job] spoke and said …”. The remaining part of verse 2 and the rest of the chapter are poetic and differ from the explanatory caption preceding them.\nThe prologue is followed by the exchanges between Job and his three friends: Elifaz the Temanite [Yemenite], Bildad the Shuhite and Zofar the Na’amatite. These encompass chapters 3 to 27. They are expressed in fine poetry. In essence, Job questions divine justice, maintaining his being innocent. His friends argue that God is just and that Job’s sufferings must be due to his having sinned. Job disputes their stand and protests his innocence in a final monologue (caps. 29 to 31).\nNext come the words of Elihu, a young outsider who is not referred to either in the prologue or in the epilogue. Elihu’s arguments cover chapters 32 to 37. Elihu’s speeches differ in style and vocabulary from the earlier chapters of Job. Notably, scraps of them were found in Qumran and they are also included in the Qumran Scroll, in the late Targum and in the LXX. They too will be discussed subsequently, including the issue as to whether they constitute an integral part of Job.\nThe penultimate part of the book – chapters 38 to 42:1-6 – are God’s Replies from the Whirlwind [Storm: סערה] and Job’s response. They assert God’s greatness (which has not been doubted by Job) and imply that His justice is unquestionable. All the same, they do not explain why in some instances wrongdoers or villains are not penalized. Job was included in the MT on the basis of these chapters. Regrettably, they raise difficult issues especially in respect of Job’s apparent acquiescence.\nBefore turning to the different parts of Job, it is important to stress that the poetry is outstanding. This is the case as regards the speeches of Job and his friends and the replies of God from the Whirlwind. Doubtless, some other books of the MT encompass fine poetry. Deuteronomy chapter 32 (Ha’azinu [האזינו]), Jeremiah 31, Psalms 104 and Isaiah 40 are amongst them. Job’s last monologue (caps 29 – 31) surpasses even these.\nSee, in particular, Esther: 2:5, introducing Mordekhay.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/essays/job-reassessment/part-2/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAt first glance, Job’s structure appears straightforward.

A Closer Look at the Facts of Seddon’s Case I knew jack was right. However, one point bothered me. In all trials, the judge’s decision is based on the facts proved to him. These, of course, might be at variance with what had really taken place. In some cases, the suppression of facts is intentional: the parties seek to cover up some sordid or illegal matter looming in the background.\nAll the same, I found it difficult to appreciate the point made by Dennis Gray about the Seddon case. To me it had appeared a run of the mill dispute between a customer and a bank. On their face, the facts were straightforward. An English importer – one Seddon – ordered a shipment of Grade A Jasmine Tea from an exporter trading in Hong Kong as Ng Pte Ltd. Seddon had had previous dealings with the same exporter and was satisfied with his record, standing and business integrity. All the same, Seddon arranged that the price of the tea be paid by means of a letter of credit. Why did he need an intermediary like a bank? Why didn’t he simply agree to pay the price in cash, probably remitting part of it in advance and the balance on delivery.\nOn the facts, Seddon procured a letter of credit from the Masterman Bank, a well established firm but, at the same time, not a lead bank. In the facility procured, the Masterman Bank undertook to pay Ng the agreed price of the goods against the tender of three documents: a bill of lading; an insurance policy; and Ng’s invoice. Ng tendered the stipulated documents to the Bank and obtained payment. The Bank, in turn, debited Seddon’s account.\nThe dispute started when the tea arrived in London. It turned out that instead of Grade A Yasmins Tea the shipped crates contained dust. Seddon contacted Ng forthwith only to discover that his ‘counterparty’ had been adjudicated a bankrupt. Seddon further discovered that the fraud had been committed by Ng’s suppliers in Beijing.\nAny proceedings against Ng or the ultimate supplier in China would have been pointless. Seddon’s only hope was to recover his loss from the Masterman Bank. The latter rejected his claim and denied liability. In the Bank’s opinion, Seddon’s instructions had been meticulously carried out: it had paid out against the tender of the stipulated documents.\nSeddon accepted that the documents received by the Bank were regular. But he alleged that the Bank should have advised him to insist that Ng tender an additional document, known as a certificate of quality and analysis, to be issued by an established firm of surveyors. If such a certificate had been required, the surveyor would have conducted spot checks of the goods. He would have detect the fraud.\nThe Masterman Bank disputed this argument. It claimed that, under prevailing practice, a bank did not owe a customer, like Seddon, any duty of care. Seddon was familiar with the trade and knew his counterparty. Why then was he seeking to blame the Bank?\nThe Judge accepted the Bank’s submissions and dismissed the case. In my eyes, the outcome was justified. Why should the Masterman Bank pay for Seddon’s simple mindedness?\n2. Jack’s and Dennis Gray’s Reactions Jack, the publican, was not impressed as I related the facts. He wondered whether the Judge had been familiarised with the background of the transaction. Would he have reached the same conclusion if he had smelt a rat? Had he been told the full details respecting Mr. X’s dealings with the officers of the Z Bank?\n“But surely, Jack, all this should have been established by our Mr. X. Why wouldn’t he or Jack testify about them?”\n“Suppose his lawyers advised against it?” He asked, his eyes narrowing.\n“Why should they do this?”\n“They might have had their reasons,” muttered Jack and, before I had the time to reply, offered me a shandy on the house.\nSome two weeks after my conversation with Jack, I called again on Dennis Gray. As anticipated, he agreed with my conclusions. On the face of it, the decision was unexceptional. Still, in his measured manner of speech, Gray emphasised again the oddity respecting the price of the goods. Further, he told me that a search conducted in Hong Kong revealed that Seddon was a substantial shareholder of Ng’s firm. This, too, was puzzling.\n“Surely, the Masterman Bank would not be familiar with the price of such goods. And how would they know that Seddon purchased goods from his alter ego?” I asked.\n“Perhaps they didn’t know of the connection between Seddon and Ng. We can’t be certain. But they should have known the price was too high!”\n“How?”\n“Well, we finance timber imports from Canada and Indonesia. Suppose a customer asked me to issue a letter of credit for an unduly high price. Don’t you think I would spot the point?”\n“What would you do?”\n“That would depend on the circumstances. But, Mr Berger, I would not be fooled. And I would smell a rat.”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/worthless-goods/part-2/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"1-a-closer-look-at-the-facts-of-seddons-case\"\u003e1.

Hendra\u0026rsquo;s Latest Misdeed When Norbert and Freddie arrived, the former was out of breath. Notwithstanding his energetic and imposing bulk, he found it difficult to keep up with Freddie’s youthful speed. In addition, Norbert was badly shaken. I suspected the two had had a row. My fears, though, were allayed when Freddie asked Norbert to raise the problem they had encountered. My heart sank when Freddie said, impulsively, “Curse that bastard Hendra; what a Schweinehund!”\n“You’d better tell me all about his latest misdeed. That fellow is the limit!”\n“He is. On this point, Freddie and I are in agreement,” muttered Norbert.\nI concurred. Hendra, whose real surname was one of those Indonesian tongue-twisting titular tags, was a man of about my own age. The nature of his business has remained unclear to me ever since we first met. I suspected he was a financial jack of all trades but, alas, never a master of his fortune. He kept hitting the jackpot only to squander his gains.\nLike many wealthy Indonesians, Hendra used Singapore as a base for his dealings. Over the years, the Bank lent him a substantial amount of money under the guise of shell companies and strawmen. All in all, Hendra and his nominees had some twenty accounts with the Bank. Each, except an account in his wife’s name, was heavily overdrawn.\nMost facilities had been granted before Norbert took over the Bank’s bad loans portfolio. He was flabbergasted when he familiarised himself with the file. All his attempts to reason with Hendra failed. So did a visit to Hendra’s hometown of Surabaya. Hendra was not only a glib talker but also an excellent host. Norbert added two kilos to his bulk; but the accounts remained in debt. On a few occasions Norbert was even talked into sanctioning further credit facilities. No attempt was made to consolidate the accounts.\nThe situation changed when Freddie took up his position. Some of the facilities had been granted without the formal approval of one of the members of the Bank’s credit committee. When this deficiency was brought to the new compliance officer’s attention, he went through the entire history of Hendra’s accounts.\nFreddie was outraged by the facts emerging from the file. Practically, a firm word with Norbert would have sufficed. Instead, Freddie referred the matter to the Bank’s head office in Germany.\nThe directors of the Bank reviewed the file. In the event, Norbert was instructed to pursue the matter “energetically and diligently” and to report back within three months. As always, he controlled his temper. Freddie’s name, though, had been entered in bold letters in Norbert’s bad books. Norbert did not like snitchers.\n2. A Set-Off Agreement Shortly after that incident, Norbert decided to refer the file to me. Having discussed the details with Freddie, I concluded that the first step was to consolidate the accounts. To do so, we required a document known as a “set-off letter” authorising the Bank to “combine”. In theory, it was a simple step. Practically, we faced a quagmire. As was to be expected, Hendra had the right to transact any business in respect of each account. Legally, though, the ownership was vested in different parties. We needed the consent of all of them.\nIn the event, I utilised a rough draft prepared by Freddie. Each party whose name appeared in the Bank’s ledger as co-owner or as joint holder of any account, was required to execute it.\nThe final document comprised two pages. One spelt out the set-off agreement and was executed by Norbert on behalf of the Bank. The second page was a schedule, which bore the signatures of all required parties. Attached to this were powers of attorney executed in Jakarta by all relevant parties. Hendra was given the authority to sign on behalf of each of them. Once executed, the agreement would be airtight.\nInitially, Hendra refused to execute the document. Two days later he caved in. The Bank remained the only financial institution prepared to deal with him; and Hendra required “further accommodation” of S$55,000. Norbert, who oversaw the file, refused to consider any further advance prior to the execution of the set-off letter. Reluctantly, Hendra agreed to sign on the dotted line.\nFreddie perused all the documents for regularity prior to the date of execution. After two hours of meticulous perusal Freddie confirmed that all was well.\nNorbert summoned Hendra so as to proceed with the formal execution. Hendra, though, had many questions to ask. As Norbert was not prepared to invite Freddie to attend, he asked me to come over to the Bank.\nIt took me a while to allay Hendra’s feelings of unease. His main concern, I sensed, was his fear of the Indonesian tax authorities. Further, he advised that his wife was not prepared to consolidate “her account” with his. Norbert yielded and, to avoid difficulties, sent various documents for re-typing. When they were properly typed out, it was time for a break.\nNorbert and I accepted Hendra’s invitation to have lunch with him in a nearby Indonesian restaurant. Seeing that spicy food did not agree with me, Hendra ordered various dishes suitable for my unsophisticated European palate. Following the repast, I had to return to my office. Hendra and Norbert walked back to the Bank.\n3. Subsequent Events During the next few months, Hendra asked for several extensions and for extra credit facilities. Notwithstanding Freddie’s misgiving, Norbert approved them. The total indebtedness in the consolidated account stood at S$650,000. Despite the constant sceptical memorandums from head office, Norbert refused to take action. Sooner or later Hendra was going to settle his debts voluntarily.\nFreddie disagreed. He feared that Hendra might declare bankruptcy. I shared his misgivings. Norbert, in contrast, remained confident. He was certain that ‘his client’ would not seek refuge in insolvency proceedings. Hendra’s main object was to keep going. Bankruptcy would cripple him for at least three years.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/matter-of-compliance/part-2/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"1-hendras-latest-misdeed\"\u003e1.

I further suggested that he get an opinion about the Belgian law in point. It turned out that, just as in Australia, a Belgian bank reference was not considered a business advice based on detailed research. This was particularly so if the reference was given without responsibility. Under Belgian law, such a disclaimer was effective. Another point emphasised in our Belgian legal opinion was that, as a matter of fact, the person who received the reference was entitled to bring an action to recover his losses only if he was able to establish that he had relied on the reference.\nTurning back to our pleadings, I was relieved to note that, technically, the Bank had denied Vollar\u0026rsquo;s reliance on the reference and had added that, in any event, Vollar was not entitled to treat it as the basis for the investment he was planning to make. Indeed, he had not disclosed the object of his enquiry in his request for information. Bruce Smith had no reason to surmise that, pending his reference, Vollar was proposing to inject a substantial amount in the business or assume the role of a partner. Further, Vollar was not a customer of our bank. Why, then, had he harked in his salvos on breaches of a duty allegedly owed to him?\nHaving digested the information, I attended a meeting of the Bank’s management. I was not surprised to find out that the case became of major importance. The good faith of one of the Bank’s branch managers was put in question. Vollar had pleaded fraudulent misrepresentation and deceit as well as a breach of a duty of care owed to him by the Bank. Effectively, the bank\u0026rsquo;s good name was at risk. The CEO, who had flown over from Sydney, put it succinctly: “The hell with money. What matters is our reputation. That fellow, Vollar, says we are a bunch of sharks. I want him to eat his words!!!

To my dismay, Robert had decided to proceed under both counts. He proposed to allege that the sales house had breached a duty imposed under the Sale of Goods Act. In other words, the auctioneers had given an incorrect description of the ‘goods’. As an alternative, Robert alleged that the statement respecting the mare’s condition, namely her being with fowl, constituted a negligent misrepresentation on the part of Douglas brown and that the sale house was liable together with him.\n“But Robert: you have not dealt with the exemption clause, which exonerates the sales house from any responsibility of the condition of the items listed in the catalogue!”\n“If the sales house denies that a statement had been made, I shall deal with the point in the reply.”\n“They are bound to deny any responsibility for any statement! So why not deal with the problem at the outset?!”\nOur latest exchange dealt with a complex point of procedure. If the person sued – the defendant – raised a point that required to be dealt with by the plaintiff, the latter was entitled to file a ‘reply’. Such tactics were bound to lead to delays and to amendments of the pleading (the statement of claim and the defence). Years earlier, my own pupil master taught me to meet hurdles at the outset. It was simple minded to expect your opponent to overlook them. Still, Robert was entitled to give preference to tactics he considered appropriate.\n“There is yet another difficulty, Robert. Suppose that the sales house simply claims that the item was as described in the catalogue. That is the best course available to them. So why not leave the antiquated Sale of Goods Act out. How is it going to support you?”\n“But if I do, the sales house can refer to it. So why not rely on it at the start?”\n“Because they may then also refer to the exemption clause. You are preparing the case for the ‘other party.”\n“I disagree!”\nI gave Robert a searching look. By now, I was convinced he had made a hasty commitment when the matter was discussed with him informally. Robert was impetuous and, occasionally, plain careless. Still, he had to protect himself.\nFor a few minutes I stared at the breath-taking view through the window of my office. Had any sailor been foolhardy enough to try to steer his way through the numerous cliffs without studying his maps carefully? But then, who was in a position to tell a skipper how to navigate his ship?\n“Well, it’s all up to you, Robert.” I told him at long last. “But consider another point. Is it possible that we are dealing with a mistake – a mistake on Jack Smith’s part such as his failing to understand a statement made by Douglas Brown?”\n“But an action based on a mistake would not help us. The contract would then be void. Jack Smith will have to return the horse and take his money back.”\n“Correct. But then, what does he want?”\n“He wants to have the bid reduced to $1,500 and keep the horse. He says he is prepared the risk involved in using the mare for breeding. But, if he had made a bid on that basis, he would have stopped at $1,500. He says his loss is about $1,500 and requires an award of damages of such an amount.”\n“So, he wants to have his ‘cake’ and … pay less for it than what he bid? H’m.”\n“He regards it a matter of principle!”\n“Best of luck to him then. But, Robert, have you covered your back?”\n“In my acceptance of the instructions, I told Jack Smith’s solicitors that my opinion was based of the facts as stated by the client. Surely, that is good enough!”\n“I would have been inclined to refer to the alleged the certificate. How on earth does Jack Smith explain that he did not ask to see it?”\n“He says he trusted the word of the sales house and their auctioneer (Douglas Brown). I told you so before.”\n“You did. Still, I am perplexed. To me $3000 is a lot of money.”\n“Jack Smith is a wealthy man and – you’ll be surprised to know – horse breeding is but one of his hobbies. He is an industrialist.”\n“Then he ought to know how to take care of himself. Try to get supportive evidence, Robert.”\n“The solicitors are doing their best.”\nRobert was referring to a well-known fact. Officially, New Zealand had rejected the English demarcation between barristers, who argue cases before the court on the instructions given to them in the brief, and solicitors, who deal with the client and have direct communications with him. If the matter had to go to court, the solicitors searched for right barrister and prepared the brief (or instructions) given to him. In New Zealand all lawyers had the right to appear before a court. They could act both as barristers and solicitors.\nI reality, though, some New Zealand lawyers retained the role of counsel, or, effectively, acted only as barristers. Robert was one of them. The evidence would have to be obtained by the solicitors. Robert was required to keep his distance from the client and the witnesses. He appeared before the court with ammunition provided by the solicitors. Naturally, in many cases he had to ask them for further evidence or better ammunition, such as documents. Still, by and large he had no direct communications with witnesses and their records.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/catalogue-description/part-2/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSome two months later, Robert consulted me on the draft of his statement of claim, that is, the document in which the party that brings the action – the plaintiff or claimant – narrates his case.

The old building, housing Jacob Keren’s law firm, looked as dilapidated as ever. So did the boulevard. The sparse shrubs along the centre lane had grown wild. They had not been pruned for months. Indeed, this ancient part of Tel Aviv remained as ugly and as untidy as it had been during my pupillage.\nThe door to the office of the Head of Bank Documentation was slightly ajar. Having knocked and entered, I looked Rachel over with amazement. In her days as a courtroom advocate, she had looked tidy and trim. Now no trace was left of her smart coiffure and her elegant posture. I was facing a woman past her youth. True, her confident manner and her captivating smile had remained unaltered. Somehow, though, she no longer looked like the woman I had worshipped.\n“Have I aged that much, Eli?” As always, Rachel used my Hebrew Name.\n“Rubbish. You are still the most beautiful woman in Tel Aviv, Rachel.”\n“You used to say: ‘in the world’, my pet.”\n“That goes without saying!”\n“Flatterer,” she replied bursting into laughter. But she looked pleased.\nFor a while we talked about the four years that had elapsed since she sent me packing. I had gleaned from her letters, that her third husband, Uzi, was a highly regarded orthopaedic surgeon. Rachel, who had met him shortly after I went to Oxford, was his second wife. She knew that his work was his priority. Often, she had to prepare an improvised meal, or just a snack, when he had to rush back to hospital, for instance, because a patient’s bleeding could not be stopped. Uzi, in turn, knew that Rachel was immersed in her job. He did not protest when she came home late at night or had to leave early in the morning. When she was in a rush, he often prepared her breakfast.\nAll in all, theirs was a loose arrangement based on understanding and affection. In Tel Aviv, each had an independent agenda. Still, twice or thrice a year they travelled. During these periods both were ‘away on leave’.\n“Was our own relationship suffocating, Rachel?”\n“We did live in one another’s pockets.”\n“Was that why you sent me away?”\n“One of the reasons. But look, we better turn to the case I want you to handle.”\nRachel’s narration of the facts was clear. Both of us knew Zvi Fischer well. We had used him as expert witness in some cases and had to confront him when he was called by an adversary. Fischer was glib, self-assured and quick on the uptake. On a number of occasions, when he appeared against us, Rachel beat him. On others he managed to find a way out.\nFischer’s reputation as architect and designer left much to be desired. He excelled when he planned standard designs, such as factories and apartment blocks. When it came to more innovative projects, his plans were usually rejected. He lacked both imagination and originality. At the same time, he was an excellent engineer and a meticulous surveyor.\nMy main concern was the man’s lack of integrity. It was known that, on at least two occasions, he gave expert evidence on industrial accidents without even visiting the site. Rumour had it that some of his plans were, likewise, based on photographs and measurements taken by others. You could never predict what he was up to.\nIn consequence, Fischer’s earnings remained modest. Usually, he was not the developer’s first choice. At the same time, he was a popular expert witness. Lawyers knew he was always ready to give battle.\nThe accident that took place in the instant case was banal. Fischer was in the course of a supervisory visit to a construction site of a factory he had designed. In the process he stepped on a wooden plank that was not part of the scaffolding. It gave way. Fortunately, one of the labourers arrested Fischer’s fall. He ended up with a twisted ankle and a broken foot. His suit against the developers was taken over by their insurance company. As no settlement was reached, the case was put down for trial.\n“What is so special about the case, Rachel? There is the fine legal point of the extent of a duty of care owed by a developer to a building surveyor. Surely, an experienced professional – like Fischer – ought to know how to handle himself on a scaffolding. Didn’t he know the plank was not part of the scaffolding as erected?”\n“He claims he didn’t!”\n“Surely, you are one of the best lawyers to make mincemeat out of him.”\n“You better have a look at Rotem’s instructions.”\nThe perplexing words were in the last paragraph of the letter instructing Jacob Keren’s firm to take charge of the case. Ruth Schwartz, the Head of Rotem’s Law Department, requested that Fischer be ‘handled gently’ when he gave his testimony. That ruled out a searching cross- examination à la Rachel. The case was to be fought on the legal issue.\n“Why does Ruth give us such a strange instruction? I know Rotem uses Fischer regularly as expert witness. I can understand they don’t wish to discredit him. So why don’t they settle amicably?”\n“Have a good look at the amount Fischer demands!”\n“Good God,” I exclaimed when I took in the figures. “Has Fischer gone berserk?”\n“I don’t know. But I have one important clue: he is Ruth’s current boyfriend!”\n“I thought the blighter was married?”\n“He is. But since when has this become an obstacle?” retorted Rachel with gusto.\nFor a while, I reflected. There was something fishy about the case. It deserved the attention of a lawyer subtler and more experienced than me.\n“Have you thought of using Boaz Tamir, Rachel? I know he has given up practice and has become a back bencher of a left-wing party. But I’m told he still appears from time to time.”\n“He does. A back bencher’s earnings are meagre. But, you see, Fischer stole a march on us there. He engaged Boaz right from the start.”\n“Shit,” I muttered.\n“You mean ‘shut’, my pet. The legal world uses clean language. Jacob Keren would have a fit if he overheard you. He uses foul language only at home.”\n“You have a point there: our beloved legal world has its own double standards.”\n“Not an original observation, Eli. But be this as it may, how about the case?”\n“It is an interesting case, Rachel. If Boaz is not available, why not use one of the firm’s own lawyers. I am sure you have engaged a few good ones.”\n“Any hawk would refuse to take the case. Ruth’s instruction would be bound to turn him off. And the less efficient old guard fellows would be unable to handle Fischer. They might turn us into a laughing stock. You are up to it. I am sure of it.”\n“I didn’t really want to take a case during such a short visit but, very well, I’ll take it. I need the money, Rachel. Further, I’d love to brandish swords with my old mate and adversary, Boaz. We had great times together: in moots, in debating societies and in court. How is he?”\n“I haven’t met him for years, Eli. He lives in Kibbutz Yokneam.”\n“I’m sure he’ll have a lot to tell me. I better go carefully through the documents. Has the case been set?”\n“It’s to be heard in ten days. I believe Ehud Morag is the trial judge.”\n“So, I better hurry.”\n“Quite so. And look, Eli, I can’t have lunch with you today. Ruth Schwartz booked me two weeks ago. Why don’t you prepare your notes? If you come over at about 11.30 on Friday, we’ll have a business lunch.”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/scaffolding/part-2/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eNext morning I walked over to Rothschild’s Boulevard.

For a few months we had been lovers. Recently, I left my parents’ house and went over to live with her. I feared that a decision to handle the case on my own rather than as a team member might disrupt our friendship. Then I saw that the door to her office was ajar.\nRachel skimmed rapidly through the file. She did not take notes but flagged some pages in depositions and highlighted passages she considered important. When she finished, she closed the file and asked: “So why do you want my views about this file?”\n“We are a good team. Your handling it as leader will be impressive!”\n“Could be too impressive. I would drag Simha’s nose through the mud. I despise the Simha Balanis of this world!”\n“How can you, Rachel? Don’t you think he’s been through enough as it is?”\n“I’m not talking about the accident: he’s a poor bugger; no doubt. But I know the type and I’d like to cut him to size!”\n“I don’t understand: honest!”\nFor a while Rachel’s eyes focused on a point above my shoulder. Her beautiful, usually serene face, lost its detached expression: she looked grim and withdrawn. It dawned on me that, despite our closeness, I knew little about her. All my probes into her past had been rebuffed. True, her surname suggested a Mid-European, Polish or Galician origin. Still, her features were not European.\nFor a while she hesitated. Then she told me her full story. Rachel’s mother was a Sephardic – a Middle Eastern Jewess. Rachel’s father, Jacob Zeitlin, deserted his Rivka shortly after Rachel had been born. Rivka had no option but to move with her baby daughter to Schechunat Ha’Tikva: the poorest neighbourhoods in Tel Aviv, populated mainly by migrants from countries such as Yemen, Morocco and Iraq. Regrettably, all Middle Eastern Jews were treated as inferiors by the European Jewish population, the Ashkenasies (or “Shiknasies”). The only jobs Rivka could find were laundry and house cleaning, mainly in wealthier districts of Tel Aviv. Jacob Zeitlin never showed his face and sent no money to support them.\n“It’s an ugly story. Still, what has this got to do with poor Simha Balani?”\n“There were many Simha Balanis in our neighbourhood, Eli.”\n“Don’t tell me one of them molested you!”\n“No, of course not, Eli. The Simha Balanis of this world do not molest little girls or do naughty things. To the contrary, if you carry a heavy bag, a Simha will step over to help. And if somebody bothers you, a Simha will shoo him away. Our Simha is a well behaved and responsible member of the community!”\n“But then, what’s wrong with him? What do you have against his type?”\n“Your Simha has a chip. He believes the world owes him! Sometimes he feels sorry for himself because he is not a ‘Schiknasi’: he says the European Jews have it all made for them. On other occasions, he feels ‘deprived’ because nobody offers him a home in a better part of town; or because nobody advised him to work hard at school and go to university; or because he had to support younger brothers and sisters. Whenever he can: he steals a march. He does as little as he can at work; shirks responsibility and goes through life sulking because nobody thinks much of him. Worse still: your Simha expects his baksheesh whenever he carries a heavy bag or does any other ‘good deed’ of the day!”\n“Street wise – true! But why do you despise him?”\n“The sanctimony and the shameful lack of dignity involved.”\nObviously, Rachel had succumbed to prejudice. Reasoning would be pointless. If she took the case, she would proceed on the basis that Simha was a rogue: a wolf in sheep’s clothing. Her cross-examination would be searching and might turn acrimonious.\n“So you see, Eli: putting me in charge of this case is dangerous. I’m sure to use any chance I get to clobber\tSimha!””\n“But where did he act wrongly in this case, Rachel?”\n“What was a man of his age doing such a job? You have gone through the file. Don’t tell me you overlooked facts staring in your face!”\nAs always, she made her point bluntly and hit the nail on its head. Solbon’s records, copied onto our file, told their tale. Simha had turned down a comfortable office job because he ‘liked the fresh air’. Further, soon after he was constituted foreman of the gang, he insisted on reverting to his previous, less glamorous but equally well-paid, position. He lacked – so he had said – the leadership required of a foreman. Simha Balani had decided to remain a member of the floor, provided the annual pay increases remained forthcoming. Solbon – a model employer – let him have his way.\n“He refused rank but wanted his yearly increments. What’s wrong with this?” I wanted to know.\n“But why did he refused to remain foreman?”\n“Why not accept his answer at face value?”\n“Because if that post brought extra money he would have clung to it like a baby to its mother’s breast. No, Eli! Your Simha didn’t want to be seen to be the ‘boss’. He’d rather bully the foreman into doing what Simha advises. That, Eli, is Simha Balani in a nutshell!”\n“If he is such an egotist, why did he risk his own neck to pull someone else out of danger, Rachel? Whatever the law says about such foolhardiness, it was a noble act!”\n“I’m sure he had a motive. Simha wouldn’t risk life and limb for a mere fellow worker! He had a reason; it will be interesting to find out. Still, I’m not the right person for this case.”\n“I’ll sure try to get to the bottom of things,” I promised.\n“So, you’ll take the case on your own?”\n“Well, yes. Solbon wants a friendly, out of court, settlement. But you’ll help me?”\n“Sure. And now you better apprise Keren of the arrangement. He’ll be much relieved! He’ll know we are OK: his star team hasn’t fallen apart! No need for good old Jacob to return to his old rat race in the courts. He can continue to leave the dirty work to us!”\n“An accurate but uncharitable summing up!” I muttered.\n“But realistic, my pet.

Both gazed at us with curiosity mingled with apprehension. Our first task was to make them feel at ease. To win a case, you must enjoy your client’s trust and confidence. As soon as Jacob Keren concluded the introductions, in which he alluded to us as his star team, Rachel set out to break the ice.\n“I gather you are back in School, Dahlia.”\n“I am,” Dahlia had a pleasant, resonant, voice. “And it’s good to be back.”\n“In this regard everything is back to normal,” observed Rachel.\n“Not exactly.”\n“How come?”\n“Before the accident many boys were nice to me. Now I’m more friendly with the girls. Before the accident some girls were sort of perhaps jealous because I was so popular. But now it is different. I think some boys are embarrassed because of my hands.”\n“You really think so?” asked Rachel.\n“Are these questions really necessary?” interceded Rivka Nissim.\n“I think we’ll let Miss Zeitlin raise the points now. They will be relevant when we proceed,” stepped in Jacob Keren. Rivka shrugged.\n“Oh, I don’t think they are unkind,” explained Dahlia. “But they used to tease me and – you know – try to show off. Now they don’t know how to behave. They don’t want to offend me. So, they keep away.”\n“And the girls?” persisted Rachel.\n“They’re no longer threatened by my being so popular. It makes them feel good to be kind. And I’m grateful: it’s good to have friends.”\nObviously, Dahlia had retained a positive even if realistic outlook on life. Most importantly: she had accepted her lot. Her responses convinced me she had a strong character and was not inclined to whine. If the matter ever proceeded to a hearing, her realism would stand her in good stead.\nFor a while, Rachel went on in the same vein. As she proceeded, Jacob Keren’s face brightened. He knew that, to win a complex case, it was essential to have a strong willed yet sensible client. When, in due course, Rachel was through, he signalled it was my turn. With some trepidation, I raised points that kept bothering me about the accident.\n“How do you think it happened, Dahlia? The switch was off?”\n“Oh, yes” she affirmed. “If it’s on, we can’t remove the protective guard!”\n“And if somebody switches the machine on when the guard has been removed?”\n“But it can’t be switched on. If the guard is off the switch is inoperative!”\n“So how do you think it happened, Dahlia?”\nJacob Keren’s raised hand blocked Rivka’s unuttered protest. She yielded but glared at me unhappily. Dahlia fidgeted and then, with some hesitation, replied: “I really don’t know – honestly.”\n“I don’t understand, Dahlia, how could the blade move when the machine was off?”\n“Perhaps because the main switch was on?” Dahlia spoke in undertone.\n“Shouldn’t it also have been switched off?”\n“The manual said so. And Mr. Wolf insisted we read it. But the big ceiling fans are also connected to the main switch. If you switch it off everybody complains the room was stuffy. So, we always left it on!”\n“Did Mr. Wolf know?”\n“Sometimes he also handled the machine and left the main switch on; everybody did!”\n“You see,” exploded Rivka.\n“Yes: but this is essential. We must know the facts,” Keren let his annoyance show.\n“One more question, Dahlia,” I sped on. “Did the blade ever move before when the machine was switched off?”\n“Not when I was working there!”\n“Why don’t you tell them it never happened,” interceded Rivka. “Mr. Wolf told us.”\n“No, Rivka,” insisted Jacob Keren. “Dahlia is doing fine. She tells us what she knows herself. What others told her is hearsay. She can’t testify to it. If necessary, we’ll ask Mr. Wolf. Any further questions, Eli?”\n“I’d like to know more about Mr. Wolf’s behaviour.”\n“He was really good to me,” confirmed Dahlia. “He came many times to see me in the hospital. He brought me chocolate; and he unwrapped it for me and was happy when I took it. And, you know, I don’t really like sweet things: but I wanted to please him. So, I ate it; and I don’t want you to do him any harm. He suffered enough!”\n“What do you mean?” asked Rachel\n“He lost his wife. And she used to run the office. I think this is why the policy lapsed. And he is a good man!”\nThe meeting came to an end shortly thereafter. Keren asked Rivka to contact Rachel or myself if she obtained any further information. We would contact her once we decided how to proceed.\nJacob Keren asked Racel and me to stay behind. He wanted to assess the information available to us and settle on a basic plan. Like us, he was impressed with Dahlia’s personality and bearings: she would be a good witness, and her demeanour was bound to command respect and invoke the Court’s sympathy. All the same, what argument was to be used to persuade Rotem to admit liability?\n“Is there room for an action against the manufacturers?” asked Rachel.\n“They’re a German firm,” advised Keren. “It may depend on German law. Let’s see if Wolf has any information.”\n“Actually, I’m having dinner with the Tamirs on Thursday. I’ll see if Wolf told anything to Boaz,” I volunteered.\n“Excellent,” grinned Keren. “You may also ask more about that main switch. After all, Wolf’s fight is with Rotem. It’s in his interest to form a common front with us. Well, see me next week. We must get cracking while the iron is hot. I only wish Rotem was represented by a more amenable fellow than Ben Zion Vered.”\n“At least he knows what’s he doing,” countered Rachel.\n“True. But he may have a grudge against Eli and Boaz; on account of that ‘ass’ debate!”\n“How do you know about it, Mr. Keren?”\nKeren chuckled. “I was there, and I enjoyed every minute of it – but I don’t think Ben Zion did. And you did rub his nose in it.”\n“Let’s hope he sees the bright side,” sighed Rachel.\n“Might as well hope for a miracle” concluded Keren.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ravages-of-a-guillotine/part-2/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eDahlia Nissim and her mother, Rivka, were seated in front of the spacious desk, which made Jacob Keren look bigger than life.

Although Hannah’s solid Hamburgese background differed in more than one way from my relaxed and light-hearted Viennese milieu, both of us were Yekkes. In a firm dominated by Russian Jews and Sabres this cultural affinity drew us together. Every so often, when we felt alienated by the rough mannerism and Chutzpah of our colleagues, we reverted to German, earning hostile glances from those present. In addition, Hannah and I shared a taste for books and for good films. Frequently, we lent German novels to one another and, occasionally, went together to the cinema. Another, even stranger, bond was that both of us suffered from Asthma. When either of us came down with an attack, the other lent a supportive shoulder.\nA romance, though, was out of the question. To start with, Hannah was my senior by some fourteen years, had been divorced by her husband after twelve years of an unhappy marriage and had a daughter aged ten. She had let it be known that another involvement was not on the cards unless she met a man, in her own age group, who was certain to be a dependable companion and a model stepfather. Obviously, I was not mister right. Another disincentive was Hannah’s down to earth and uncompromising approach to life. She was simply not of the material of which dreams are made. Her plain looks, gaunt figure and sharp tongue did the rest. In the event, we had developed a relationship of sister and brother. It bound us together without producing the undesirable side effects often associated with an affair.\nProfessionally, too, Hannah and I got on famously. Her stamina and perseverance, her skill as a cross-examiner, her ready grasp of facts and her sheer doggedness made her an effective courtroom advocate. I had a more analytical and academic approach to legal problems and an inborn knack for spotting weak points. So, in effect, we complemented each other’s skills. When pitted together, we formed a formidable team.\nMy recommendation that she take charge of the Omri Tal case was, therefore, dictated not only by subjective but also by objective considerations. She would nip Boaz Tamir’s attempt to steal a march in the bud, would know how to handle witnesses coached by him and, further, would thrive on piercing the veil of any demagogic or fancy argument Boaz chose to raise. My own role, I smiled inwardly, would be to undermine Boaz’s performance by placing traps on his course. This was the strategy I had used against him on previous occasions.\nAlthough the Omri Tal case appeared lacklustre, I expected Hannah to take charge happily. There was, after all, room for imaginative manoeuvrings and for an apt cross-examination. I was surprised by the scowl that marred her face when, two days after my conversation with Keren, she barged into my office and sat on the edge of my desk: “I thought you were my friend, Mr. Eliahu Peter Berger!”\n“Never must you question me!” I adapted the classic Wagnerian phrase.\n“Ha, Ha, Ha!” She retorted, letting her mouth drop. “But you better tell me – what made you ask Keren to assign this blasted Omri Tal case to me?”\n“You are the best person for it!”\n“Flattery won’t get you anywhere, Sir Galahad! That case is well within the brilliant horizon of Abraham Kadmon.”\n“Kadmon is aging fast: he’s losing touch. He may confound the issues!”\n“How about Ravid then?”\n“He’ll accept an unfavourable settlement and walk to his club early in the afternoon for a drink!”\n“So what? Rotem can afford to be generous, can’t they?”\n“They can! But, Hannah, I’d like to outmanoeuvre Boaz Tamir!”\n“Using poor me to settle a score with your pal Boaz? What has he done to you lately? Stolen your girl friend?”\n“No – Hannah – he is happily married to his Miri; and no – he hasn’t done anything to me. He’s a nice chap and, actually, we’re close friends! But it’ll do him good to be pegged down from his Olympian heights!”\n“So, you want to teach him a lesson out of friendship and brotherly concern. Well, well, well – I didn’t know you were such a caring person, my dear Eli. But, then, life is full of surprises.”\n“And for you, Hannah, the case will be a respite: needed, after your recent six weeks trial with Keren in the lead. Just for once, you can do with a walk-over matter.”\n“You have a point there.” Hannah loss of weight and dry cough affirmed that working on a major case with a martinet like Jacob Keren took its toll. I was concerned. “Are we on then?”\n“Do I have a choice? So shall we have our orientation conference over lunch?”\nLike most Israelis, Hannah and I relished Oriental cuisine. David Mizrachi, the Yemenite owner of the eatery near the courthouse, knew us well and led us to a table by the window.\nFor a while we gossiped about our colleagues and the office staff. When our orders arrived Hannah turned to our case. It soon transpired that, like myself, she had spotted the errors in Boaz’s calculation. We then turned to the first fundamental issue: would Omri Tal’s handicap interfere with his work in the long run.\n“My cousin lost a leg in the War of Independence,” said Hannah. “But he’s still one of the best jewellers in Tel Aviv. So why can’t our Omri sit on his backside when he works!?”\n“We better find out more about the work of dental technicians,” I voiced my consent.\n“I intend to,” said Hannah.\n“And how about his dancing?” I prompted.\n“This is the other main issue! We must accept that he won’t end up as the Israeli Valentino!”\n“If he ever had a chance. But, even if he did, he had shown no aspiration to turn himself into a professional dancer!”\n“True,” agreed Hannah. “But he does not claim loss of earning under this heading. We’re talking about loss of future enjoyment of life!”\n“Quite. But why can’t he find some other hobby? He’s young enough to pick one up!”\n“Ruth Schwartz’s secretary sent his photo over. Have a look.”\nThe young, well built and good-looking man, whose face was brightened by a warm, ingratiating, smile could not be readily associated with libraries or literary circles. His zest for life was bound to direct him to beaches and, perhaps, to soccer. Here was an out of doors man, proud of his prowess in physical activities.\n“Sooner or later this chap will be back on the dancing floor,” I said. “But then, Boaz doesn’t assert Omri will never dance again. All he says is that his client’s wings have been clipped.”\n“Quite. But Boaz will do his best to persuade our Omri to lay off. For a while, our Valentino will listen to him.”\n“So, we have to bide our time,” I mused. “Putting a P.I. [private investigator: detective] on his tail too early may be counter-productive. Omri may spot him.”\n“Precisely. I’ll give him six months. So, Eli – you know what do! And one more thing: I’ve not appeared against Boaz Tamir before. Do tell me a bit about him – is he a good courtroom lawyer?\n“He is indeed: excellent on his feet, keeps his cool in a crisis, likes to lay traps and is quick to spot one placed by the other party. And his timing is spot on. Still, he is not so bright when it comes to legal points: freaks out when things get complex.”\n“How comes you know him so well? He graduated two years before you?”\n“We met in the Debating Society. Also, we appeared together and against each other in Moots. And we are friends: don’t you make any mistake about this.”\n“You must have been a first-class team when you joined forces.”\n“We were. But he used to beat me when we crossed swords.”\n“So that’s why you’d love to give him a black eye. But tell me, does he specialise in running down cases?”\n“He doesn’t. Silver \u0026amp; Co.’s running down files are handled by Leah Sapir. Boaz specialises in industrial accidents and building disputes.”\n“That’s what I thought. So how comes he handles this file?”\n“Omri may have been referred by a common friend?”\n“No, Eli, no! Boaz would have passed the file on to Leah! I suspect Omri is one of his personal friends!”\n“But why does this matter?”\n“Boaz will fight hard for a friend. We all do. So we have to be prepared. Also, I want to know where these two met! They can’t be school mates: Boaz is some five years older than Omri! Were they brought together by some common interest or, perhaps, hobby?”\n“Boaz hates dancing and I can’t visualise Omri in a debating club. But – hold on – Boaz likes to play chess. He’s not too good but, even so, he’s a member of the Emanuel Lasker Club. He and his Miri love to watch tournaments!”\n“So, we better find out if our Valentino finds respite from his exertions on the dancing floor in chess! If he is a good player, we’ll tell him to regain his zest for life in chess. I’ll get the relevant information from an old friend.”\n“That would be excellent. So, we’re all set?”\n“We are. I better write to tell Boaz to direct all future correspondence and documents to us!”\n“Mind if I do this?”\n“Go ahead, Eli – but why?”\n“Because I shall use one of Kadmon’s standard letters. I’ll get his secretary to type it and, I am sure, she’ll dispatch it under ‘in reply please quote: `AK\\zb’!”\n“What’s the big idea?” Hannah let her surprise show.\n“Boaz will think it’s Kadmon’s file. He’ll draft his documents and plan his strategy accordingly!!!”\nTo my amazement, Hannah burst into peel of laughter, earning us the startled glances of patrons filling their stomachs on adjacent tables. “What’s so funny, Frau Hod?” I asked irked.\n“You: my dear Eli! When you first joined our esteemed firm, you sought to broaden our narrow horizons by talks about Rousseau’s social contract and about natural justice. And look at you now! Still, you might as well go ahead and give your pal Boaz a taste of his own medicine! Only don’t complain if he puts a laxative in your coffee when he gets a chance!”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/the-luck-of-valentino/part-2/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eMy choice of Hannah was partly explainable by the friendship I felt for her.  Although Hannah’s solid Hamburgese background differed in more than one way from my relaxed and light-hearted Viennese milieu, both of us were Yekkes. In a firm dominated by Russian Jews and Sabres this cultural affinity drew us together.  Every so often, when we felt alienated by the rough  mannerism  and Chutzpah  of  our colleagues, we reverted to German, earning hostile glances from those present.  In addition, Hannah and I shared a taste for books and for good films. Frequently, we lent German novels to one another and,  occasionally, went together to the cinema. Another, even stranger, bond  was that  both  of us suffered from Asthma. When either of  us  came down with an attack, the other lent a supportive shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Part 2: Teaming with Hannah"},{"content":"1. The Locum and his Provocation After his reunion with Peppi, Dad had to travel to Italy. On his return to the old Bavarian capital, Dad took the train to Peppi’s station. Upon disembarking, he saw a strange figure mounting the podium.\n“Where is Peppi Stölzl?” he asked the new incumbent.\n“I’m standing in for him this morning,” came the laconic reply.\n“I was hoping to see him here today.” Dad let his disappointment show.\n“He’ll be in a bit later; why not wait for him?”\nBy the end of this short exchange, Dad was glancing at the locum with mounting unease. Though not as broad shouldered as Peppi, the locum was even taller than the friendly giant; and he had no paunch. His face, though, did not match his young physique. His eyebrows sat at an irregular angle, his neatly trimmed goatee lent his countenance severity, and his sharp facial features, hollow cheeks and firm chin made him look fierce. Any remaining thoughts about trifling with the man were quelled by his probing and unflinching eyes. The impervious stare passed through Dad like a gust of icy wind.\nAs Dad moved down the platform, a metallic rattle announced the approach of a train. Dad watched as it pulled up along the platform and gradually came to a halt.\n“Let’s see how you like my performance, Tommy Berger,” Dad heard the locum say. Looking up in amazement, Dad saw the locum’s beckoning hand summoning the passengers to hurry out of the train. At the very same moment he shouted not the appropriate “Raus” but “Rein, Rein, Rein!”.\nInstantly the eager commuters, who had been shuffling about impatiently, leapt through the open doors of the wagons, colliding with the disembarking passengers. Unsurprisingly, angry scenes took place, especially as everyone thought he was in the right.\nBeing a peace-loving individual, Dad turned to ask Peppi’s locum to call a halt to the undignified proceedings. What he saw, though, made him gasp. The locum had grown in size. Indeed, he appeared taller than any mortal Dad had ever encountered. Their eyes met but, before Dad found his voice, a gust of wind and the clatter of wheels announced the approach of the next train. Startled by the sight of disorderly crowds on the platform, its driver failed to apply the brakes in time. With a sharp bang his locomotive smashed, albeit slowly, into the last wagon of the stationary train.\nPanic stricken, a group of longhaired men from Provence wearing light blazers, polo-necks and black trousers jumped out of the train. They had just arrived from France and were making their way to the stadium to support their team in a match with the Bavarian titleholders. Forming a phalanx behind their leader and brandishing sturdy and neatly folded umbrellas, carried on the pretext that it just might rain, the Frenchmen looked around them suspiciously. Their leader’s expression hardened as a group from Garmisch-Partenkirchen, adorned in braces, Lederhosen, boots and grey hats with green feathers emerged from another carriage. Yelling “Les Bosch, Les Bosch!” the French leader raised his umbrella and charged, with his group following closely behind him. The headman of the Bavarian group was no chicken! Ignoring his Pflicht [duty] to pacify foreign guests, he raised his mountaineering stick, shouted “Sieg Heil”, and gave battle.\nWithin a few moments, pandemonium raged on the crowded platform. As was to be expected, many locals joined their Bavarian brethren. So did some Austrians – who recalled affectionately the era of the Anschluß. All Frenchmen, Belgians, Dutchmen, a few dark gentlemen from Morocco and a number of Scotchmen threw themselves behind the Provençals.\nDesperate to find a way of stopping the violence, Dad turned again to the locum Station Master. What he saw made his blood freeze. The locum had now grown to twice the size of any man Dad had ever seen. Worse still, his right hand swayed as if he were conducting a philharmonic orchestra; and his sardonically smiling face was turned upwards, focusing on a spot well beyond Dad’s horizon.\nOvercoming his fright, Dad was about to address the eerie performer when a loud scream for help made him turn back to the platform, where two young louts had set on a middle-aged man. One punched him repeatedly whilst the other was trying to tear a briefcase out of his hand. Nobody on the platform heeded the besieged man’s clamours and, in no time, he was down on the ground with the two youths trampling mercilessly all over him.\n2. Shelter and Speculation Fearing for his own life, Dad rushed over to the locked door marked ‘Herren’. When his plea to be admitted met with no response, he looked at the nearby ‘Damen’. At first, his sense of decency dictated that he stay away; but another shriek of terror from a fresh victim spurred him into action. Preferring to risk prosecution for importuning to a spell in the city hospital with a broken neck, he hammered desperately on this second door, begging the good people inside not to forsake him. Initially, Sesame refused to budge. Then, suddenly, it swung open and Dad catapulted into the arms of a thick-set man with a friendly face and a fine moustache.\n“Quick, you help block door,” said his saviour in a heavy Russian accent. Obligingly, Dad (who was a practical thinker) removed the pole from a broomstick and, with the Russian’s help, forced it under the door handle. They then detached a panel from one of the cubicles. Having positioned one end of the panel against the door, they pressed the other end into a depression in the floor.\n“And now,” said the Russian, “we make windows fast; and we have Red Army bunker.” Remembering his manners, he added: “I Pavel Ivanovitch Popov, but friends call me Pasha.”\n“And I am Robert Berger; but everybody calls me Tommy,” said Dad, shaking Pasha’s outstretched hand.\nDad helped Pasha to shut the windows in the cubicles. Once the barricading operation was complete, Dad looked around him. He soon spotted a number of men of all colours and creeds who, like himself, had sought refuge in a singularly inappropriate place. Amongst them were an Orthodox priest and a Haseed.\n“But, Rebbi Mendel,” said the priest to the Haseed, “why is a man of your scholarship and devotion so concerned about a little eruption like this? Didn’t the Good Lord provide this … shelter … for our protection?”\n“It’s not us that I worry about,” sighed Rabbi Mendel. “I fear for the fate of the world, Father Constantin. I believe the War of Gog and Magog has begun; and it will be followed by the Last Day of Judgment.”\n“But, Rebbi Mendel,” said Father Constantin, “why do you fear the Last Day of Judgment? Don’t you want Jesus to come back to Earth?”\n“Well, Father Constantin,” said Rabbi Mendel shyly, “we \u0026hellip; as perhaps you know \u0026hellip; do not really believe in Jesus.”\n“True,” conceded the priest, but persisted unabashed: “But you, too, believe the Messiah will come.”\n“So, we do; and we pray for it,” agreed Mendel.\n“So why worry? Remember what will happen when He favours us.”\n“Oh, yes,” said Rabbi Mendel. “All nations will accept the Lord; and there will be peace all over the world; and we shall have the Brotherhood of Man; and Jerusalem will be rebuilt.”\n“So why the fear?”\n“But before this, Father Constantin, there will be the War of Gog and Magog: all nations will wage war. So, all people of the world will experience sufferings, humiliations and deprivations; and thousands will die.”\n“But, Rabbi Mendel,” pointed out Father Constantin soothingly, “not everybody will perish; and surely your devotion will stand you and your family in good stead. So don’t you worry. Instead, let us pray together that the Brotherhood of Man will come soon.”\nAt this point, Dad, who was a secular man, lost interest in the conversation. For a while he observed how Pasha and the other fugitives took turns to peep through the keyhole. Then, at Pasha’s invitation, Dad too had a go. Shocked by what he saw, he rushed to one of the cubicles and threw up.\n“You alright, Tommy?” asked Pasha, who had followed him and was repeatedly slapping him between the shoulders.\n“Yes, I’m fine,” said Dad when he recovered his breath. “But you saw what’s going on out there, Pasha. They’ve turned into savages!”\n“Yes, Tommy,” said Pasha sadly. “This is why in Kolkhoz [commune] we teach our children all men equal. And we must toil for Brotherhood of Man!”\nTheir conversation was interrupted by a fresh attempt by someone on the outside to gain access to the fortified latrine. Pasha, Dad and the other occupants threw their weight against the door. They were still holding this position when, at long last, they heard the unmistakable shriek of a police whistle and an imperious voice shouting commands through a megaphone. Taking another peep, Pasha pressed his handkerchief firmly into the keyhole and yelled anxiously:\n“Quick, quick: tear gas!”\nUsing their jackets and waistcoats to seal all the gaps around the window-frames and under the door, the escapees took their cue from Pasha, who breathed slowly and deliberately through his nostrils with his hand over his mouth. The uncontrolled coughing and anxious screams coming from the platform bore witness to what was going on outside.\nEventually the tumult ceased and the commands from the megaphone died down. After a while, Pasha retrieved his handkerchief and, gingerly, sniffed the air around him.\n“Is clean,” he concluded. “We better get ready.”\nThey did their best to conceal the damage done to the place. The panel, though, refused to slip back into its original position in the frame. “I think best is \u0026hellip; tactical retreat,” said Pasha resignedly. “If we wait around, perhaps Kulaks [capitalist authorities] ask us pay repair.”\nBack on the platform, Dad and Pasha looked around them. “It’s all over now; no more riot. But think, what a stupid waste!” observed Dad.\n“Was stupid; but not waste, Tommy! You see, this is important lesson to us!”\n“What about?”\n“Human nature. You give them excuse to quarrel and they fight – can be for no real reason.”\n“You may be right, Pasha,” nodded Dad.\n“Of course am right. My faith, Tommy, is Dictatorship of Proletariat; and my big dream is Revolution spread to whole world, Tommy!”\n“But, honestly, Pasha – can you really see this happening?”\n“Perhaps not our life; but one day must come. Marx, he said so; and Marx always right!”\n“Perhaps,” said Dad dubiously.\n“Is not ‘perhaps’; I tell you – one day old order go and new take over; and when come, we have Brotherhood of Man.”\n“But isn’t this what all religions assert?” Dad exclaimed.\n“Is so. Perhaps their first teacher also Communist? But real Brotherhood of Man not dream of religion. It come with Dictatorship of Proletariat, Tommy, because Proletariat believe all men equal before State!”\nHe was about to continue but was cut short as the large clock on the platform chimed the hour. “Is late, Tommy,” he said anxiously, “today we meet Mayor of Munich; must hurry. But I tell you, Tommy, you come see me in Kolkhoz. We have party and dance. You, Tommy, good man. You learn accept Revolution! So, see you again soon, Tavarish [Comrade] Tommy!”\n3. Metaphisical Discourse with Theophil For a while Dad reflected on the events of the last hour. They appeared incongruous: the mayhem on the platform, the strange assembly in the lavatory and – last but not least – postulations of the Brotherhood of Man by both temporal and religious zealots. He asked himself: “what did they mean”? Did Pasha, the rabid socialist, refer to the very ideal postulated by the Priest and the Rabbi? Dad was intrigued. For the moment, though, his immediate task was to find out what had happened to Peppi.\nHe was about to turn in the direction of the Station Master’s office when his glance fell on the podium. His feet turned to stone; he stood paralysed, staring at the strange locum who had grown to a colossal size. His uniform was stretched to its limit and, even as Dad watched, it metamorphosed into a loose black toga. At the very same moment the locum’s face became sharper and his eyes acquired a red tinge. His demeanour, though, became more relaxed and friendly and his smile was enhanced by an amused twinkle.\n“Is it really you, Respected Sir? They told us a lot about you in primary school and in the gymnasium,” said Dad with trepidation.\n“Yes, Tommy Berger, I am who you think I am! But fear not – I mean you no harm,” his voice was mild, even gentle.\n“What shall I call you: Mephisto, Lucifer or, perhaps, Archangel?”\n“I prefer to be called Theophil. It is the name by which I am known to my friends. My enemies can call me what they like: they do not count.”\n“But why are you here? Surely, the fate of humans is of no consequence to you!”\n“I like to watch people who interest or intrigue me; mainly out of curiosity.”\n“So, you are an observer – a searcher for truth,” said Dad warmly.\nTheophil nodded. “You have a keen intellect.”\n“Will you then permit me to ask you a question?”\n“Of course, Tommy! Why do you think I have revealed myself to you?”\n“Am I the only one who sees you?” Dad was perplexed and forgot his main query.\n“Quite so, Tommy. Well, look around you” said Theophil. To Dad’s surprise all on the platform were going about their business without casting even a glance at either of them. Occasionally, someone came so close as to brush against them but, invariably, did not make contact.\n“They could see the locum when I made them see me,” explained Theophil. “Presently, though, it is best for us to remain undisturbed and out of your dimension. Well, let’s hear your main question, Tommy.”\n“It concerns the Brotherhood of Man. I’ve just heard it postulated by two religious men, and, in addition, it is an objective of a politically inspired fellow. Obviously, the notion is supported by so many divergent groups. But can it ever materialise?”\n“To tackle the problem, let us define the issue. What is the Brotherhood of Man?”\n“To me it sounds like a dream,” said Dad, awed by the intensity that crept into the other’s voice.\n“I suspect you mean: ‘a state of perfection Man seeks to attain’ or an ideal,” suggested Theophil. Responding to Dad’s nod, he proceeded in the same profound tone: “The question then is whether Man has the attributes needed to achieve his object.”\n“For generations Man dreamt of flying. Those who tried were often ridiculed. All the same, some persisted. Eventually Mankind got there,” responded Dad. “It was a victory of the mind. This is what our Philosophy Teacher said.”\n“I agree with him. And the human mind is a powerful tool. But can the Brotherhood of Man be gained by an application of rational thought?”\n“I should say ‘no’. We must have the emotive drive to get there,” averred Dad.\n“Do you think mankind has this drive?”\n“Please tell me,” responded Dad humbly.\n“Let’s try together, then,” said Theophil, who had by then shrunk back to the size and shape of a tall man. “Tell me, my friend, what are the main characteristics of the fine citizens of Munich: and the Germans generally?”\n“They respect uniforms, obey orders, do their Pflicht [task] and defend their rights,” responded Dad readily.\n“And are these evil attributes?”\n“Not really,” reflected Dad. “People who respect uniforms and obey orders are law abiding citizens. And society thrives when its members do their duty.”\n“How about insistence on, and protection of, rights?” asked Theophil.\n“When applied within reason, it is a positive trait. People who don’t stand up for what is right are doormats.”\n“So why the riot?”\n“Is it because the people of Munich, the Germans, are extremists?” asked Dad.\n“But shouldn’t a fine attribute be taken as far as possible?”\n“That is what I find hard to understand. Even love, when taken to extremes, becomes oppressive!”\n“What then, Tommy, is our conclusion about the qualities you mentioned?”\n“They remain fine attributes only when exercised in moderation!”\n“And how about negative traits, such as lust and envy?” asked Theophil.\n“Passion, which is part and parcel of lust, is also a component of love. And the wish to do as well as your neighbours entails progress.”\nInitially Dad could not fit the pieces of the jigsaw together: they seemed random and shapeless. Then, with a flash of comprehension, he went on feverishly: “Are you telling me, Theophil, that good and evil are separated by a narrow – often invisible – line?”\n“Well, what do you think, Tommy Berger?”\n“It would explain,” Dad answered, “why faith, with its noble core, often leads to cruelty and tyranny. Innocent people have been tortured and massacred in the name of creed and ideology!”\n“Is the Brotherhood of Man then attainable, Tommy?”\n“Even if it were attainable, it would not last. Man is driven by emotions as much as by his mind; and emotions which are noble today can turn nasty tomorrow.”\n“Well put,” Theophil said approvingly. “Man has taught himself to fly. One day he may reach remote galaxies. He has unveiled many secrets of the universe. And he has split the atom. But he will never manage to introduce harmony and order into his environment and society: his emotive makeup is the obstacle. So the Brotherhood of Man will remain an ideal, a notion of perfection, unattainable by imperfect – yes, by flawed – beings.”\n“So this is what you set out to demonstrate this morning, Theophil. You have established that when passions are roused, reason is defeated. But then how many of us got your message? Even a bright spark like Pasha failed to catch on. And, to tell the truth, I should not have seen the light without your guidance.”\n“I know, Tommy; but when nudged, you saw it. And so did someone else!”\n“Who …?” started Dad, and came to an abrupt halt. “So that is why you looked upwards. You scored; and it pleased you.”\n“It did,” conceded Theophil. “In an intellectual discourse carried out from the Beginning, I have – once again – proved my point!”\n“As you did aeons ago when you encouraged Eve to taste the forbidden fruit of knowledge!”\n“I like your choice of words, Tommy. Eve was tempted by curiosity and desire. So I asked her: ‘why not go ahead – what is there to stop you?’ And she listened.”\n“And she went ahead. But then, couldn’t you direct us also to the Brotherhood of Man?”\n“I cannot guide you through a cul-de-sac: it is impassable.”\n“Could He remove the imperfections which block us?”\n“Remember what Peppi and you used to say on this subject in your school days?”\n“We thought,” Dad stammered, “that the flaws in our world showed He too was imperfect. So, perhaps, He too cannot guide us to the Brotherhood of Man, which denotes a state of perfection.”\n“But need you be perfect to create or generate perfection?” asked Theophil.\n“Can an artist create what isn’t in him? So, all in all, the Brotherhood of Man will remain unattainable,” Dad concluded sadly.\n“So it will,” agreed Theophil gently. Then, in an even more benign tone, he added: “You have pleased me, Tommy Berger; you have not shied away from the truth. You are entitled to a wish \u0026hellip; no, no, you needn’t ask me to protect Peppi against the consequences of my little prank. Theophil requires no scapegoat, and so Peppi shall come to no harm. Let’s have a concrete wish, Tommy.”\nUnsurprisingly, Dad took his time. Should he ask for a large fortune or for a passionate episode in his Indian Summer? But he discounted these: at his age, such benefits or adventures were best avoided. His one wish was to spend his remaining years comfortably and uneventfully in his old hometown.\n“I long to be back in Vienna, Theophil. I want to go back to my old Kaffee, order an Apfelstrudel and read the papers whilst I sip my coffee through heaps of whipped cream. I want to walk again in the Vienna Forest, go to the Volksoper [the popular opera], to the theatre and occasionally to a concert,” said Dad shamefacedly.\n“But will you be able to forget what had happened during the War?”\n“It was a period of madness,” said Dad with conviction. “Now that it is over, life can start afresh. Also, Theophil, my Viennese friends stood by us! They’ll welcome me back. But I cannot make a new start in a divided Vienna. Under the Russian yoke, it is not my old native land.”\n“You shall be back in your old Vienna in a matter of months. Your Dora and Peter’le will stay behind in Tel Aviv for the time being. Don’t let their misgivings stop you!”\n“Thanks, Theophil, I am grateful to you,” said Dad.\n“You’d be surprised how many of your compatriots have voiced the same wish in their prayers to Him. They too will go back because Vienna is and will always remain Vienna. And don’t look askance if you spot me next to you in the Volksoper. I, too, love Strauss and Léhar,” said Theophil.\nFor a few moments they gazed at one another – the metaphysical being and the man to whom he had chosen to reveal himself. Theophil could well understand Dad’s craving for peace and anonymity. The days when Dad hoped to climb Everest were long gone.\n“You’ll have a comfortable existence in your new Vienna,” promised Theophil.\n“I trust you.”\n“I am gratified. But now I must be on my way. And you, Tommy Berger, have an errand to run. Peppi is at a crossroads. His future depends on the outcome of the next few minutes. He may rise high or remain an obscure drifter. You have to assist him because I must not intervene.”\n“Will I see you again, Theophil?” asked Dad.\n“I am afraid not, Tommy Berger. I reveal myself to a human more than once only if we strike a special bargain. In your case, a pact is better avoided.”\n“Farewell then, noble Theophil. You have taught me more than I thought I could ever learn.”\n“It has been my pleasure,” said Theophil, and vanished.\n4. Peppi’s Resolve “I’m back on earth,” Dad murmured to himself as someone bumped into him. Acknowledging the latter’s excuses with a polite smile, Dad proceeded in haste to the Station Master’s office. To Dad’s surprise, Peppi rose from his chair as if he had been asleep.\n“You are really back, Tommy,” he yawned, rubbing his eyes. “I had a funny dream about some riot on my platform and that you hid in the women’s toilet together with some very strange characters. When the riot was over, you had a crazy chat with an odd being who looked like \u0026hellip; the devil!” He paused for a moment. “What a dream!”\n“It wasn’t a dream, Peppi,” said Dad.\n“Tommy, don’t tell me all this really happened! Nonsense: I must still be fast asleep!”\n“No, Peppi: you were not dreaming. In an inexplicable manner your eyes saw what I had perceived. It is as if we had a joint vision. And what is that strange bottle – there beside you on the table? It doesn’t look like Slivovitz.”\n“That odd locum gave it to me. You see, he came into my office and handed it to me with a smile. I fell fast asleep after I took a sip.”\n“A Mickey Finn?”\n“It tasted like tea with rum.”\n“May I have a look?” asked Dad.\nThe bottle was made of a black opaque material, too light to be ceramic and too heavily grooved to be glass. It looked alien. To Dad’s surprise, the cork refused to budge when he tried to remove it.\n“You’d better think twice before you take a sip,” said Peppi anxiously.\n“I only want to smell it,” explained Dad. “Mind if I try?”\n“Not at all,” said Peppi. Instantly, the cork gave way, and a fine aroma filled the room.\n“Peppi, it smells delicious. Are you sure it made you fall asleep?”\n“I didn’t sleep too well last night, Tommy. So perhaps it wasn’t the drink after all. Want to try a drop?”\nGingerly, Dad raised the bottle to his lips. He was startled when the liquid gushed into his mouth like water from a fountain.\n“The bottle likes you, Tommy,” said Peppi, amused.\n“It’s a potent drink,” said Dad when he regained his breath. “But it’s not liqueur! It’s some sort of a tonic. Mind if I have another drop?”\nDad’s face brightened after the second sip. A wave of confidence engulfed him, culminating in a sense of inner calm. The hurdles of everyday life and the fear of tomorrow faded into the distance.\n“You look just like you did in the old days, Tommy,” said Peppi, perplexed.\n“I feel it. And let me tell you, Peppi: I know that once again I can conquer the world.”\n“Is it this drink?”\n“Why don’t you take a sip? It’s your bottle,” Dad said, proffering the bottle.\nThe cork slipped out readily. Peppi sniffed the aroma appreciatively and took a hearty swig, then another.\n“Tommy, I feel like a new man – I have a new heart!” Peppi looked excited, elated. “It’s the same euphoria I felt after my first \u0026hellip; eh \u0026hellip; experience! Well, Tommy, both of us could do with a snack. But, before we get out of here, why don’t you have another sip from this bottle?”\nObligingly, Dad partook. He was about to have yet another when an inner voice urged caution. “I think this is as far as I go,” he said.\nPeppi reinserted the cork. By then, his demeanour had undergone a remarkable change. Peppi had always been an exceptionally tall and good-looking man, but his appearance was marred by his ingratiating smile and the self-effacing demeanour he assumed in his everyday life. Now an aura of distinction, of well-being, descended on him. The drifter from Vienna’s working classes had turned into a self-assured individual, aware of his standing.\n“Tommy, you must help me write my letter of resignation. I’m not going back to the station,” said Peppi over their first drink in the Kneipe.\n“But why, Peppi?”\n“Because I’m sick and tired of being the chief clown in that stupid circus. I have been coasting all my life and it’s high time I do something I like.”\n“The beer garden?”\n“We’ll have to keep it for a while. We need the money. But do you know what I’ve always wanted to do?”\n“You wanted to own a good business of your own, Peppi.”\n“Not just any type of business. My dream was to have an antiques shop of my own! Didn’t you know?”\n“I knew you loved antiques of all sorts. I remember how we used to stop and stare through the windows of Vienna’s main dealers whenever we passed by. But, Peppi, why didn’t you go and get a job in one of them?”\n“I tried,” said Peppi. “But they wouldn’t have me. My accent was too common. They had no room for a working-class boy.”\n“You never told me,” protested Dad.\n“What would have been the use? But now, Tommy, I know I can do it. I shall simply apprentice myself to one of the leading shops in town.”\n“Isn’t it too late in the day?” asked Dad anxiously. “You are two years older than me \u0026hellip;”\n“I’m 53!” smiled Peppi. “So what? I’ve stashed away some of the money I made during the War. And Helga will be supportive. She doesn’t like the beer garden. But she’d be proud to be the wife of a leading art or antiques dealer! And I know I shall make it, Tommy: where there’s a will, there’s a way.”\n“Go then, by this – thy strength!” Dad exclaimed. Then, highly embarrassed, he added: “I don’t know what made me use these words, Peppi. It was as if an invisible person prompted me.”\n“I think I know who it was,” said Peppi warmly. “And I am glad to have the blessing of both of you.” Pausing for a moment, he went on: “So come on, let’s draw up my letter of resignation.”\nThey drafted the letter over the next two drinks. When they were done, Peppi shrugged his shoulders and said: “I’ll be glad to see the last of that lousy uniform.”\nTime stood still as they sat in silence at their table in the Kneipe. Each was recalling their youth in Vienna, the years of separation, the struggle for survival and their unexpected reunion.\nPeppi broke the spell. “Tommy, will you really go back to Vienna when the Russians get out?”\n“Yes, Peppi. And you?”\n“I’m pretty sure Helga would refuse to leave Munich. But even if she did, I won’t go back.”\n“But why?”\n“Look, Tommy: in reality, Vienna was your home much more than mine!”\n“Peppi!” protested Dad.\n“Yes, Tommy, so it was. Oh, I know: you are a Jew and I’m a Viennese of the old stock. But, in truth, your position was better than mine.”\n“In what way?”\n“The Jews of Vienna were outside our class structure,” said Peppi. “No matter how persistently you kept knocking, some doors would remain firmly shut. The nobility, the gentry and the army frowned on you and some professions used their numerus clausus to exclude you. In the old days, you couldn’t have become a notary or an ambassador. But the arts, many professions – including medicine – and the business world welcomed a gifted Jewish kid. I, by contrast, was a working-class boy. My chances of rising in the world were slim. The foreman’s job at old Rosenberg’s was all I could traditionally aspire to. The partnership was the ultimate.”\n“All the same, Peppi – you were an insider whilst I was kept outside.”\n“Quite so! But like most Jews of your generation, you were content to remain a successful entrepreneur with a niche in your own community. It didn’t matter to you that you were on the fringes. I, Tommy, was not satisfied with my lot of an insider in the lower echelons of the pyramid.”\nThe waitress hovered in the background, indicating that they ought to order another drink. To Dad’s relief, Peppi decided against a further Slivovitz and settled for a cup of black coffee. For a while they continued to talk about the old days and their respective plans for the future. This time it was Dad who broke the spell, explaining that he had to prepare for another trip to Bologna.\n“After that, I have to fly back to my family in Tel Aviv,” he told Peppi. “I’m not sure when I’ll be back in Munich.”\nPeppi stood at the door until Dad disappeared round the corner. Stepping back into the Kneipe, he ordered another cup of coffee but, as soon as the waitress turned her back, got hold of his odd-looking bottle. The cork loosened obligingly.\n“Thanks, Theophil,” he said, taking a hearty swig.\n“You are welcome,” he mind was told.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-devil-in-munich/chapter-2/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"1-the-locum-and-his-provocation\"\u003e1.

Josephus and the Great Jewish Revolt I doubt if Pilkin and I would have become mates had it not been for the Josephus Flavius trial staged by TA.1 in 1950. Although the War of Independence was by then long over, Israel had not fully recovered from its economic and social effects. Commodities were scarce, prices were high and the black market was booming. One of the objectives of Israeli schools of that period was to turn its pupils into good citizens. Nobody was held in greater contempt than a traitor to the struggle for the survival of the two years old nation.\nA pedagogical tool used in this effort was the holding of historical trials of all those who had been untrue to the cause of the Jewish struggle for survival. Benedictus Spinoza, sad to tell, was one of the many victims. The prime target, though, was Josephus Flavius, held universally in contempt for his alleged betrayal of the Jewish struggle against the yoke of the Roman empire in the first century A.D.\nJosephus Flavius – Joseph ben Matityahu in Hebrew – was the heir of a cosmopolitan and hence assimilated family of priests. Little is known about his early years except that he obtained a liberal education. In his mid-twenties, he travelled to Rome to plead the cause of some zealots who had been sent for trial by Felix, the then procurator of Judea. Josephus secured an introduction to Nero Caesar’s wife, the promiscuous Popea, and persuaded her, by means of a bribe, to secure the dismissal of the charges.\nJosephus then spent a number of happy years in the metropolis of the world. On his return to Jerusalem, he discovered that the small protectorate was getting ready to raise the banner of revolt. He was sent to the Galilee by the conservative members of the Grand Sanhedrin, with instructions to nip the movement in the bud.\nJosephus relates in his autobiography how he attempted to carry out his mission but was overtaken by the tide. In the event, he found himself at the head of the liberation movement in the hilly north. He was given the task of fortifying and defending the township of Jodefet (Jotapata in Latin), an important centre of the rebels.\nWas Josephus blinded by the enthusiasm of the hour? Did his inner traditional though suppressed Jewish self get the better of his sophisticated and elegant veneer? Views differ. His conversion, though, did little to save the cause: the outcome was clear from the outset. True to tradition, a Roman army marched down from Antioch and, grinding slowly but steadily, quenched the rebellion mercilessly. The crucial chapter in the Galilee took place when the walls of Jodefet, manned by Josephus’ corps, came tumbling down. Scourging and crucifixion were amongst the punishments meted out to the freedom fighters caught alive.\nThose who managed to escape joined comrades defending lesser towns. Josephus and some of his men were trapped in a cave. When tribunes of the Roman army offered them their lives, Josephus was tempted. His comrades refused. After a vehement argument, the group agreed to commit communal suicide, drawing lots to determine the order of the executions. Josephus was one of the last caught. Reverting to his original design, he persuaded the other survivor to surrender together with him.\nInitially, Josephus was put in chains and was to be sent to Rome for punishment. Never at a loss, he insisted such a plan was wasteful because the Roman commander, Flavius Vaspasian, was soon to succeed to the throne upon Nero’s death. Sceptical yet gratified, Vaspasian relented. When the prediction came true, he granted the fugitive a pardon and, eventually, adopted him into his own family.\nAfter the fall Jerusalem, which was razed to the ground by Vaspasian’s son, Titus, Josephus proceeded to Rome. During the long reign of the Flavians, he composed two major historical works: ‘The Wars of the Jews and the Romans’ and ‘Antiquities of the Jews’. In defence of his defection, he pleaded a dream in which a divine voice prompted him to record the history of the Jewish revolt.\nIt has to be conceded that his book on the subject remains the main source of that sad chapter in human sufferings. But this achievement did little to cleanse his tarnished image. European and Jewish historians alike have dubbed him a coward and traitor. Many of them overlooked the basic fact that historical treatises – except Josephus’ tomes – were laconic on the subject.\n2. An Informal Planning Session over Pita Falafel TA.1’s historical trial of Josephus was meant to follow what had, by then, become a well established precedent amongst Israeli secondary schools. Three pupils renowned for their orthodoxy and nationalism, including fair Shosh who had written an epic essay on the heroism of the Great Revolt, were constituted judges. Pilkin, who was considered a fine orator and a sound performer, was to lead the prosecution. Difficulties arose when the Principal sought to nominate an attorney for the defence: nobody wanted to plead the cause of a Quisling. After some wranglings, I agreed to assume the role. Having studied Josephus’ extant writings, I concluded he had been misunderstood.\nA few weeks before the trial, Pilkin and I held an informal conference on a bench in Rothschild Boulevard over a Pita Falafel. Initially, Pilkin was too engrossed in his repast to concentrate on more mundane matters. Eventually, he smacked his lips, smiled with satisfaction and came to the point.\n“Look here, Bushi, we don’t want to spend too much time on this trial? Last term I bombed out in the algebra test and your performance in chemistry \u0026hellip;”\n“ \u0026hellip; the less said the better,” I muttered in disgust. “For the life of me, I can’t see why they force ‘humanists’ to take at least one science subject! What use is a science subject going to be to one of us?”\n“Ours not to question!” Pilkin replied but nodded sympathetically. “I suppose these topics are meant to broaden our horizons; give us a balance!”\n“I have enough trouble with Arabic without all this nonsense about chemistry. If you hadn’t lent me your notes when I was sick last month, I would’ve bombed the test in Arabic too!”\n“You lose a lot of time when you get these bouts of Asthma. All the more reason to economise on the time spent on this trial. So why not agree to \u0026hellip; streamline?”\n“We can try. What are your main accusations against Josephus?”\n“We’ll ‘indict’ him for poor military leadership, cowardice, assimilation, unreliability as historian and, of course, treason.”\n“My main concern is the last. The others involve a value judgment; and they are minor when compared with treason. For instance, Herodotus was not only the father of history but also the father of lies. And I don’t find our modern historians reliable. And why not drop this ‘assimilated’ Jew business. Most educated Jews of that period were assimilated.”\n“A question of degree!” Pilkin tried to sound firm.\n“True. But we know little about Josephus’ ‘status’ and affiliations prior to the Great Revolt. So if you leave that bit out, you can reduce your team by one witness. It’ll save a lot of time on preparation.”\n“All right then,” Pilkin nodded. “So I’ll call only four witnesses. And you?”\n“I won’t call witnesses. I’ll make my points by cross-examining yours.”\n3. Issues of Procedure Pilkin’s eyes popped wide open. For a few moments he gazed at me in disbelief. Based on his experiences in TA.1 and in debating clubs, he had formed the belief that all controversial issues had to be resolved by logical arguments based on written texts. He had no appreciation of the procedural devices used in courts and by committees of enquiry.\n“Is the method you have in mind OK?” he asked at long last.\n“Done all the times in real courts!”\n“Shosh tells me you watch trials from time to time! So do you want to become a lawyer?” Pilkin let his disapproval show.\n“Maybe. You see, I dropped into our District Court last year, when we had a break between these two silly maths and physics exams in Jaffa Street. The cases I heard were exciting!”\n“Rape trials?” Like all adolescents, Pilkin was interested in everything smacking of sex.\n“No! One was a running down case and the other an industrial accident. In both cases the defendants called no witnesses. Their lawyers broke the chaps who sued: the ‘plaintiffs’ in legal jargon, by subjecting them to awkward questions!”\n“Not very nice!”\n“Perhaps. But it was very efficient!”\n“But in our trial, shouldn’t we stick to the Talmudic procedure?”\n“But, honestly, Pilkin,” I protested, “what do we really know about Talmudic procedure except a lot of clichés!”\n“True,” agreed Pilkin sadly. “But, Bushi, I know nothing about modern courtroom procedure!”\n“Can’t say I know much. Still, we can watch a few trials together and get the basics. For the rest we can improvise.”\n“But court trials must be boring! I’ve no wish to become a lawyer or liar!”\n“But you want to become an actor!”\n“Precisely!”\n“Some lawyers are real showmen, Pilkin. One moment they are purring kittens only to turn into roaring lions when it suits them!”\n“Sounds interesting,” Pilkin reflected. “OK – let’s do it!”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/reunion-in-zermatt/chapter-2/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"1-josephus-and-the-great-jewish-revolt\"\u003e1.

Visit to Yentl’s Grave Earlier today I resolved to write my autobiography. I was mulling the idea over since the day Yentl came up with it. She had just finished reading the memoirs of an American politician. She thought his style was good and had appreciated his anecdotes. But, she asked, why did he presume others had an interest in his mundane manoeuvrings and dull existence on the fringes of Washington D.C.?\n“Some people just like to write; and they hope others are fond of reading,” I told her. “If you don’t like the book, put it away.”\n“So I shall. But you, Loeb, why don’t you write your autobiography?” It was typical of our relationship that, even after years of a satisfying marriage, Yentl continued to call me Loeb. “Darling” appeared too common and using my nickname – Pilkin – struck her as sacrilege. I, in turn, suppressed the urge to call her “honey” or “my pet”.\n“Don’t be silly, Yentl,” I chastised her. “What’s special about my life story?”\n“Everything about it.”\n“Thus spoke the man’s devoted wife.”\n“Do you know anyone else who started life as an odd jobs boy; managed to get into a first class secondary school; finished it with flying colours; then went for a career on the stage in Tel-Aviv and ended up as a Rabbi in Brooklyn?”\n“People change their careers. Many do.”\n“But you, Loeb, never intended to give up acting. You moved to America with a dream of finding a niche on Broadway. Then, unexpectedly, you ended up as a Rabbi with Schuls in New York and Tel-Aviv. And, Loeb, on top of it, you became a renowned faith healer. Isn’t all this out of the ordinary?”\n“Perhaps. But how about your hero’s estranged brother, our son who married out and our daughter, who never writes to her parents, except, of course, on Rosh-Hashanah?”\n“All the more interesting, Loeb; and you are a good writer and have an excellent style: in Hebrew, in English and, yes, in Arabic.”\n“Stop flattering me; I ain’t dumb.”\n“Perhaps not; but you are stubborn and unreasonable!”\n“And you want me to write an autobiography? What shall I call it: ‘Life of a Mule’?”\n“You’ll find a suitable title when you’ve made up your mind,” she brought the argument to an end.\nThe subject cropped up from time to time until Yentl’s demise from a heart attack in Safed, where we retired. On each occasion, I declined. Yentl, though, was not deceived: she was too shrewd. Knowing me well, she kept nagging. Did she know I would eventually cave in?\nDuring her life, I kept aloof. My existence was too comfortable to take on a new commitment. But the scene changed when I lost her. After many years beside an active, intelligent and interesting wife, I was – at the wrong time of life – on my own. For a while the long strolls, aided by my walking stick, and the reading sessions by the hearth during the long chilly evenings of Safed, kept me going. But they could not suppress the emptiness engulfing me. All my life, I had been a dynamic operator, a Ganzemacher. The mundane existence that had become my lot since Yentl’s death spelt out stagnation. I had to find something to keep me occupied: to silence the voice whispering that I had become a useless old loafer.\nAs against this background, Yentl’s idea assumed a new dimension. On the one hand, I retained my doubts about the value of an autobiography and felt trepidation when I reflected on the exposure of my life – my inner self – to the eyes of strangers. On the other hand, here was a new challenge: I had the chance of sharing (with those prepared to listen) the ups and downs of my odyssey. My boyhood friend, Bushi – now Professor Emeritus Dr. Peter Berger – encouraged me to go ahead. To use his words: “You need not be Genghis Khan to have a worthwhile life story.”\nMy decision firmed this morning, as I took my customary Shabbat morning walk to the cemetery. On the way to the grave I kept dreaming of Yentl’s Shabbat treat – the Cholent. The stripes of smoked beef and the beans tenderised in the slow oven melted in your mouth. Washed down with a glass of Carmel Hock, it was a meal fit for Kings and Princes. Notwithstanding my own skills as a chef, I could not match her master dish. Somehow, I never set the oven right or – worse still – added too much (or too little) Schmaltz. Conceding defeat, I got myself invited to the far inferior Shabbat dinners in my neighbours’ houses. This very evening I had been booked by friends whom Yentl and I had known since our arrival in Safed.\nHaving experienced meals in my host’s home on previous occasions, I was in a foul mood. A bout of food poisoning was on the cards. On top of it, I should have to listen to Miriam’s book of lamentations; and her darling of a husband – her Tachshit – would keep grinning surreptitiously as she addressed her discourse to poor me.\nThe weather did little to cheer me up. The skies were cloudy and shortly after I left home it started to drizzle. My broad hat could not shield me from a downpour. Still, it was my only cover. Holding the walking stick (on which I had come to depend) in one hand and balancing an umbrella in the other would have been preposterous: an act befitting a clown or Schlemiel. In any event, calling on Yentl empty-handed was unthinkable; and so I was carrying a bunch of Forget-Me-Nots (pansies) in my free hand.\nI was aware that orthodox friends frowned on my weekly Shabbat walk. To start with, it was a sin to walk beyond the “Thechum” (the area adjacent to your dwelling) although some smart fictive steps could have cured this defect. In addition, a walk to the graveyard on the day of rest was inappropriate for a Rabbi. I should have been in the Schul or at home engrossed in the Holy Book. Worse still, the carrying of any secular objects – such as flowers or even books other than the scriptures – is in itself a breach of the commandments. Punctilious critics might, further, mumble that bringing flowers to the dead is contrary to Jewish traditions. “What has Reb Zohar come to?” they would sigh.\nIgnoring their subtle voices, I persisted. We are told that “a man looks on the outward appearance but God looks on the heart” (Sam. I, 16:7). Can my twenty-minute walk to the remains of my late Yentl – a good observant Jewish wife of the old stock – defy His will? Does it derogate from the awe, love and respect I feel for Him? Can He be petty enough to take a jaundiced view of my weekly walk down memory lane?\nI feel even less sympathy for the jibes about my breach of tradition. Yentl loved flowers. She admired roses because they were majestic; carnations because they were cute; dahlias because of their rich petals and gladiolas for the variety and the depth of their colours. So now I bring flowers to her place of rest; and, quite regardless of tradition, I have the right to do so.\nWhenever possible, the flowers I bring her are Forget-Me-Nots. Yentl adored their expressive leaves – reminiscent of human faces – and was fascinated by the variety of the names given to them in different languages, for instance, Stiffmutterchen in German (meaning ‘Dear Mother-in-Law’) and Amnon ve’Tamar in Hebrew (based on the sad tale of the offspring of King David). She also believed that any husband, who brought Forget-Me-Nots to his chosen one, was a faithful lover.\nThe bunch I carried with me this morning was splendid. The leaves were fresh and the branches had been nicely trimmed. Yentl would be cheered up by my gift; and an insipid drizzle was not going to stop me from delivering it. To protect the flowers from the thickening drops, I pressed the bunch close to my chest just under the brim of my hat.\nBy the time I arrived in the cemetery, it was raining hard. My clothes were wet; but the Forget-Me-Nots were still looking fresh and inviting. Placing them at the foot of the tombstone, I sat down to regain my breath.\n“Loeb,” I heard her voice, “Loeb: how silly of you to come over on such a day. You’re as wet as a poodle!”\n“Poodles aren’t wet; and if I hadn’t come you would have scolded me because I didn’t. So how can a poor Schlemiel like me do the right thing – eh?”\n“You are ridiculous!”\n“Sure,” I conceded.\n“But why didn’t you take an umbrella?”\n“And do a balancing act with one hand holding my cane and the other an umbrella – eh? I’m not Coco the Clown; and we’re not in a circus.”\n“And my flowers will now get wet.”\n“But if I hadn’t come you wouldn’t have them!”\n“You’ve got a point there; and they are lovely. So thanks. But you better get home real fast, Loeb; or you’ll catch your death.”\n“I never catch colds,” I soothed her; “so don’t you worry. And I’ll take a hot shower as soon as I’m back. But I want to stay just for a short while; so don’t you nag.”\n“All right then; and also – Loeb – we need to have talk.”\n“Oh?”\n“Stop this ‘Eh’ and ‘Oh’ nonsense!”\n“Alright; alright!”\nFor a while I kept staring at Yentl’s grave. On all scores, she had been a good and devoted wife. I missed her and, of course, her splendid meals. Odd to say, I even missed the lashes of her tongue. In reality, her bark had been but a poor camouflage of the warm heart that guided her through life. Over the years, I had got used to her company and had come to depend on her. Without her, life was dull and void of meaning: tranquillity without an aim.\n“Loeb,” I heard her again; “you are slowly but surely becoming an impossible old man.”\n“Now what makes you say that?”\n“You, Loeb! Look at you! Tonight you are going to Miriam’s place; but you are looking around you with a crying face like a man sent to Siberia. Also, last week you got a letter from Ami. But it’s still on the mantle piece; you haven’t even opened the envelope. And when Ruth rang, you bit her head off. The poor girl burst into tears after she slammed the receiver; and she’s your own flesh and blood.”\n“But Miriam’s a lousy cook; and I’m sure Ami only writes to ask for money; that’s all he is after – that rotten son of yours. And Ruth is a pain. Why did she have to marry that Reform Jew? I suppose one of the boys in her own father’s Schul wasn’t good enough for her?”\n“Stop acting your role of Tevyeh, Loeb. Fiddler on the Roof is old hat. Let me tell you: we are in the twenty-first century: not in 1887. So grow up. Miriam may not be a brilliant cook but she has a heart of gold. So be glad somebody still cares enough to ask you for dinner. And why do you think our son is only after money? Can’t you – in the very least – read his letter? Perhaps he only wants to say ‘hello’; and stop disowning Ruth. You love her; so stop pretending.”\n“Maybe you are right,” I caved in.\n“So go home and be a Mensch. And, Loeb, you must find something to do; and I still think you better write that autobiography. It’ll give you a focus: and you need one.”\n“I’ll give it a thought!”\nOn my way back, the rain turned into a deluge. When I got home I was drenched; even my shirt was soaking wet. Having discarded my clothes, I immersed myself in a hot bath. After some ten minutes, I was once again myself: grumpy, disenchanted but fit. By the time I climbed out of the tub, my face was no longer pale and drawn.\nAttired in a comfortable track suit and stretching my legs under our old eiderdown – on the bed I used to share with Yentl – I let our recent conversation run through my mind. I was, of course, aware that I had been talking to myself: my own conscience was admonishing my oversized ego. There had been no Witch of Ein-Dor to raise Yentl from the dead; and spirits are unable to communicate. Yet the inner voice that had addressed me so peremptorily displayed Yentl’s robust common sense that had helped her diagnose problems and come up with solutions. The dialogue by her grave had had the same effect.\nSo the resolve to write had been made. But what literary form ought I to chose? Although many authors call their autobiography “memoirs” – and vice versa – the two are distinct types of compositions. An autobiography is centrifugal. The author, who is also the hero, narrates his odyssey. The landmarks are facets of his life. Political or global events are relevant only to the extent that they had a bearing on him. In contrast, memoirs are centripetal. The author covers significant events of his era. Undoubtedly, his orientation and outlook – his life philosophy or plain bias – colour his analysis. Yet the author’s personal role and his influence on the episodes related by him are of secondary importance. In theory, his identity may remain undisclosed.\nFor a self-centred individual like me, an autobiography constituted the natural vehicle. My preference was further dictated by my having lived most of my life in a niche of my own, away from the public arena. I observed episodes from outside – not together with those that triggered them off.\nAnother choice, too, was readily made. I had to write my tome in English. The circle of readers of Hebrew was too narrow. Rather than use my mother-tongue as a medium and leave the task of translation to others, it made sense to proceed directly in my acquired second language. After all, most of my sermons (Drashas) were delivered in English even if – out of necessity – they were laced with Yiddish and Hebrew words.\nThe narration of my story presented no problems: there are no blanks. My recollections commence in a period of deprivation, occasioned by Father’s sudden death. His demise overcast my childhood and my years in primary school. By the time I turned eleven, I had become the family’s principal breadwinner, hiring out my services as an ‘odd jobs boy’. In the process, I matured prematurely. In my last years in primary, I started to dream of becoming a great actor.\nMy early boyhood culminated by my admission to the model secondary school of Tel Aviv: Tichon Ironi A. My four years in “TA.1” (or “Tichon”) and the succeeding two and a half years in the Entertainment Corps of the Israeli army were followed by my studies at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. During this lengthy epoch the boy grew into a young man, whose great expectations centred on his aspiration to become a famous actor. All in all it was a happy even if tense period. The only cloud was a heart attack, which cast a shadow on my future.\nThe days of awakening (of sobering up) started after my graduation with a B.A. When the doors to the leading stages in Israel refused to open, I joined a less prominent theatre and then accepted a teaching post in TA.1, albeit insisting that I be allowed to conduct a course on drama. In addition, I appeared in secondary theatres, frequently as the lead role in Tevyeh the Milkman and from time-to-time in comedies such as the Malade Imaginaire. Eventually I became one of the employees of Israel’s Educational Television. One stabilising influence during this period was my marriage to Galya Hadar, a starlet of the Signon Theatre. Through her, I realised that in many ways a teacher’s life was more comfortable than an actor’s. Still, my ultimate goal in life remained a career on the stage. The dream was extant.\nOne of my appearances as Tevyeh led to a major change in my life. An American Rabbi, Moshe Margalioth, who was impressed by my performance, invited me to come to his hometown. During my first few years in New York, I was once again aspiring for a career as a performer. But although invitations kept coming from some ensembles, Broadway remained beyond my horizon.\nEventually Rabbi Margalioth persuaded me to enrol in a Yeshiva – a Jewish seminary. It was a crucial turn but I have had no reason to regret it. Upon my graduation, I was ordained and took up a post in my mentor’s own Schul in Brooklyn. Shortly thereafter, Galya, who had no wish to migrate, demanded a Get (a divorce). On the dissolution of our marriage, I was once again on my own.\nMoshe Margalioth had my future at heart. He secured it by introducing me to Yentl Jacobs. My marriage to her led me from strength to strength. The disorientated drifter, Chayim Rosenberg (who had changed his surname to Rosenne in the army) became a member of the Jewish establishment. As Loeb Zohar – Bright Lion – I developed into a leading American Rabbi, an acclaimed healer and a man of substance. During my years with the Jewish Wellbeing Foundation (originally referred to as the Moshe Margalioth Foundation) I was able to support deserving causes. It was one of the truly blissful periods in my long life.\nRetirement in Safed was meant to be the happy ending of a satisfying journey. Yentl’s sudden demise upset the scales: the downhill trip had started. Ten months on my own transformed me into a misanthropic old man. Nothing seemed to please me any longer.\nIt is my hope that the writing of my autobiography will reverse the trend by giving me a new objective. When I am back on track I shall – once again – have a focus. Even if my effort is not crowned with literary or scholastic success it ought to serve its purpose. In any event, an expedition is frequently more rewarding than the arrival at the destination. So tomorrow I start; that is, if I do not succumb to food poisoning tonight.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novels/bright-lion/part-1/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"1-visit-to-yentls-grave\"\u003e1. Visit to Yentl’s Grave\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarlier today I resolved to write my autobiography. I was mulling the idea over since the day Yentl came up with it. She had just finished reading the memoirs of an American politician. She thought his style was good and had appreciated his anecdotes.

A model primary school pupil, a boy scouts leader and a fine cricket player were on the credit side. A tricky fellow, one ready to snitch when it suited him, and a mercenary to boot, were remarks made by those who disliked him. One of them told me that Ranjan would display enthusiasm when he was the key figure in some sporting event, but often lost interest when it was the turn of others.\nThe most telling observation came from one of his Tamil classmates. Ranjan had sought to gain popularity by being good. But the mask was thin. Right from primary school Ranjan exhibited vanity and, alas, a dislike for members of Sri Lanka’s substantial minority groups. The only exception – to manifest itself in secondary school – was Ranjan’s penchant for girls of the Burgher community, the descendants of mixed marriages of Dutch men with Sinhalese or Tamil women. Ranjan found these girls appealing and enjoyed their liberal outlook.\nI concluded that, in his early years, Ranjan had been neither a saint nor a villain. He had been human; yet an extremely self-centred fellow right from the start. He had also displayed an uncanny ability to get his way at all cost. Crossing him was unwise.\nI met Ranjan for the first time at a party in my college in Oxford. By then, he had completed his BA with second class honours. His hope was to improve this sound but inglorious result with a spectacular performance in Oxford’s Bachelor of Civil Law (usually referred to as the BCL).\nNoticing my patent awkwardness, Ranjan had aided me to fit into the party. In no time the discussion turned to Israeli folklore and aspirations. This enabled me to take part. Ranjan too talked. He had familiarised himself with the controversial subject and was aware of the manifestoes of both sides. That evening he took the Israeli line; but I wondered what views he would express in a gathering dominated by Arabs. A casual observation by a Rhodes scholar suggested that Ranjan’s enthusiastic references to Israel came to some listeners as a surprise.\nFor the next few weeks, I kept running into Ranjan in the restaurants and coffee houses near the Bodleian library. Occasionally, we had tea together in Broad Street. Ranjan kept talking about political affairs. After a while it dawned on me that, notwithstanding his legal background, Ranjan aspired for a role in politics. He was active in the Oxford Union, the cradle of many political careers, and, in due course, was elected president for a term. His focus was – I gleaned – the politics of his home country – Sri Lanka, still known as Ceylon in those days.\nDuring his last year at Oxford, the two of us saw a great deal of one another. Ranjan was always ready to help when the need arose. I was at that time fretting over the direction of my project. Ranjan smoothed matters out for me by discussing my problems with some academics of his acquaintance. The frosty atmosphere I had encountered till that time gave way to friendly guidance and assistance. Even the librarians started to smile when I asked for advice.\nRanjan had managed to pull the right strings; and he knew how to detect them when needed. It did not take me long to discover that he had performed comparable acts of kindness for other acquaintances. Some benefited from his patronage in Oxford Union affairs; others appreciated his guiding hand in problems related to the circle of Ceylonese students, and others still had sought his advice in collegiate politics. Ranjan’s reward was the general esteem shown to him by the academic community surrounding him; and his ego kept being bolstered. Effectively, Ranjan’s charisma conferred on him a mantle of distinction.\nIn the normal course of events, Ranjan and I would have remained mere acquaintances with benevolent feelings for one another. I preferred the backstage to the limelight; and I was a loner. Ranjan’s orientation differed. Our hobbies, too, belonged to separate worlds. His centred on people and on current affairs. He was always up to date. Mine were porcelain and plastic art.\nI recall a commercial case which took both of us down to London. In the spare time left, Ranjan went to political rallies and attended meetings of some Ceylonese organisations. I spent my time visiting art galleries. Ranjan, who knew I was too poor to buy good pieces, could not comprehend the pleasure I derived from window shopping and from trotting through museums. I, in turn, felt no empathy with his activities. London was a fascinating city. Why would anyone prefer spending his time on rallies and current events – bound to be forgotten within a short while – to relishing the rich cultural scene?\nWhat drew us together – cementing a friendship which lasted for years – was a mutual ability to see each other’s point of view and to act discreetly when needed. One typical event of this sort took place shortly after that spell in London. We were sitting in our accustomed coffee house in Oxford’s Broad Street, engaged in a discussion of the litigation that had drawn us to the High Court. Other students dropped in, greeted Ranjan warmly but – as was to be expected – bypassed me. Ranjan enjoyed his popularity and relished the attention showered on him. Then, unexpectedly, his smile changed into a frown. He was staring at a group of young men and women, who had just stepped through the door. One of the newcomers – an attractive girl – beamed as soon as she spotted him.\n“I didn’t expect to find you here,” she said, as she left her group with a nod and, following the usual introductions, joined our table. Her warm, alluring, voice camouflaged her mid-European accent.\n“I didn’t intend to go for tea, Lillo; but Peter needed a rest after his spell in the library.” The smile had now returned to Ranjan’s face; but his eyes remained watchful.\n“So this is your new friend,” she retorted readily and, turning to me, added: “Ranjan speaks a lot about you; it’s nice meeting you.”\n“Thanks,” I said, dumbfounded.\n“So he did not tell you about me?” she grinned.\n“Why didn’t you tell me you had such an attractive girl friend?” I asked Ranjan.\n“Fear of competition!”\n“That would be the day,” I could not help responding, thinking to myself that a vivacious, elegantly dressed and well-groomed girl like Lillo was altogether out of my reach.\n“Why are you so unsure of yourself?” Lillo spoke kindly. “Some girls are keen on nice, dependable, men! Ranjan says that’s precisely what you are!”\n“Maybe,” I said awkwardly, adding – determined to change the subject: “And how long have you known Ranjan?”\n“A few months,” she responded willingly. “But we got engaged only four or five weeks ago. Soon I’ll get my ring.”\nRanjan’s expression tightened as she spoke. I sensed that these two had a lot to say to one another. Ranjan had been startled by her arrival in the company of other men. She was, however, too smart, too worldly, to seek to justify herself.\n“I better return to the library,” I told them. “I have to read two new American cases.”\n“See you later then,” responded Lillo. Ranjan just nodded.\nRanjan must have appreciated my tact. During the next few days, I met him in the ante-hall of the Bodleian – our regular reading room – and on two occasions we went together for morning coffee. He told me about his home in Colombo, about a term he had spent in Freiburg University in Southern Germany, and about the activities of the Oxford Union. Lillo’s name was not mentioned by either of us.\nThen, unexpectedly, I ran into her in the coffee house in Broad Street. She had arrived together with another girl but, as soon as her companion departed, joined my lonely table.\n“Do you come here regularly?” she wanted to know.\n“Well, yes,” I replied. “The coffee is quite good and I like the food.”\n“Good value,” she agreed; then added awkwardly: “have you seen Ranjan today?”\n“He’s in the reading room alright; but – you know – when they write a paper, they skip meals.”\n“How about yourself?”\n“I read for a D.Phil.”\n“I know. So you don’t have to present a paper?”\n“Only my thesis; when I’m ready to submit. It’ll take some time.”\nShe digested the information, but her mind was still on Ranjan. She wanted to tell me something but, for some reason, was tongue-tied. I thought it best to let her take her time.\n“Don’t you find it difficult to write in English,” she asked at long last. “It’s not your mother tongue, surely?”\n“Of course it isn’t,” I told her, startled by the unexpected turn of the conversation. “But, you know, the art of composition – the art of good writing – is one and the same in most languages. The difficulty is more in the use of foreign idioms and in structuring sentences. It takes some time to adjust – but it can be done.”\n“I wish I was as confident as you,” she told me. “I am learning Sinhala; and it’s terribly hard.”\n“Sinhala?” I asked, appreciating where we were heading but playing for time.\n“Well, Sinhalese; Ranjan’s mother tongue,” she explained. “I’ll need to be conversant when he takes me to Colombo.”\n“But do you really want to live in Asia, Lillo?” I asked tactlessly. “You are very European.”\n“I’ll go to any place Ranjan chooses,” she replied. “And I must be an asset to him when he becomes a judge at home. So I am training myself to wear a sari and to act – you know, to behave – like Ceylonese girls.”\n“You think Ranjan wants to be a judge?” I let my surprise show.\n“Don’t you think he’s just right for such a job?”\n“He may be,” I dodged the question. “But doesn’t he want to enter politics?”\n“No, that’s not what he wants. And, you know, a politician in Ceylon ought to have a local wife.”\n“It helps in other countries too,” I pointed out, “except that in Israel an American wife is an asset!”\nShe giggled and was about to say something, but then her eye caught a group of young Europeans of her acquaintance. One of them stepped over and greeted her. Before long she departed in their midst.\n“Give my regards to Ranjan,” she said before she left.\nWhen I returned to the library, Ranjan had left the reading room. For a while, I tried to concentrate on some American authorities I had discovered. But it was no good. My mind kept straying back to Ranjan and Lillo. Had he really promised to take her with him to Ceylon? Was I wrong in thinking that his aim was a career in politics? My instincts told me Ranjan was not coveting an appointment to the Bench. The slow pace, severe atmosphere and the secluded life of a judge were incompatible with his energetic, liquid and gregarious personality. But, then, how could his fiancée be so confident that Ranjan had set his heart on a legal career? Did she jump to conclusions just because he was reading for a degree in law?\nSomething, I sensed, did not add up. If Lillo was as close to Ranjan as she indicated, he would have discussed his future with her. He had dropped hints of his plans for a future in politics to a recent acquaintance like myself. True, his hints fell short of a heart-to-heart discussion of the subject. But why had he kept his guard in his dealings with her?\nI raised the subject of Ranjan’s future a few days later, when the two of us went for a curry. To Ranjan’s Sinhalese palate the dishes were too mild – spicy stews without a sting. I kept drinking one glass of water after another, trying hard to stop sweating. I made my move as we dug into a sugary dessert.\n“Why did you enrol in the BCL, Ranjan?” I asked after a pause. “Do you want to be a judge?”\nRanjan thought the question over carefully. It was, actually, a reasonable enquiry. The prestigious Bachelor of Civil Law – an Oxford postgraduate degree – was open only to the top graduates of established English and foreign universities. A good result secured a ready entry into any leading law firm or barristers’ chambers in London. A ‘first’ earmarked the bearer for a role at the top of the Bar, with a sound chance of elevation. Needless to say, a sound BCL was just as highly appreciated in Britain’s former colonies. Ceylon was no exception in this regard.\n“Do you think it is the right career for me?” asked Ranjan.\n“I am not sure,” I prevaricated. “It may be too stultifying, too isolated for you.”\n“It might very well be,” confided Ranjan. “My real dream is …”\n“ … the government?” I interjected as he hesitated.\n“Precisely,” agreed Ranjan. “Do you think I’ll make it?”\n“I can’t tell,” I conceded candidly. “I don’t know enough about Ceylonese politics. Don’t you need certain contacts?”\n“I have them,” confided Ranjan. “And I know how to make doors open themselves.”\n“You don’t mind the … concessions every politician has to make?”\n“You can’t make an omelette without breaking eggs,” he summed up.\nRanjan had taken off his mask. I knew my reading of his character had been right from the start. At the same time, I felt sympathy for Lillo. Had her passion for the attractive Ceylonese prince hoodwinked her altogether? Didn’t she realise that the intensity of feelings she had alluded to was probably one-sided?\nHaving opened up to me once, Ranjan soon dropped his guard altogether. He had, undoubtedly, set his target high. His goal was the Presidency. His resolve to get there was not affected by the obstacles he was bound to face. They firmed his resolve.\nHe was aware that the ride would not be smooth. His father’s early death, coupled with the patriarch’s inaptitude for business, posed financial obstacles in Ranjan’s path. These, though, could be sidelined by his own skill. The family’s background constituted a graver hurdle. The Jeyaratnes were old stock, dating their prominence to days long past. The plebians, who had jumped over their shoulders in recent years – moving into the top notches in the tight-laced community – had little regard and affection for their former peers. To climb high, Ranjan had to overcome the dislike and suspicions of the populist front.\nRanjan was not oblivious of the difficulties bound to confront him. But he trusted his ability. He knew also that he would have to bide his time. This, too, posed a problem. Notwithstanding his sagacity, Ranjan had remained an impatient – perhaps even hungry – youth. His main hope was that Fortuna would come to his aid at the right moment. He trusted his capacity to see a chance and grab it.\n“But, Ranjan, wouldn’t a foreign wife add yet another obstacle?”\n“She would,” he responded readily.\n“Well?”\n“Sometime girls read too much into what a man tells them,” he said after a pause. He then added: “And who is the girl waiting for you back home?”\n“I had one. We lived together and worked together, but she sent me packing,” I stuttered.\n“Is that why you are here?”\n“That and the difficulty of climbing up the ladder without her beside me. I don’t have the instincts and the speed of a good courtroom advocate. I didn’t want to remain a backbencher in our legal world.”\n“No scope for teaching?”\n“Not really.”\n“I see,” he observed sympathetically.\nThis conversation drew us further together. For a few months we kept running into one another. Occasionally, Ranjan invited me to join Lillo and himself when they went to concerts or travelled to London for choice performances at the West End. Such trips gave me an insight into their lives. Lillo was the one deeper in love. Ranjan was smart enough to let her call the shots; but the reins remained in his hand.\nWhen the summer term drew to its end, Ranjan worked like a beaver. All the same, he ended up with but a Class II. Sensing that such a degree provided insufficient ammunition for an immediate move to a promising career at home, he accepted an Assistant Lectureship at the University of Malaya in Singapore. The newly established Law School provided a good springboard and the salary was attractive.\nLillo welcomed the forthcoming move to the westernised Eastern metropolis. She put her studies of Sinhala on hold, discarded her saris and went for a shopping spree for clothes befitting a young academic’s wife. Ranjan was tight-lipped. I suspected that he regarded the move a detour; an unavoidable side trip on the way to Eldorado. All the same, he was determined to do a good job. A prodigal returning to Colombo following a spell overseas would find openings as long as his record was unblemished and projected reliability.\nRanjan’s farewell party was attended by many of his friends and teachers. It was a gala affair, with Lillo hovering all over as befitted a gracious hostess. Her beautiful figure, sparkling attire and perfect make-up gained many an admiring look from both Ranjan’s contemporaries and peers. I was convinced Fortuna was being kind to him. His accomplished wife would now have ample time to prepare herself ‘to go native’ when the time came for his next move. With her by his side, he was bound to reach the top.\nRanjan’s departure left a void in my life. I had got used to talking to him about my problems, to sharing his and, above all, to watching his interplay with others. The coffee house in Broad Street lost its lustre. During tea breaks, I went to a joint at the covered market, where the steaming mugs of cheaply brewed coffee or tea were accompanied by a generous slice of buttered toast. An Austrian delicatessen stall, also within the precinct of the market, turned out to be a source of excellent continental sandwiches and snacks. I preferred them to the meals in the restaurants I used to frequent with Ranjan and Lillo.\nTowards the end of term, field research induced me to move for a few weeks to London. The need to economise induced me to stay in a ramshackle old club. One evening, I spotted Ranjan and Lilo as I proceeded to Strand Underground station on my way home after a day at the Middle Temple library. They, I suspected, were on their way to a theatre in Aldwych. Ranjan appeared not to see me. Lillo was too immersed in him to notice anyone else.\nBack in Oxford, I had to knock my thesis into shape. At the very same time I started to face financial problems. Notwithstanding my frugal existence, I was running out of money. My father – a generous man – encouraged me to persevere. He was prepared to go on supporting me. But, as he was ageing, I had my qualms. In addition, the wet climate of Oxford was undermining my fragile health.\nEventually, I wrote to seek Ranjan’s counsel. His advice revealed a hitherto unchartered way out. A new position had been established in his university. Notwithstanding the incompletion of my research, Ranjan encouraged me to apply. He knew the pure common law system applicable in Singapore was, as yet, alien to me. Nonetheless, he thought I should be able to master it in my stride and opined that the post would leave me adequate time to complete the thesis. Thus encouraged, I put in my application and, to my surprise, got the job.\nOn my way to Singapore, I made a stopover in Ceylon. Ranjan had returned home for a short visit in order to take part in some local celebrations. He thought it advisable to brief me before I put in my appearance at the Law School in Singapore.\nRanjan met me in the airport. After the basic exchange of civilities, he lead the conversation directly to the Law School. He seemed content, told me about his successful ventures into Singapore’s emerging stock exchange and had a great deal to say about the local legal world. He had befriended some of the young courtroom stars but spoke with some disdain of their extravagant lifestyles and insular outlooks. To my surprise, Lillo’s name was not mentioned.\nShe remained out of bounds during my entire stay. Had Ranjan left her back in Singapore for fear of his mother’s reaction to a European wife? Ranjan respected his matronly mother and, I sensed, would go to a considerable length to protect her sensitivities.\nTo my growing discomfort, Ranjan did not allude to Lillo as we visited Kandy and Nuwara Eliyah – the well-known resorts adjacent to Colombo – and the houses of some of our former associates in Oxford. One such visit made me reflect afresh on the Lillo issue. Shortly after the formal introductions, the middle aged, sari wearing, mistress of the house addressed me in Yiddish.\nIt turned out she had been ‘Sara Stiglitz’, a typical East European name. She had met her Sinhalese husband in a conference in Spain, fell in love with him and returned with him to his native Ceylon. It took her some two years to master Sinhala and to adapt to her new environment. By the time we met, she had been happily married for over ten years, had given birth to two sons and was considered by all her friends a naturalised native.\n“So my Yiddish gave you a turn,” she giggled.\n“Well, you even look Sinhalese.”\n“My mother’s maiden name was Nissim,” she confided. “So, you see, I look like a girl from Yemen. This made things easier for me. The main problem was to learn to walk properly in a sari. But I was determined.”\n“Do they treat you well?” I ventured, adhering to Yiddish.\n“Like any other member of the family,” she answered proudly.\nIt dawned on me that if Lillo coloured her beautiful blonde hair black, she could have the same success. Despite her Swiss background, she had readily fitted into the British milieu. Why then should she find it difficult to adjust to the Ceylonese world?\nI kept reflecting on the issue during the remaining days of my short visit. It irked me that despite a number of opportunities, Ranjan refrained from mentioning her name. Still, to save embarrassment, I toed the line.\nIn the end, Lillo’s name cropped up just before my flight onwards to Singapore. Following a pleasant meal in a Chinese restaurant – with a menu including mildly spiced dishes suitable for a Western palate – Ranjan drove me to the airport. As we left Colombo, Ranjan handed me a parcel and asked me to deliver it to Agnes.\n“Agnes?” I let my surprise show.\n“She works in the Registrar’s department. Her surname is Lim.”\n“But, Ranjan, don’t you want me to take something back for Lillo?”\n“Lillo is not in Singapore!”\n“Where is she?”\n“I’ve no idea! You see, we split – just before I left London.” He said no more; neither did I. For the remaining 40 minutes of our drive to the airport, an awkward silence descended on the car.\n“Agnes is a live wire,” confided Ranjan when we entered the departure hall. “She might introduce you to some pleasant girls.”\n“That would be nice,” I said.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/a-candid-obituary/chapter-2/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eMy knowledge of Ranjan’s youth is based on what he thought fit to tell me and on occasional remarks of  his contemporaries.

A Confused Day Bill Riggs was waiting for me at the arrival hall of Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport. He was, actually, looking fresher and more vigorous than he had ever appeared in Singapore. For a short while we gossiped about mutual friends in Singapore, about my forthcoming book and about his own work in his London firm. Then, as if by prior arrangement, we turned to business. I started by expressing my doubts respecting the outcome.\n“So you think that both sides have a shaky case?” Bill asked.\n“I think so. The outcome depends on the Judge’s assessment of the truthfulness of the witnesses. If he accepts our version of the facts, my Report is bound to convince him that we acted in the manner of reasonable and well informed bankers.”\n“And if he accepts their version?”\n“We are sunk; but, then, their case is as uncertain as ours. Their Expert is bound to make a comparable concession.” Pausing for a moment, I added anxiously: “Do you agree?”\n“I do. Actually, we’ve arranged a meeting with the other party in our office at 3.00 pm. It would be good if you could attend; they are bringing their expert. I only hope you are not too tired?”\n“I slept on the ‘plane; so I should be alright.”\nAfter I had unpacked my suitcase, I dropped onto the bed and stared apprehensively at the ivory coloured telephone. Closing my eyes in resignation, I picked up the receiver and dialled my home number. For a while the telephone kept ringing. I was about to replace the receiver when I heard the click.\n“I was sleeping!” As always, Pat’s complaining voice irritated my ears.\n“You told me to ring you as soon as I reached the hotel.”\n“You didn’t tell me you will get there so early! Here it is after midnight.”\nAs always, Pat’s nagging voice was pushing me into a corner. She was an intelligent woman but, unfortunately, quite incapable of looking beyond the horizon imposed by her background. A professional man’s commitment to matters entrusted to him had remained incomprehensible to her.\n“Oh, all right then; ring me when you have news”. The click of the receiver dropping back into its cradle was music to my ears.\nWhen I had recovered, I picked the receiver, smiling with anticipation. “So you have arrived safe and sound in your hotel, Uncle? Do you have a nice room?”\n“A suite; and a nice one at that; but something is remiss: You are not in London”.\n“We’ll soon put this right.” she was laughing happily now.\n“The sooner the better; and you know I was tempted to ring you from the ‘plane. But got confused”\n“That’s not like you – I mean, when you’re on a case.”\n“Not the case; the catalogue we talked about when we last spoke; you see, the house near Woodstock: it belonged to an old friend; the banker Arthur Smithies. Does his name ring a bell?”\n“Of course it does; you kept telling ‘her’ about him again and again.” Yuan Ming invariably referred to herself in days past – to the little girl of my early days in Singapore – in the third person.\n“You even drew his sketch, without having ever seen him!” I reminded her. “I still have it; you called it: ‘Uncle’s friend Mr Arthur’.”\nFor a moment both of us were silent. Then, unexpectedly, she asked: “The yellow milk jug; have you really seen it before?”\n“I have; it was in a catalogue he showed me when we met in 1981 in the Athenaeum.”\n“No wonder it looked familiar to you; so you came face to face with your past during the flight. I want to know all about it. But look, Uncle, before you start telling me, have you had something to eat; and aren’t you tired?”\n“We had breakfast on the ‘plane; but, yes, I’m tired.”\n“You sound it; so have a shower and go to bed; and when are you going up to Woodstock?”\n“Tomorrow, if I can get away from the case; we have a meeting this afternoon; a last minute attempt to settle, I suspect.”\n“Then you must have a good rest now. Ring me again when you are back from Woodstock. I’ll come over soon.”\nAs I had anticipated, the meeting in Bill Riggs’ office failed to produce a settlement. Shortly after it started, all of us realised that the conflict was not between the two companies, which had to continue trading with each other, but the two executives who had negotiated the contract: Philip Whitehead and Tony Blackburn. All attempt to reason with the two fighting cocks failed. After some three exasperating hours, in which they traded thinly veiled insults, they brought the meeting to a stormy end.\nNotwithstanding their exasperation, Bill and his counterpart in the other camp had a confidential exchange, in which each agreed to explore the possibility of a sensible settlement with people at the top. Another meeting was, accordingly, scheduled for the next day. I could not hide my relief when Bill said, with a twinkle in his eye, that the presence of experts would not be required.\nI went to bed early but, as was to be expected, woke up in the early hours of the morning. Feeling too comfortable to get up, I kept musing about the role of chance in a man’s life. Meandering through my life story, I recalled Fortuna’s intervention in my early childhood, when we were refugees in Marseilles. Father had secured us a visa to Australia but mother, who had turned an ardent Zionist after the Anschluß, insisted that we wait for another three days for a visa to Palestine. I often wonder how my life would have proceeded if that visa had not been issued in time. What would a boyhood in Sydney have been like?\nLater on, in my teens, chance induced me to dash my mother’s hopes of seeing her only son studying medicine. A spell in the Courts of Law in Tel Aviv, during a break between two examinations conducted on the premises of the neighbouring Department of Education, roused my interest. Some further visits during the long vacation convinced me that my future was in the Law. It amused me to think that, if the examinations had been held in a different part of town, I might have ended up as yet another physician who lacked a genuine desire to cure the sick.\nEven my unexpected decision to abandon my legal practice and read for a doctorate in Oxford was triggered off by a chain of events beyond my control. To start with I had been turned down by the woman I loved. I was deflated and soon started to avoid my friends. Shortly thereafter a Judge, whom I respected, told me I lacked the attributes of a courtroom advocate.\nI knew that some good law firms would gladly offer me an appropriate backroom position. But I was too young and too ambitious to compromise and, in consequence, felt my world was caving in. When a former classmate returned to Tel Aviv with enthusiastic accounts of his two years in Oxford, I decided to apply for admission. Again, Fortuna smiled: despite my indifferent undergraduate results, my research record opened Sesame.\nMy two years in Oxford had a profound effect on my future. To a point, the successful completion of my Oxford project was due to the devoted guidance of my two supervisors and to my own perseverance. Fortuna, though, had once again displayed her subtle hand. She had directed my feet to Crawford \u0026amp; Co. and to the office of the firm’s Managing Partner, Arthur Smithies. Initially, his readiness to assist me was triggered off by his interest in my subject. His resolve was bolstered when he discovered our common interest in art.\n“Coincidence” I deliberated. “You think you are in charge and assert proudly that you make your own decisions; but where would you be if Fortuna had turned her back on you?”\n4. Reflections on the Oxford Train Later in the morning, I took the express train to Oxford. As I leafed again through the catalogue of the forthcoming auction, I identified some further pieces of porcelain I had seen before. I also recognised a number of the traditional English paintings of the estate: they had been displayed in Birchin Lane.\nAs the express train sped out of London, my thoughts centred again on my late benefactor. Some four weeks after our initial interview, I had received a parcel with documents relevant to my quest. Some came from the archives of his own bank; others from merchant banks that had, originally, sent me discouraging replies; and others still were from the private collections of certain families. He had, in addition, enclosed a set of standard forms of letters of credit used by London banks during the 19th century. The only task left to me was to find the connecting threads and to consider the significance of individual clauses. Thanks to Arthur Smithies, I had proved my case.\nArthur Smithies assistance did not end there. A hand written letter, accompanying the parcel, encouraged me to call on him when I came to London. During the succeeding months, we had many a lunch in Crawford \u0026amp; Co.’s cafeteria or in a nearby restaurant.\nLater in the year, I started to send him the drafts of the chapters of my thesis. Naturally, I did so only after they had been perused by my supervisors. By then, most blemishes had been eliminated. Frequently, though, Arthur Smithies, drew my attention to some remaining inconsistencies of language and of textual analysis and added, in the margin, remarks which assisted me to further polish up my plain style.\nAnother indication of his goodwill was my constant receipt of catalogues of different auction houses in London. Some came houses of whose existence I had been unaware. In time it dawned on me that a dedicated collector could, occasionally, get real bargains at the less renowned sales rooms. Generally, the trick was to sit or stand at the far end of the room, where others did not notice you, and to raise your hand at the right moment.\nOn some occasions, my eye caught Arthur Smithies. I recall how, in an auction in Chelsea, I spotted him in one of the front rows, engrossed in his catalogue and looking as calm and as composed as ever. His expression did not change when the auctioneer picked up a handsome cup and saucer. Just a slight nod of his head indicated that he had entered the arena. Within a few seconds he was locked in a dog fight with another front-bencher who raised his hand excitedly at each prompting of the auctioneer. Then, within less then a minute, the skirmish was over. Arthur Smithies shook his had slightly and immersed himself again in the catalogue. I realised that Arthur Smithies was not prepared to pay more for a piece than its worth.\nI saw Arthur Smithies less regularly during the months following this episode. The thesis was nearing completion. My main task during the period was to verify citations, to ensure I had not overlooked any major legal decision and, generally, to get on with the menial tasks of preparing the indices, tables of cases, a bibliography and an abstract. This type of work was best carried out in my own room off Oxford’s Abingdon Road. But even so, I went up to London from time to time, occasionally for an auction but, more often, to consult texts which were not available in Oxford. Usually, when I finished my work in the respective reading room, I took a train to Bank Station in order to call on Arthur Smithies. We had by then become friendly and, in many ways, a trip to London appeared incomplete without a short meeting with him. Brian Davies was another person I used to visit when work took me to London. Our common interest in art laid the foundation for an acquaintance.\nWhat had impressed me most during the entire period was Arthur Smithies ingrained dignity and self-control. The only occasion on which I found him out of humour took place on a bleak November day. I was reading The Times in the waiting room, when a loudly dressed gentleman, smirking victoriously, was escorted to the lift by Brian Davies, whose face was set. As I entered Arthur Smithies room, I was startled to see he was ruffled.\n“Is something the matter, Mr Smithies?” I asked as he invited me to sit down.\n“Not really” he said, after a pause. “But some customers can get under your skin.”\n“May I possibly ask what happened? Is it an unpleasant default situation?”\n“Nothing like it. If a customer gets into difficulties without fault, we seek to accommodate. This is why we’re so careful when we accept new customers. No; that fellow, whom you must have seen leaving my room, was haggling with me about the rate of interest on his firm’s overdraft!”\n“Is this uncommon?” I asked, surprised.\n“No; of course not; and, again, if a customer is decent when he raises the matter, we bend backward to help him. It was the way he went about it.”\nHis eyes projected indignation. I, in turn, feared to intrude. It seemed best to keep mum. In the event, Arthur Smithies went on without any prompting on my part.\n“I think I told you about Timberflashings in Nova Scotia; we have been their bankers for years and still issue all their letters of credit. It has been a good business relationship since the turn of the century. But things changed when the firm was taken over by an American group. I suppose it is only natural that the new owners want to use an American bank. I would have no right to resent that. But instead of a straight change over they are constantly haggling with us.”\n“Are they unpleasant when they do?”\n“Plain rude is the word. That fellow told me that Chase offered them a line of credit at ½ per cent below ours; and when I said we provide a different service, including the investigation of ventures with new potential clients, he said they didn’t need our help. And the way he put it: ‘All we want is a cheap line of credit; and we can look after ourselves; so if your bank can’t give us a better rate of interest, we’ll take our business elsewhere’.”\n“What did you say?” I could not help asking.\n“I needed time to control my temper; so I kept studying the file. In the end I agreed to reduce our rate by ¼ of a per cent. When he continued to haggle, I told him that I couldn’t cut our profit margin any further. He said he would think it over.”\n“I believe he’ll accept” I said.\n“I think you are right” he said, regaining his composure as people do when they have given vent to their feelings. Then, with a ghost of his usual smile, he added with a mental shrug: “I suppose he was bluffing. Chase may have offered him a better rate than ours but probably tagged on some extra charges. Still, this round goes to him. So be it. What I can’t stand is his downright rudeness. Let him take his business elsewhere if he wishes; he’ll soon find out which bank furnishes the better service; we are proud of our record!”\nTo my relief, Arthur Smithies dismissed the unpleasant incident from his mind over a pleasant lunch in a nearby pub. As I took my leave, he asked whether I had given some thought to what I wanted to do after the completion of my research work.\n“Not really” I told him; “I\u0026rsquo;ve been too busy with the thesis.”\n“In its final form it is fine.”\n“Thanks,” was all I could bring out, adding “and thanks for all you help.”\n“It has been a pleasure,” he said with his usual warm smile.\nSome five weeks after this conversation, I handed my thesis in at the University’s Registry. Dreading the wait whilst it was being read by the examiners, I decided to spend the Christmas break with my father in Vienna. We had pleasant evenings together in the theatres, in the two opera houses and in a wine-and-dine taverns in Grinzing. During the days, I kept roving through the antique shops. Eventually, I found the type of item I had been looking for: a cabinet cup and saucer, with excellent paintings of Schloß Schönbrunn. It bore the Habsburg Shield and an incised number showing that it had been produced in 1804. The colours, though, were still as fresh as when the pieces had come out of the kiln.\nTwo days later, I was on my way back to London. The Registry at Oxford had sent me an urgent letter, advising that my oral examination, known as the ‘viva’, had been set for January 12. The neatly packed cabinet vase was in my briefcase, placed carefully under my seat at the back of the aeroplane.\nWhen the examination was over, I got ready to leave England. The friendly expression on my examiners’ faces had been reassuring. After taking my leave from my supervisors, I proceeded to London to express my thanks to Arthur Smithies.\n“So all is well with your thesis,” he said as soon as I entered his office. “But, of course, I have been confident all along; and what are your plans now?”\n“I had been thinking of returning to Tel Aviv. But there has been an unexpected development. The University of Singapore has offered me a post in its Faculty of Law. The letter was waiting for me when I came back from Vienna.”\n“Singapore?” he said, surprised.\n“A chap who used to work in the Bodleian Law Reading Room went there last year. A few months ago he urged me to apply for a newly created Assistant Lectureship. They took so long about it that I assumed they turned me down. Then, out of the blue, came the letter with the offer.”\n“Have you accepted?”\n“I have. I thought a few years in the East would be interesting and the tropical climate ought to be good for my asthma.”\n“What a strange coincidence,” he observed after a pause. “We have been planning to ask whether you may wish to join the Bank as a cadet. I thought it best to wait until you finished your thesis.”\n“I wish I had known,” I said, crestfallen.\n“It’s alright; don’t you worry about it. Spending some time in Singapore is a good idea. I’m sure you’ll find the East fascinating. And for how long do you plan to go?”\n“They have given me a three years contract.”\n“We’ll keep our offer open for that period. And we’ll take your new experience into account when we work out the details of an arrangement, that is, if you remain interested to join us in \u0026hellip;”.\nAt that point I was, suddenly, jolted back into the real world surrounding me. A man in uniform, who had just entered the carriage, requested all passengers to have their ticket ready for inspection. Looking out of the window, I realised we had already passed Reading. Before long, the train stopped in Oxford.\n5. Surprise at the Preview For a few moments I stood undecided outside the Station. A glance at my watch told me it was 12 noon. After a brisk walk, I boarded the double Decker to Woodstock, where a shuttle bus was waiting to convey idlers and enthusiasts to the preview of the items to be sold in the auction of the estate of the late Sir Arthur Smithies.\nAs planned, I started with the porcelain. The yellow-ground cream jug looked even more attractive on the shelf of a mahogany display cabinet than in the photograph and, despite a meticulous examination, I spotted no hairline crack to its handle. It was only when I completed my inspection of the wares that it dawned on me that one item was missing. There was no trace of the cabinet cup and saucer I had brought to my late friend from Vienna. A further march around the cabinets confirmed the position. After a slight hesitation, I stopped one of the attractive attendants:\n“Excuse me; I’d like to know: are there any other porcelain pieces here?”\n“Only what you see in the cabinets” she said, surprised.\n“Is there no Vienna cup, or cup and saucer?”\nFor a few moments she skimmed quickly, professionally, through the catalogue. When she finished, she shook her head: “No; there’s no such piece.”\nWhere was my gift? I remembered vividly how pleased he had looked when he examined the cup and saucer. “It is a lovely set, Berger. I really like it. Thanks.”\nHis delight had been genuine. Why, then, did my gift not figure in the auction? Although I had never joined the ranks of his bank and had met him only once after our last conversation in his office, we had kept in touch for years. His short letters had been marked by their warmth and by his interest in my career. He had, I was confident, remained a friend to the end. Dismissing my initial nagging doubts, I concluded that Arthur Smithies would not have parted with the cup and saucer. Had they, by sheer bad luck, been broken or stolen?\nAfter some time, I turned back to the rooms and started to inspect the furniture. Once again I experienced the sensation of unreality that had overcome me on the flight to London. The rooms looked too grand, too impersonal, to have constituted a home. They created an ambience different from Arthur Smithies’ old office in Birchin Lane. Although his fine rosewood desk, the upholstered chair and the two paintings on the wall had produced gentrified airs, the general atmosphere in the room imbued relaxed comfort. There had been no trace of the grandeur that marked the rooms in his Woodstock abode.\nIn an attempt to solve the riddle, I had a close look at the paintings on the walls. Most were English hunting scenes and galleons braving stormy seas. Then, as I cast my eye on three frames mounted one above the other on a narrow wall, I froze in my steps. Sandwiched irreverently between two common hunting scenes, hung an art work I had good reason to recognise. The small abstract study in colours entitled ‘Dawn’ was singed ‘Yuan-Ming, S’ore 1981’.” I had stood by her side when she had put the finishing touches to it.\nFor a while, the world kept spinning around me. When it steadied, I had another close look at the drawing to ensure I had not experienced a mirage. A light touch of the fine rice paper with my finger tips settled any remaining doubt. I had come face to face with a work executed by Yuan Ming .\nMy friendship with young Yuan Ming and her brilliant father, the antiques dealer Tay Fang-Shuo alias Dr Alfred Cheng, M.A., Ph.D. (Cantab), is a saga of its own. I had met them by chance in 1962, when my feet led me to their shop in the heart of Singapore’s old China Town. The tasteful display of artefacts in their show window had prompted me to cross the threshold although, at that time, I had not developed an interest in Chinese antiques.\nWithin a few months I had become a close friend of the father, whose profound understanding of both Chinese and European art amazed me. I had also become Yuan Ming’s favourite uncle. I used to help her with her home work, taught her to swim and, occasionally, when Tay and his wife attended functions in their temple, took her for a drive to Johore Bahru or Kota Tinggi. Shortly after her tenth birthday, she started to frequent my office in the University, arriving by taxi straight from school. At the beginning, Tay and I were concerned for her safety. To soothe us, she promised to stop a taxi only if she knew the driver.\nIt was at about that time that I discovered Yuan Ming’s artistic talents. Even before then, I had been aware of her preoccupation with colours and of her ability to recall the very finest shades of paintings on ceramics. On one occasion, when I challenged her, she drew an exact replica of a polychrome vase I had purchased on my first visit to their shop.\nLater on, she showed me a small sketchbook with her drawings, insisting that I tell no one about it. In the event, it had taken me ten months to persuade Yuan Ming to share our secret with Tay. By then, she had developed into a skilled and imaginative young artist.\nWe remained close even after I married a local Chinese girl in 1963. For a reason I have never managed to work out, I kept my friendship with the Tays to myself. Still, my stand was right. To forestall a storm that would have followed her discovery of this friendship, I reduced my trips to Chinatown from three to two per week. In the event, no cloud appeared on the horizon during my days at the University. Then, to my dismay, I lost touch with my friends after I left Singapore in 1966.\nYears later, I stumbled into their new shop during a year I spent as Visiting Professor in the old institution, by then renamed ‘the National University of Singapore’. To my relief, our friendship had stood the test of the lengthy period of separation. Soon I was, once again, making my pilgrimage to their shop two or three times a week. Tay, alas, was looking frail and, except when we talked about art and ceramics, remained withdrawn. But, even so, I was glad to understudy him again.\nBy then, Yuan Ming, whom I recalled as a young teenager, had bloomed into an attractive self assured woman. She was just as lively and as active as my little friend used to be but had learned to hide her nerves behind a calm and dignified front. Although she was too small to be considered a beauty, she still had her big black eyes, her luscious long hair and, above all, the directness of manner that had captivated my heart in days gone bye.\nAs I had expected, she remained devoted to art. After a short spell in Cambridge, she moved to Los Angeles. By the time I rediscovered them, she had become a reasonably well known artist, shuttling between California and Singapore and spending her breaks in the PRC, where she mastered the finer details of Chinese painting.\nConceptually, her work manifested maturity. To my disappointment, though, her brushes had lost some of their original freshness: gone was her rare ability to create shapes by a skilful manipulation of the finer shades of their colours. She was, instead, using a technique involving the execution of clear lines outlining each individual subject. With the exception of occasional pieces, in which she employed her earlier skills, I thought the work of the adolescent girl had been superior to the work of the mature young artist. Undoubtedly, the latter’s stroke and handling of the brush had reached new heights; so did the composition of her drawings and paintings. All the same, something was remiss.\nYuan Ming spotted my misgivings straightaway. After a while, she came up with a suggestion.\n“You say your wife is going to spend a few weeks with her church friends in Tainan?”\n“She is; so we can go to Changi Point a few extra times; and how about a quick trip to Sydney? You’ll love Circular Quay and Balmain.”\n“I can’t leave Dad alone; not at the moment. But how about a full day painting safari? There is a lovely spot in the Bukit Timah Reserve. Why don’t I pick you up in Pandan Valley at about 6.00 o’clock on Sunday. You can manage to get up early, once upon a time, can’t you, Respected Uncle?”\n‘Dawn’ was drawn that Sunday, by a brook on the slope of a hill. Yuan Ming had used her Chinese brush, dipping it in the ink-pots and executing each stroke with a single confident movement of her hand.\nShe kept working spontaneously, without a pause, just as she used to do in the old days. Then, after what appeared to me an eon but was in reality but a short span of some thirty minutes, she nodded her head and said with satisfaction: “That’s that; let’s see what you think of it.”\nTurning my head, I took in my breath in. The liquid shapes, outlined by the colours alone, sparkled in the gentle morning sun. She had captured the very moment of dawn, with the sun emerging in the horizon, with the rays of soft light engulfing the branches of the trees and caressing the transparent water in the brook. A man and a small girl, sitting on his lap with her arm around his shoulders, were displayed in silhouette in the background. The masterfully executed drawing created an atmosphere of lightness and harmony.\n“What do you think of it?”\n“It’s beautiful; just plain beautiful” I told her. The perfection of her stroke and of the composition compensated for the one and only shortcoming of the brilliant work: the colours were not as effervescent and as imaginatively employed as in her works of days gone bye. I knew, however, that she was once again on the right track.\nTo my relief, she did not ask any questions. Having signed the sheet of rice paper, she stamped it with her ‘chop’ – the classic Chinese artist’s seal – and wrote “Dawn” in the margin.\nLater in the day, after she had rested, Yuan Ming went back to her easel. The finished work showed a middle aged man and a young woman, admiring a small brook fermenting in the hot sun. In the background, a girl in her early teens and a young man were smiling at them.\n“Yuan Ming” I begged; “please, let me have it. I know what you are telling us.”\n“It’s yours” she affirmed with a smile; “shall I name it ‘Ablaze at Noon’?”\n“Of course” I assured her; “an is it part of set?”\n“It’s meant to be; but I’m too tired to draw the other two today; they are ‘Dusk’ and ‘Stormy Night’. I’ll have a go next week.”\nYuan Ming displayed the full set in her next exhibition in Los Angeles. She placed a ‘sold’ tag on ‘Ablaze at Noon’. ‘Dusk’ and ‘Stormy Night’ were snapped up by a New York art dealer. ‘Dawn’ was purchased by an Englishman, described by Yuan Ming as a ‘real cute gentleman, mildly spoken, conservatively dressed and not at all stuffy: a kindly sort of fellow with a twinkle in his eye.’\nSo ‘Dawn’ had been acquired by Arthur Smithies. He was an art connoisseur. But, then, why was this masterpiece hanging on this ridiculous wall, sandwiched between two dull oils? Trying hard to hide my wrath, I proceeded resolutely to the shuttle bus.\nBack in the hotel, I dropped on the bed for a nap before dinner. When I woke up, the room was pitch dark: I had slept some six hours. Realising Yuan Ming was waiting, I grabbed the receiver:\n“I’ve been waiting for your call. You alright, Uncle? Where have you been?”\n“Asleep on the bed; I just dozed off when I came back from Woodstock.”\n“Dozed off with all your clothes on?”\n“Well, yes. Sorry to have given you a fright.”\n“Something wrong?” she asked anxiously.\n“No” I told her; “but the house in Woodstock is upsetting.”\n“Let’s hear about it.”\nSuppressing my discovery of ‘Dawn’, I dwelt on the missing cup and saucer and the incongruity of the rooms.\n“So you think this was not Arthur Smithies’ type of house?”\n“It wasn’t; and he wouldn’t have parted with my gift.”\n“But people change.”\n“I know; but I didn’t think it would happen to him. Still, I suppose I am making too much of it: a storm in a tea cup.”\n“I wouldn’t say that; but is this all, Uncle?”\n“Well \u0026hellip; just about it,” I prevaricated. “But look, when will you be here?”\n“Soon; I’ll call your when I’m in Chelsea” she replied, referring to a flat she had acquired some five years earlier on.\n6. Reunion Next morning I put in my appearance in Bill Riggs’ office. As expected, neither camp had assumed the courage to cross swords with its own fighting cock. Disgusted, I spent the day polishing up my Expert’s Report, incorporating in it references to yet another bundle of documents that had materialised from nowhere. When I finished, I took a train to Knightsbridge, to make some purchases. After dinner, I prepared myself for the meeting with Counsel.\nThis meeting took almost the entire day. When it was over, I went back to the hotel. A voice message conveyed that Yuan Ming had arrived in her flat. She had taken the long flight from Los Angeles in her stride. Her smile greeted me when I entered the restaurant, in which she had booked a table. Having placed our orders, she enquired about my case. I, in turn, was eager to hear about the details of her forthcoming exhibition. Relieved to hear that everything was in place, I proceeded to ask about her personal life. To my dismay, it turned out that she and her latest boyfriend had split.\nInstantly, I felt a pang – not the reaction of a suitor, but the quiet ache of a father, who fears that his daughter may grow old and alone after he’s gone. I then concluded that Yuan Ming was still dreaming about a perfect spouse. A dependable, considerate and charming man, who would give her interests a higher priority than his own: an ideal man and perfect spouse. I suspected such paragons of virtue could be found in literature but not in real life. Still, Tay and I had persuaded young Yuan Ming that art did not tolerate compromises. She sought to apply the same unbending yardstick to her personal life.\nIt seemed best to change the subject. For a while, we recalled anecdotes of the old days in China Town. We then discussed my forthcoming appearance as Expert Witness and, eventually, turned back to her imminent exhibition.\n“So everything is alright now” I concluded.\n“With my exhibition – yes, Uncle, it is. But I do want to know what went wrong when you went to Woodstock; I know there is something you’re hiding from me. So why not tell me? It’s something you saw in that silly house – isn’t that so, Uncle?”\n“There is something; but, please, please, let me tell you later.”\n“When?”\n“After your exhibition!”\n“After my exhibition? But I’m coming with you to the next preview in Woodstock; so I’ll sure see for myself. So why not tell me now?”\nShe was, of course, right. My design of steering her away from the undignified wall was now bound to fail; perhaps it had been unsound at its inception. Without waiting for my reply, she sped on: “I thought it had something to do with the house; so I went through that silly catalogue of yours till I got a splitting headache. But I couldn’t find a thing. And look here, Uncle; I don’t see how furniture or ceramics can have anything to do with me. So it must be a drawing.”\n“So that’s it,” she said when she had taken in the change in my expression. “You came across one of my drawings. But what’s so terrible about that?”\n“It’s they way they treated it” I said bitterly, and without further prompting told her what had taken place in the preview, keeping from her only that the painting was ‘Dawn’.\n“Uncle,” she said when I had finished, “don’t you see you are being unreasonable?”\n“Unreasonable?” I spluttered angrily. “They placed your work of art between two ludicrous 19th century paintings, executed by a Philistine of an unskilled amateur.”\n“But who arranged the preview items?”\n“Some nincompoop!”\n“So that’s it, Uncle. Somebody insulted your Yuan Ming by keeping her work in the shadow. Somebody you don’t even know. And off you go, hitting the roof.”\n“I did not hit the roof! I remained as cool as cucumber.”\n“With flashing eyes? I can just imagine the scene. Remind me to have a good look at the cucumbers when we next shop in Harrods’ Food Stalls!”\n“They don’t sell them there,” I said weakly. “But, honestly, I don’t see how you can take this bullshit so calmly.”\n\u0026ldquo;But, Uncle, if you had kept your cool, you could have offered them more than the upper estimate and walked away with it.”\n“It never occurred to me.”\n“No, you were too angry, Uncle. And to think that Dad and I tried to teach you to take things easy! But, it doesn’t matter. Only next time don’t you hide things from me and don’t give me a fright.”\n7. A Rising Young Banker Back in my hotel room, my mind reverted to my days as a research student. Banking practice entailed field research, which drove me to London. Notwithstanding its high academic profile, Oxford had never become a commercial centre. Further, some books were not available there.\nIn all my spells n Lodon, a call on the building in Birchin Lane was imperative. Indeed, the walk from the Middle Temple Library, which housed the best American law books collection in Britain, to Birchin Lane became a pilgrimage. Usually, my object was to call on Sir Arthur Smithies. But yet another friendship – with Brian Davies – was in the making.\nInitially, it was a formal acquaintanceship. True, I knew that, like myself, Brian was interested in art. We talked about famous painters and draftsmen when he led me to Arthur Smithies’ office or to the adjacent waiting room. I knew, further, that Arthur Smithies trusted Brian Davies implicitly. All the same, he was in my eyes an appendage – something in the nature of a personal assistant or of body guard – to Arthur Smithies, the head of Crawfords.\nThis impersonal link turned into a much closer relationship after I ran into him one day over lunch. I was looking for a table in Lyons Corner House when Brian Davies – who had spotted me before my eye fell on him – asked me to join his table. He was lunching with a plain looking and conservatively dressed girl, a few years younger than himself.\nFollowing the introduction, Ruth Brown observed that Brian had told her a lot about me. From the brief exchange that followed, I gathered that Ruth was aware of my background and that Brian had referred to my research topic as well as to my interest in porcelain and in prints.\n“A largely academic interest at this stage,” I confided. “Good pieces are well beyond my reach.”\n“But I’m sure the right day will come,” she responded. “And, like Brian, you are getting ready for it.”\nWe went on chatting. Ruth, I realised, was not the flamboyant type of girl a man would date in anticipation of a good time or a casual affair. She was a homely girl with a traditional outlook on life. Her strength was in her character. She had the makings of a steady wife and a good mother. She would be proud to look after her husband, to bring up a solid family and to run a good home.\n“Where have the two of you met?” I took the courage to ask.\n“In a Christmas party given by Crawfords,” she told me willingly. “One of the secretaries asked me over.”\nRuth was curious about my background. She wanted to find out as much as possible about Israel and, in particular, about Jerusalem. To my relief, she did not ask any personal questions. I, too, steered carefully. Ruth, though, was forthcoming. She told me that her father was the foreman of small industrial firm, that she had two brothers and two sisters and that the family home was on the outskirts of greater London. It took her more than an hour to commute to the city, where she was employed as a teller in a local bank. In contrast to her, Brian did not volunteer any information about his own background. Still, from a casual observation I gathered he shared a flat in Marble Arch with some friends.\nI saw more of Brian and Ruth in the course of the ensuing months. Occasionally we lunched together in one of the inexpensive eateries in the City. Some other times we had afternoon tea together. Usually, Brian led the conversation to art. His interest was mainly in modern prints of French based artists. He disliked the German expressionist I admired and found ceramics uninspiring. Ruth, invariably, kept out of the conversations but did her best to feign interest. She came to life when the three of us went to a matinee or an early evening show in Piccadilly.\nI had no doubt these two would get married before long. They would – I sensed – enjoy a happy marriage and bring up a large family. What baffled me was that they kept postponing their day. Did one of the families raise objections?\nThe real reason for the waiting period emerged one day, when I spotted them in a Wimpy Bar in Holborn. To my surprise, both looked out of countenance. Brian tried to clear his expression as soon as he spotted me but Ruth remained overtly distressed. Initially, I thought it best to ignore the clouds and appear at ease. But I had come to know them too well to prevaricate.\n“Is something the matter?” I asked.\n“Not really” said Brian, whilst Ruth’s face remained set. “We have been making our plans for the future but always come up against a snag.”\n“What is it?”\n“We want to have a place of our own,” Ruth came to life. “But we can’t afford something suitable and comfy! We have enough for a nice house way out London or some crummy property closer to the City.”\n“A Hobson’s Choice,” agreed Brian. “I hate the idea of commuting – wasting some two or three hours on the train day in and day out; and I know all about lousy accommodation!”\n“I understand,” I pressed on. “But look, you’re Arthur Smithies right hand man. Can’t you …”\n“ … I’ve been telling Brian to have a chat with him,” interposed Ruth.\n“But Crawfords does not grant housing loans. Arthur Smithies might make an exception, but he won’t think the better of me,” Brian had spoken firmly.\n“But couldn’t he introduce you to a building society?”\n“We can approach one of them directly,” explained Brian; “but, Peter, we don’t have enough for a deposit.”\nThe subject of housing continued to crop up in many later conversations. In the end, Fortuna came to their aid. One of Brian’s colleagues was granted a fellowship by an American University. He asked Brian and Ruth to take care of his flat in Bayswater during the two years he planned to spend overseas. This enabled them to tie the knot. I was one of the few guests invited to their modest ceremony. Another guest was Sir Arthur Smithies.\nThe memory of that delightful occasion remained fresh in my mind over the years. Stretched comfortably on my bed in the hotel following my evening with Yuan Ming, I kept meandering about what I knew of Brian’s later career. I had been out of touch with him for a long time. But the snippets that had trickled through, suggested he had done well.\n8. ‘Dawn’ and Mr Smithies Next morning I called on Bill Riggs in order to discuss some aspects of our case. Just before lunch I went over to Chelsea. This time we proceeded to Soho, to a restaurant in the heart of Chinatown. For a while we talked about Yuan Ming’s flat in Katong. I had been looking after it since my return to Singapore. When we were done, Yuan Ming reverted to the forthcoming auction in Woodstock.\n“Uncle, my drawing in Woodstock – is it ‘Dawn’?\u0026rdquo;\n“Well \u0026hellip; yes, it is. I was going to tell you on the way to the preview.”\n“No wonder you imploded; you loved it and wanted to have it.”\n“I did; still do: but you have to exhibit and sell your best pieces.”\n“Yes, I know.” Opening her sketchbook, she went on: “Is this Arthur Smithies?”\nIt was an excellent portrait of my late friend. Looking older than when I had seen him last, in the Athenaeum, he appeared slightly stooped and his shoulders sagged more pronouncedly than I recalled. What impressed me most, though, was his expression. Although it registered his usual composure and benevolence, Yuan Ming’s sketch brought to the front an aura of independence verging on lonesomeness. She had portrayed a self-assured man, whose pride saved him from any manifestation – perhaps even the inner admission – of failure. He appeared too proud, too constant, to feel sorry for himself or to become disenchanted with life; but his face reflected no inner happiness.\n“It’s him alright” I told her. “But it’s not the way I saw him.”\n“Where do we differ?”\n“First, I thought there was something grand about him; you don’t display this. Secondly, I didn’t sense his loneliness, although I recognised that he was very much his own man.”\n“You knew him when he was considerably younger and, I suspect, when he was at his peak. I, Uncle, saw an aging man, determined to retain his self-assurance and dignity. I think you told me that his bank was taken over by an American multinational; perhaps this brought his heyday to an end.”\n“And there is one other point,” I told her. “You sketched a confirmed old bachelor. I used to think he had a wife and children. The biography in the catalogue came as a surprise!”\n“What on earth made you think he was married, Uncle? I knew he was single.”\n“To start with, something in his mannerism projected the airs of a family man. And, in any event, a dependable and warm hearted man like him was bound to attract women who wanted to set up a steady home and enjoy a good family life.”\n“I spotted the latter element; not the former. But, of course, not every man who attracts women gets hooked. And, Uncle, you saw him in his bank, which he must have treated as his family. No wonder you confused the issues. But, then, did he ever mention a wife or family?”\n“Coming to think of it, he didn’t. All I knew was that, in those days, he lived in Mayfair. I had assumed that he was too reserved to talk about his personal life.”\n“Perhaps this was what he wanted you to think! No, Uncle, the element of self-sufficiency, of loneliness, portrayed in my sketch told its own tale. I knew he was a nice and kindly man; but he wasn’t prepared to give up one single shred of his personal freedom.”\n“Did anything he say reinforce your conclusion?”\n“Not what he said, but what he didn’t say. Most men who buy a piece tell me their wife would love it or that it’s just what she wants for their sitting room. Some even say they’ll come back to have a second look with ‘the missis’; others talk about their daughter or son, and tell me proudly how talented they are and how they, too, like to draw; but not Arthur Smithies. He spoke like an art critic or a connoisseur. He understood what I was trying to do; and he appreciated it; but he remained detached. So I knew.”\n“Please, tell me all about your encounter with Arthur Smithies.”\n“He turned up on the last day of the exhibition, in the late afternoon. I suspect he didn’t plan to visit us but dropped in by chance. He stopped at the entrance like someone who hadn’t made up his mind; for a while he looked around him and only then stepped in. Most viewers were already gone, so I watched him. You see, Uncle, we don’t get many patrons from Britain; and so I was intrigued.”\n“What did you do?”\n“I kept watching him. He was not impressed with the mainstream of my works. But he showed interest when he looked at the other paintings, where I used ‘her’ old technique. When he reached the set we drew in the Bukit Timah Reserve, his expression changed altogether: it became animated and, Uncle, he broke into an appreciative smile. He moved closer to see the title of the drawings, took a few steps back to look at each drawing from a distance, came closer again and then turned around like somebody requiring attention. So I walked over and asked if I could help him.”\n“Did you tell him you were the artist?”\n“No, I didn’t; but he knew straight away; don’t ask me how. He first asked where I had drawn these pieces. He then raised questions about the technique and, very discreetly, inquired where I got my training. He was not surprised when I told him I used a Chinese technique but Western concepts. I suspect he had worked that out for himself.”\n“How do you know he grasped the subjects and the ideas behind them?”\n“I asked if he wanted me to explain. He said he thought he understood what I was aiming at and, rather shyly, ran through the four drawings and said he would like to get any piece still available.”\n“So what did you do?”\n“I told him that ‘Dawn’ was available. He jumped at it and – you know – declined the 15% discount I offered him.”\nSo Arthur Smithies had not changed his benign life philosophy. Even years after he became my mentor, he was willing to spend time or money on what appeared supportable in his eyes.\n“Did he contact you again?”\n“He did. First I got a Christmas card, in which he told me ‘Dawn’ graced his sitting room. A few months later, he sent me a handwritten note, saying that a well known London art critic had seen ‘Dawn’ and thought well of it. A Christmas card, which he sent two years later, mentioned that ‘Dawn’ was admired in an exclusive show of contemporary art.”\n“Did you reply?”\n“He never gave an address; so I assumed he intended to keep it a one way correspondence. But, Uncle, that show had an effect on my career! You remember I told you I had been invited to send drawings and sketches to a well known gallery in Paris and to another in Amsterdam?”\n“Of course.”\n“Well, the owners of the two galleries got interested in my work when they saw ‘Dawn’.”\nSo cause and effect had played their role. Still, chance – my beloved Fortuna – had directed Arthur Smithies’ feet to the exhibition in Los Angeles. Without her intervention, ‘Dawn’ may have remained unrecognised. Yet another fine painting ignored by collectors.\n“Was ‘Dawn’ his first preference?”\n“He said so. When I asked ‘why’, he answered: ‘I admire the harmony in the composition and the blending of the scenery with the dreams of the little girl and the man’s aspirations for her.’ I had the feeling, Uncle, that, for just a moment, he lost his detachment and, perhaps, was talking to himself. But look, Uncle, I must really go ahead with that call to Hong Kong. Why don’t you order our meal while I make it?\u0026quot;\nYuan Ming used her handphone. At first she spoke in Cantonese but soon switched to Mandarin. I concluded that she was negotiating with two parties: a Hong Kong businessman and a Mainland Chinese, who came to the Colony to clinch the deal. Instantly, I felt my usual apprehension for her safety. Would the pitcher go to the well once to often?\nTo calm my nerves, I tried to concentrate on Yuan Ming’s sketch of Arthur Smithies. A closer scrutiny convinced me that it was satirical. She had contrasted his declining physique with his urge to maintain the pose of days past.\nLike all her other portraits, Yuan Ming’s sketch of Arthur Smithies reflected her wit and objectivity. It was not malicious. My image of him differed because I had hero worshipped him. My tinted glasses had obliterated the dents in Arthur Smithies’ armour – the flaws that had been discerned by Yuan Ming’s impartial eye.\nHer diagnosis of Arthur Smithies in his later years was borne out by what I had gleaned from other sources. My own communications with him, following my departure from England, had been too tenuous to enable me to form a clear impression. All I knew was that he had retained his elegant style of writing and his sharp but constructive critical facility. I knew also that he had remained well inclined toward me. That much transpired from our correspondence. But his letters and occasional cards told me little about his own life and plans.\nFixing my eyes on Yuan Ming’s sketch, I asked myself whether Arthur Smithies had always been as she saw him or whether a subtle change, produced by the ravages of time, had turned the man I knew into the replica portrayed by her? Seeking to find an answer, I commenced to rove through our communications following my departure from England.\nShortly after my arrival in Singapore I had sent him a number of postcards with scenes of the town. He, in turn, kept sending me cuttings from catalogues. Later on, during my second year in Singapore, I wrote to advise him that I had decided to remain in academia. Quite apart from the liking I had developed for my new abode and its mild tropical climate, I had by then cemented my friendship with Tay and Yuan Ming. I was too happy to yearn for a career in grey and eternally drizzling London. He sent me a charming reply, using the occasion to attach some comments on an article I had published in an English periodical.\nToward the end of the same year, I went for a short spell to Vienna and for just one week to London. Naturally, I went down to Crawford \u0026amp; Co but, to my disappointment, Arthur Smithies was out of town. Brian Davies, too, was unavailable.\nI made my next attempt to see him during my study leave. A fortnight after our arrival in London. I was about to enter the building n Birchin Lane when, to my amazement, I saw that the old and elegant placard had been replaced by the insignia of the First National City Trust Co. Inc., a well known American multinational bank. For a while I stared at it dumbfounded. Then, hidden beneath the large letters of the new owners’ name, I spotted a small brass table. It read: ‘Formerly Crawford \u0026amp; Co. – founded 1756.’\nWhen I recovered, I stepped in. The new Head Porter, who used to be the second in command, recognised me instantly.\n“We haven’t seen you here for a while, Sir.”\n“I’ve been away, in Singapore. Congratulations on your promotion.”\n“Thank you, Sir; thank you. You look well, if I may say so. Must be nice and warm out there in the East.”\n“It is indeed. But tell me please, is Mr Smithies available?”\n“I am afraid he is no longer with us, Sir.”\n“Do you know whether he is in London?”\n“I believe he is in Scotland. Mr Brian Davies may have his address.”\n“Is he still with the bank?”\n“He is indeed. Shall I let him know you are here?”\nBrian Davies had put on weight and projected the image of a successful executive on his way up. After a drink in his office, we went for lunch. Over the first course, we exchanged our personal news. I was delighted to learn that Brian had been appointed the Head of the Overseas Department – a fine achievement for a man in his mid thirties. Brian, though, did not tell me much about his post. He was, rather, eager to talk about his domestic life.\n“Mary Jane arrived over two years ago,” he said proudly. “She talks quite a bit already. And we are told our next one will be a boy. He is due soon.”\n“Congratulations,” I said warmly; “do you intend to have a large family?”\n“Jonathan will have to be the last; Ruth is having a tough time. I wish we were living closer to the City so that I could go home for lunch.”\n“I thought you had intended to buy a house in Bayswater when your landlord came back from the States?”\n“We still couldn’t afford a good house in inner London; so we settled on a house in Stanmore.”\n“Where exactly is Stanmore?”\n“I keep forgetting you are not from these pArt, Peter,” he chuckled. “Stanmore is on the outskirts, just within greater London. Forty minutes by train.”\n“That’s a long ride.”\n“Some of my colleagues commute from as far as Oxford!”\nAs before, Brian enjoyed his food. Still, when the waiter had served the main course, Brian turned, at long last, to the subject I was most interested in.\n“You must wonder what has happened to the old bank? Did Arthur Smithies tell you about the takeover?”\n“I received his last letter about half a year ago; and ‘no’, he didn’t say anything about a takeover.”\n“They were still negotiating at that time; I suspect he thought the deal would fall through.”\n“What actually happened?”\n“You could call it a ‘palace revolution’, although a ‘family skirmish’ is more to the point.”\n“I am not sure I understand.”\n“You knew that Crawford \u0026amp; Co. was a partnership, didn’t you?” Without waiting for my reply, he went on. “Arthur Smithies had the biggest share. All the other partners were members of the two families: the Smithies and the Crawfords. Well, some of them started to get concerned about the drop in profits.”\n“I thought the bank was doing well?”\n“In some ways it did. New clients from Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands were investing their funds with us. This, incidentally, was why Arthur Smithies was keen to have you join us: he needed somebody to handle our German speaking clientele. Still, at the other end of the scale, we were losing some of our older clients, like Timberflashings. Crawfords was too small to stem the onslaught of some of the foreign banks. Arthur Smithies’ idea of gradually transforming the firm into an investment bank was sound: the private investor’s first two priorities are ‘the personal touch’ and confidentiality. Here the multinationals cannot compete with the small aristocratic banks.”\n“So what went wrong?”\n“The family partners became too impatient; and too greedy. All they saw was the periodic fall in profits. Some asked Arthur Smithies to buy them out but, of course, demanded too much. When he refused, one of them approached First National. It was common knowledge that they were looking for a target in London and, as expected, they jumped at the opportunity. Initially, Arthur Smithies sought to fend them off. Regrettably, some family partners tried to use the take-over bid as a club to beat a better price for their holdings out of Arthur Smithies.”\n“He would not have appreciated that!” said I.\n“He hated it! Some eighteen years ago, when Crawfords went through a post War crisis, Arthur Smithies gave up his practice at the Bar and took over the management of the Bank. He salvaged it. I am told that nobody said: ‘thank you’. This may not have mattered to him then; perhaps he didn’t expect a show of gratitude. But he took a dim view of the family’s conduct during the last few years. In the end, he made his own deal with our new masters. Being an honest man he looked also after the interests of the rest: but he made his own decision and put the remaining partners before a fait accompli.”\n“How did they take it?”\n“With varying degrees of ill grace. Although Arthur Smithies secured a fair deal, they felt slighted because he had not consulted them. I believe their resentment was the real cause of an ugly scene, made by the son of one of one partners and the daughter of another.”\n“What happened?”\n“The two – who I think are engaged to be married – turned up one morning. The young man, who was in a foul mood, started by voicing his unhappiness with the deal and then accused Arthur Smithies of making an unfair profit out of it. You see, Arthur Smithies bargained for a termination bonus based on the loss of the salary paid to him as the bank’s managing partner. The young man argued that this sum was taken out of the price payable for the assets so that its payment reduced the amount due to each partner for his share.”\n“What did Arthur Smithies say?”\n“I could see he was taken aback. But, even so, he tried to explain to them that it was a severance payment, to remunerate him for his years of service to the bank – a golden handshake. I believe the girl accepted this. She must have realised how deeply Arthur Smithies had been offended and wanted to avoid a family quarrel. Unfortunately, the young man wouldn’t be silenced. He told Arthur Smithies that he had taken legal advice and, on its basis, was satisfied that the payment was in the nature of a bribe! He concluded by saying: ‘This is not something the family expected from you, our upright uncle Arthur!’.”\n“The bloody cheek! What did Arthur Smithies do?”\n“You should have seen his face. For just a moment I feared he would lose his temper and yell at them. Then, within a matter of seconds, he managed to control himself and just kept staring at them in silence. When he had cooled down, he said in a measured tone: ‘As you have already consulted your legal advisers, the matter has to be settled through them. I shall refer their letter to my own solicitors. And now I have to get ready for my next appointment; so please excuse me. Mr Davies will show you out’.”\n“You must have felt very awkward to be in the middle?”\n“I was too absorbed in what was going on to think of myself.”\n“And so did you just see them out?”\n“Not immediately. The girl said they were only repeating the lawyer’s opinion. Arthur Smithies did not bother to reply. Then the young man asked if there was any message for his father. Arthur Smithies replied: ‘So he is a party to this affront. Very well, then. You can tell him that I shall sign the take-over agreement on the appointed day. Under clause 17, the agreement comes into operation only if it is signed by all the partners within the immediately following ten days. If they do not sign, I shall take the necessary steps to dissolve the partnership. And now I must really ask you to leave.’ The young man said: ‘As you wish.’ The girl tried again to salvage the situation. She mentioned the high esteem in which Arthur Smithies was held by the family and said he had always been her favourite uncle. When she finished, Arthur Smithies said: ‘What a pity it has all come to end in this way.’ He then picked up the file lying in front of him and immersed himself in it. They then left.”\n“Was there a sequel?” I wanted to know.\n“Not that I know of. By the end of the ten days period, all the partners had signed on the dotted line.”\n“What I can’t understand is how any responsible solicitor could tell his client that a ‘golden handshake’ constituted a bribe? That young ass must have consulted an octogenarian!”\n“No, Peter: he consulted a law student!” Noting my amazement, Brian Davies went on: “When I saw them out of the building the girl chided her fiancé for his rudeness. He had been asked to reason with uncle Arthur, with the object of convincing him to pay a percentage of his ‘golden handshake’ over to the family. Nobody had asked him to stage a confrontation. Well, her words cut no ice with that chap. Appearing quite unruffled, he told her that he was certain a ‘nice old stick’ like their worthy uncle Arthur would do the right thing after thinking the matter over. He would be scared by the damage to his ‘bloody reputation’. She retorted that uncle Arthur hadn’t looked frightened to her. She then scolded the young man for alleging they had consulted a lawyer, when all he did was to discuss the matter with a law student in Cambridge. The young man muttered he still thought Arthur Smithies would cave in; to which she replied: ‘We’ll see’.”\n“And they had this row in front of you, Brian?”\n“Quite so. You see, Peter, these young rich upstArt, with their arrogance and bloody airs, regard somebody in my position as a sort of a butler. So they take no notice of my presence. Still, I didn’t repeat what I had heard to Arthur Smithies: he would not have wanted to know and, in any event, it would have made no difference. He had decided to sever his ties with the family there and then; and I don’t blame him.”\n“What happened to Arthur Smithies after the completion of the take-over. The porter told me he was in Scotland.”\n“He declined an offer for a non-executive directorship of First National but considered an offer to join another bank – an emerging investment bank with a background similar to Crawfords’.” He hesitated for a moment and then added, slightly embarrassed: “I think you can guess who they are. Then came the offer to put him in charge of the restructuring of CBC Corporation\u0026hellip;”\n“Who are they?”\n“A substantial industrial firm; the main shareholder is the Crown. About one year ago the Annual General Meeting resolved to relocate the headquarters to Edinburgh. Arthur Smithies appeared the right man to be put in charge. He considered the proposition for a fortnight and accepted. I suspect he wanted to be away for a period.”\n“Did he look after the interests of his old employees?” I asked, wondering what would have been my fate had I joined Crawford \u0026amp; Co.\n“He did us proud! You realise all of us had been handpicked by him. He knew some would not fit in with the new management. So he interviewed each employee to see if he wanted to remain in the bank or preferred to make a move. Quite a few of the old guard got excellent jobs in other banks in the City through him. I could have moved to Brownlows but decided to stay put. If you had joined us, he would have secured you an opening in one of the established foreign investment banks.”\n“So, by and large, it was a painless take-over.”\n“For everybody, except, I think, for Arthur Smithies himself,” concluded Brian Davies.\nA few days after that lunch with Brian Davies, I wrote to Arthur Smithies at his new address in Edinburgh. We exchanged letters periodically during my ten years in New Zealand but, to my regret, never managed to meet.\nMy impressions of Arthur Smithies’ Odyssey during these years were, in consequence, based entirely on his letters and postcards. Unlike mine, which provided an outline of my life and career, his communiqués told me little about himself. Usually he started by commenting on the latest offprint of an article I had sent him or expressed his thanks for the copy of a new book. Frequently, he included an appendix with comments and notes and, occasionally, incorporated observations respecting banking practice.\nHe also used to refer to interesting auctions or exhibitions he had attended or to his main news as, for instance, that he had completed his assignment in Edinburgh and was pleased to be back in London. But, even on this specific occasion, he did not furnish any details respecting the work he had carried out.\nShortly after his return to London, he wrote that he had moved from Mayfair to Epping, where he had found a house suitable for his ever growing collection of furniture and artefacts. A few months later, I was delighted to read that he had been constituted the Chairman of the Board of Directors of a major public corporation. He savoured the prestige involved but, all the same, regretted that the new position did not engender the process of decision making to which he had been accustomed at Crawford \u0026amp; Co. “Occasionally,” he wrote “I miss the hurly-burly.”\nLater still – a few weeks after we had missed one another in 1974 – he told me he had resigned his appointment in that public corporation and set himself up as an arbitrator in commercial disputes. A passage in the relevant letter was revealing. “My room in my old chambers in the Middle Temple has once again become my headquarters. I am glad I have kept it all these years.” After a further few years, when I was already back in Singapore, he told me had decided to retire, explaining: “A sensible boxer knows when to quit the ring.”\nAs my mind skimmed through the letters we had exchanged over the years, it dawned on me that, in more than one way, they had remained formal. I continued to address him as “Dear Mr Smithies” (or ‘Sir Arthur’) whilst his letters opened with “My Dear Berger”. Neither of us had ever referred in our correspondence to the mishaps, to the disappointments and to the occasional upheavals that close friends discuss with one another. He had, for instance, not referred to his split with the rest of his family. I, in turn, had never adverted to my matrimonial problems.\nWe had also been careful in commenting on each other’s personal decisions. I recalled that, when I advised him of my appointment to the Chair in Wellington, he had observed: “I only hope you will be able to pursue your interest in porcelain from out there.” Notably, the very same letter included one of the only two comments he had ever made about my personal life. “From all I hear,” he had written, “Wellington is a nice place; hopefully your wife, who is accustomed to life in a hustling and bustling town like Singapore, will find it congenial.” The other comment, written when I told him I had been appointed to a Chair at Monash University in Melbourne, went in the same direction: “I am sure you will find a larger University a new challenge. Your wife, I trust, is looking forward to life in a large town like Melbourne.” He had been less direct when I told him, a few years later, that we had decided to return to Singapore. Having expressed his warm congratulations on my new appointment, he added: “So you have decided to settle in your wife’s old home town”.\nAs Yuan Ming kept discussing her forthcoming deal with the overseas parties, I continued to reflect on my correspondence with Arthur Smithies. Then, just as she ended the call, the waiter placed the meal I had ordered in front of us. They chef had taken his time but, then, the dishes were freshly cooked.\n“And you were thinking of Arthur Smithies whilst poor me was busy negotiating the grand deal,” she said with a twinkle in her eye.\n“I have indeed; and I like your sketch.”\n“Thanks; but you better snap back into the present; or I’ll gobble up all the food: I’m as hungry as a horse!”\n\u0026ldquo;As a mare, surely?\u0026rdquo;\n“Sure, Uncle, sure,” she burst out laughing; “when you get fed up with the law, you may devote yourself to teaching bright school children the sequence of tenses, the declination of verbs and ancient grammar.”\n“All right,” I replied. “And so your deal is all settled?”\n“We’ll see; I’ll know for sure tomorrow. And I may not have to go to China after all. They’ve sent some pieces over here and I’m going to examine them tomorrow morning. If they are O.K., I can clinch the deal from London and make the final arrangements from Hong Kong.”\n9. A Grand Deal Next morning I took the underground to Bank Station. When I embarked at the Lombard Street exit, I was overcome by an urge to walk over to Birchin Lane. A glance at the front of the well known building revealed that it had changed hands again. It now housed the Administration and Finance Section of a major British bank. I was about to turn back on my heels, when I heard a voice addressing me: “Can I help you, Sir?”\nHe, too, had aged. Streaks of salt and pepper interlaced his previously light hair and his face was wrinkled all over. But his ruddy appearance and his army bearing continued to give him an aura of robustness.\n“It is a long time since you called last, Sir.”\n“Some twenty years or so. And how have you been keeping?”\n“Can’t complain, Sir, can’t complain; and how are you? You look well, if I may say so.”\n“Thank you” I said. “And I see the old building has new owners.”\n“They bought it some five years ago. It became too small for First National.”\n“The premises are no longer sort of open to customers.”\n“No, they aren’t; but would you like to have a look?”\nAs I followed him, I noticed that his right knee was stiff. Despite his effort to hide his impediment, he was limping.\n“A touch of the gout,” he said without bitterness. “Knee is painful in the morning but gets better later in the day.”\n“Are you undergoing treatment?”\n“Not really; it’ll come right sooner or later,” he answered as he let me in.\nThe well was gone. So was the elegant mezzanine floor. Rows of small cubby box offices, set apart by thin partitions, occupied what had once been a spacious interior. Even the staircase looked narrower and the modernised lifts lacked in charm.\n“I think I have seen enough. But tell me, the old board room – is it still the same?”\n“The room is still there; but I am afraid the panelling is gone. The polishing process became too expensive, what with the cost of flying the workmen over from Italy. So First National had it stripped off. The new pine panelling looks just as good but doesn’t have the cool touch.”\n“What a pity” I said as he closed the door behind us. “And tell me, is Mr Brian Davies around?”\n“I am afraid not, Sir. He left First National years ago. I hear he went out to the Gulf to set up their banking system. But he may be back in England now. And Sir Arthur Smithies passed away last month. The poor gentleman. He made sure First National did the right thing by us.”\n“I was sorry to hear of his demise. Actually, I went to the preview of his estate earlier this week.”\n“I am going next week, Sir. I hope to get the painting of the galleon battling the storm off Yarmouth I like this painting. It used to hang in the Partners Room. It sort of reminded me of home.”\n“I think it’s there. So are you from Yarmouth?” I told him.\n“We are; and my wife is looking forward to going back when I finish here.”\n“All the best luck in the world to you then” I said, touched by his show of loyalty to his home town. “And take care of yourself \u0026hellip;”\n“ … Bates” he interceded with a grin. “Roger Bates.”\nWhen I got to Bill Rigg’s office, I discovered that the trial had been postponed because the judge had come down with a bout of ‘flu. To avoid a series of delays a new date had been set some two weeks after the vacated day. Shrugging my shoulders, I took a taxi to Chelsea.\nAs soon as I entered the flat, Yuan Ming showed me a few ceramics pieces, mainly T’ang and Song. The purchasers had demanded a second opinion. She wanted me to examine the ones in front of us. On this occasions, my work with her late father stood me in good stead. Following a careful perusal, I concluded they were genuine.\n“These pieces are perfect: best T’ang and Song items I’ve seen for years” I told her.\n“They are,” she agreed. “Once they are out of China, they’ll fetch a fortune.”\nFor a while, I kept staring at her. Strange thoughts raced through my mind. Why was she implicated in such a shady deal, involving the smuggling of a national treasure out its home country?\n“You wonder why I’m doing it?”\n“Well, yes. Shouldn’t this find remain in China, as part of the national heritage? You are not doing it just for the money, Yuan Ming?”\n“No, of course, not. I have enough; not that my 3 per cent cut is to be sneezed at. But, no, money is sure not my motive. Like the two principals, I want to help get these pieces to a safe place, where there are no political lunatics who destroy works of art out of ideological zeal. That, Uncle, is the main motive. When the dust has settled, the treasure will be bequeathed to a suitable museum. ”\n“I understand,” I assured her. “But I hope you can clinch the deal from here: if you get caught in something like this in China, I’ll never see you again.”\n“Some of the people involved are right at the top; so the risk is negligible” she said with a smile. “But you are right – it’s dangerous because they may look for a scapegoat if somebody blows the whistle. So I better try to settle it now.”\nI sat beside her as she made her call to the United States. This time she spoke in Hokkien and so I could grasp occasional phrases. Outwardly, she remained calm and her voice kept its even resonance. But I could sense the tension that was mounting inside her. As soon as she finished, she smiled at me apologetically and dialled a number in Hong Kong.\n“And so you clinched the deal?” I asked when she ended the call with a satisfied grin.\n“I have. But I had to reduce my commission to 2 per cent.”\n“But you don’t have to travel to China?!”\n“No, I don’t! And, Uncle, you can keep the pieces we examined. They are a bonus – for a long suffering uncle.”\n“They are worth at least £10,000.00; perhaps more!”\n“But you are not going to sell them, are you? I’m sure you’ll place them on the shelves of Dad’s cabinets.” She was referring to the ceramics collection, including Tay’s pieces, which we kept in the flat in Katong.\n“True” I said. “He would have liked them! Also, such works of art should not be sold to a rich ignoramus, who might smash them in a fit of rage when his next currency speculation misfires or when his latest mistress elopes with his chauffeur!”\n“What language” she laughed. “The way you talk, Uncle, I might forget you are a sedate lawyer charging resolutely for every minute of your precious time!”\n“It all goes for a good cause,” I protested.\n“Like buying extravagant gifts for your niece?”\n“Coming to think of that,” I told her, “I might as well show you what I have bought for your birthday. I’d rather give it to you now than in six days.”\n“Don’t tell me it’s another piece of jewellery!”\n“No, it isn’t: just you have a look!”\nAn animated expression crept over her face when she picked up the Harlequin. He was gracefully dancing away from the small scent bottle, shaped as the trunk of an oak, against which he had been leaning. Like me, she was captivated by the dynamic movement of his right arm and his left leg, by his beckoning hand which invited an unseen Columbine to join him and by his enigmatic smile. Although he was less than two inches tall, he had all the attributes of a rococo sculpture.\n“He is adorable” she said after a pause. “And I love his costume. Yes, Uncle, he’s cute: I’d like to dance with him!”\n“Do you like him better than the Chinese pieces you just gave me?”\n“Yes, I do” she said readily; “the porcelain is almost as good as Chinese porcelain; and the colours are just as fresh and project the same harmony\u0026hellip;”\n“Why, then, do you prefer him?”\n“Because he is a real man – with his own dreams. He talks to me and, yes, I should like to dance with him. Thanks Uncle.” Placing him caressingly beside the larger, imposing yet perfect Chinese pieces, she concluded: “Look, Uncle, he dwarves these pieces.”\n“They have their own elegance” I said with unease, thinking of her father.\n“They do; but my Harlequin is the real thing.” Looking at me searchingly, she added: “Dad, too, knew it; but was loath to admit it.”\nIt was raining hard that evening. So we ordered a pizza and prepared a few dishes. I proved my ability as a chef by baking a soufflé. Over this dinner we planned our next day trip to Woodstock and a journey to the Continent. After we had washed and dried the dishes, Yuan Ming brought up an old subject:\n“Uncle, when you first came to Dad’s shop in Chinatown, you didn’t even look for it? You just stepped in on the spur of the moment?”\n“You could say that; but I liked the tastefully arranged show window.”\n“Suppose you had walked bye with your head in the clouds; or suppose you hadn’t lost your way at all that day?”\n“Well?” said I.\n“We might have never met. What do you think would my life have been like, Uncle? Do you think I would have become an artist?”\n“And why not? You had the talent all along.”\n“But what were Dad’s plans for me?”\n“He wanted you to become a scholar like himself.”\n“But was I born to be a scholar? Did I have the desire to search for knowledge?”\n“Perhaps not; but your Dad tried to get you there.”\n“But can you change a child’s orientation altogether? Come, come, Uncle , you spent hours teaching ‘her’ to write \u0026hellip;”\n“And you always got the top marks in school for your essays!”\n“Because ‘she’ wrote them under your vigilant eye. But did she have a natural gift?”\n“Perhaps not. Still, under your Dad’s guidance you became skilled in writing Chinese!”\n“Because I loved the beauty of the script. So I worked hard to perfect my technique; and Dad was proud of me: sometime he couldn’t resist bragging. But he knew I was no scholar.”\n“Still, you could have become a great traditional Chinese artist? Even as things stand, you have been recognised by some of the best masters of China!”\n“So I have – but my work would have been sterile. Yet another Chinese artist labouring for years to perfect her stroke; and could I have produced ‘Dawn’ or ‘Ablaze at Noon’.”\n“You would not have conceived the idea; I’m not sure why.”\n“I’ll tell you why, Uncle. Someone had to draw me away from the narrow constraints of my own culture and early upbringing. ‘She’ needed somebody to assure her that she had the right to think for herself; and so you stepped into our shop; and helped ‘her’ to open her eyes!”\n“But your Dad was as much of an individualist as me. He, too, made a fetish of your independence.”\n“He did, Uncle; and he was an individualist. Still, he was plagued by a desperate need to cling to the image of a traditional Chinese scholar: detached from life, patient even if open eyed, and imperturbable.”\n“And when he delivered his sparkling lectures in English?”\n“For these he turned himself into his image of a Cambridge scholar, changing his clothes, his manner of speech and even his demeanour. But here, too, he clung to an ideal.”\n“What are you telling me, Yuan Ming?” I asked bewildered.\n“In his heart of heArt Dad remained a traditional Chinese. As you know, he understood the West and its ideals. He liked much of what the West offered him. But his core remained untouched.”\n“And you, Yuan Ming – aren’t you still a Chinese girl?”\n“In appearance only. But when all is said and done, Uncle, I am a bit like you. You, Uncle, are no longer a real Viennese or Israeli. Today, you think, speak and write in English – not in one of your two mother tongues. So you’ve become a cross cultural person \u0026hellip;”\n“A mongrel?”\n“ \u0026hellip; quite. But remember, thoroughbreds are dull; mongrels are cute.”\n“And you, Yuan Ming, what are you?”\n“In many ways, I’m still Chinese. But like you, I have travelled far away from home.”\n“But how – in which direction?”\n“I went for a search for myself: a search for individuality. This, Uncle, is the fetish of the West: the ideal which separates West from East. Even if Dad had conceived the idea of ‘Dawn’, the topic would have disturbed him. In his eyes, it would be untraditional and vulgar.”\n“He never tried to stop you,” I protested lamely.\n“True; he didn’t. He was a fair minded man. Perhaps he also realised that the old order had to give way. But he didn’t approve. No, Uncle, you had to bring out ‘her’ talents.”\nOnce again, there was a lull in our conversation. Both of us were recalling the old days affectionately. They had been happy. Seen through a kaleidoscope, the bright colours had moved into the centre.\nAfter a short lull, Yuan Ming resumed her discourse: “Let me tell you, Uncle, what my life would have been like if we hadn’t met. No doubt, ‘she’ would have taken over Dad’s shop \u0026hellip;”\n“ \u0026hellip; you did in any event.”\n“So I did,” she agreed, “and ‘she’ would have made just as good a job of it even if you hadn’t stepped into her life. ‘She’ had the ability and the business acumen. The shop would have become her career. ‘She’ would not have become a scholar: ‘she’ was too pragmatic. So your grown up Yuan Ming would have ended up as one of the leading Chinese art dealers \u0026hellip;”\n“ \u0026hellip; you are now!” I interceded firmly.\n“Now I’m one of the top twenty or so; if ‘she’ had grown up without meeting you, the sky would have been the limit! I could have been in the top three!”\n“Do you have regrets?”\n“Of course not. You see, ‘her’ dreams would have been quenched at source and I should have missed out on my real vocation. Also, I should probably be unhappily married to a successful Chinese businessman, with a degree in ‘systems engineering’ or some such other frightful subject.” Pausing for a minute, she went on: “And if I had come across my Dancing Harlequin, I should have thought he was cute; but the wish to dance with him would have never crossed my mind.”\nBack in my lonely hotel room, I kept thinking of what Yuan Ming had told me. Initially, I was disturbed by her harsh judgment of her late father. Then, as I meandered through my own experiences with him, I realised she had hit the nail on its head. In many ways, Tay’s outlook had resembled Arthur Smithies’. True, there were marked differences between the roads chosen by the two men. Tay Fang-Shou had devoted his life to the study of plastic art whilst Arthur Smithies had pursued a career in the City. Both, though, had an aesthetic drive and an admiration for creativity. They had also possessed the instincts of connoisseurs and patron of the Art. These qualities enabled the two men to recognise the merits of alien cultures. At the same time, each of them had remained engrossed in his own milieu.\nNaturally, I was aware of the demarcation between Tay and my nephews and nieces in Singapore. It was the same gap that separated Arthur Smithies from Roger Bates, the ageing porter at the building in Birchin Lane. Unlike Arthur Smithies, Roger Bates did not doubt the precepts and the norms of his strong English background. What would Roger Bate have told his pals in the pub after a visit to Paris or to Vienna? Undoubtedly, he would have described each town as quaint; and he would have had much to say about the food, the taverns and the attractive girls. His main sentiment, though, would have been: “it’s good to be back at home, where everything is just right”.\nTay and Arthur Smithies were as far removed from Roger Bates and from my tunnel-visioned nephews and nieces as Yuan Ming and I were ahead of the two of them. Unlike Tay and Arthur Smithies, Yuan Ming and I were prepared to question the very ethos of our own respective backgrounds and cultures. To us, both the idols of the home and the platitudes of the market place had lost their authority. Brian Davies, I reflected, might have travelled in the same direction but, in the event, did not take the cosmopolitan ticket.\n“Yes, Yuan Ming,” I whispered although I knew my thoughts could not be transmitted to her flat in Chelsea, “eons ago our paths had crossed due to Fortuna’s whim. But that chance meeting had its own lasting effect on both of us.”\n10. Last meeting with a friend We made our way to Woodstock in a rented car. Firm in her belief that wealth ought to be enjoyed, Yuan Ming hired a Rover. As always, she handled the car far more confidently and aggressively than myself. Frequently she took advantage of the chivalry displayed by male drivers on the road, remunerating their gallantry with an appreciative smile.\nFor a while I continued to admire the progress made by her. Then, compulsively, my mind strayed back to Arthur Smithies. Although Yuan Ming’s sketch and searching assessment of his personality had revealed the dents in his armour, I continued to recall him with my usual affection and gratitude. As Yuan Ming entered the M4, adroitly overtaking in the process another woman driver who screamed an obscenity at her, my mind focused on my very last meeting with my late friend: our conversation in the Athenaeum in 1981.\nIt had taken place during a week which I spent in London in respect of my first engagement as an expert witness. After my spell in the witness box, our QC invited me, together with a colleague from King\u0026rsquo;s College, to have lunch in the Athenaeum. Looking around me when the waiter served the main course, my glance rested for a moment on an elderly gentleman who was sitting on his own at a nearby table. By sheer coincidence he raised his head. Our eyes met and, instantaneously, I recognised him.\nHis hair had gone grey and he had lost some weight; but he did not look as frail as in Yuan Ming’s sketch. I sensed that he had retained his presence and had aged with dignity. Offering my excuses to my host, I stepped over and joined Arthur Smithies.\n“It has been a long time since we last met, Mr Smithies”.\n“Too long, Berger, far too long.”\n“And how are you keeping? You look well, if I may say so.”\n“Thank you; I do look after myself; except that I take on more cases than I ought to.”\n“Surely, you do continue to enjoy your role in the City?”\n“I suppose I do; it’s the life to which I’m accustomed; occasionally, though, I feel the need to have more time for myself: for my collection mainly. But, tell me, Berger, how are you getting on? And thanks again for the books and offprints you send me from time to time. I enjoy reading them.”\n“Thanks” I said, touched “and, actually, I’m fine. As I mentioned to you in my last letter, I’m spending one year of sabbatical leave in Singapore. My wife loves it.”\n“And has she accompanied you to London?”\n“I’m afraid not. I’ve come out for just a few days – to give evidence as an expert witness on banking practice.”\n“And how is it going?”\n“No too badly.”\n“I’m glad it’s going smoothly,” he said with approbation. “I told them you were the right man for the job when the subject cropped up in a recent conversation.”\n“I’ve wondered who had mentioned my name to Paine and Pine, Mr Smithies. It was most kind of you to think of me.”\n“Oh, I just mentioned your name; I’m sure they decided to call you in reliance on your publications.”\n“But I’m sure your support was essential, and thanks again. But please tell me, Mr Smithies, how do you find Epping? Do you commute to London every day?”\n“Not really, just about two or three times a week. When we have an arbitration going, I stay in the club. And, yes, I do like Epping. A small town with a life of its own but with easy access to the City.”\n“And how is your collection?”\n“It has grown,” he responded with a smile. “I find good furniture and pieces of porcelain irresistible. Soon my house will become too small to contain them. The rooms begin to look cluttered. And how is your collection?”\n“Getting quite substantial!” I told him proudly.\n“Which shows that both of us are hooked on collecting,” he said. Then, as if embarrassed by his joke, he added in haste: “And have a look, I just received a catalogue of a forthcoming sale of the estate of a keen collector from Torquay.”\nOpening the catalogue at the pages displaying the porcelain items, he drew my attention to the yellow milk jug.\n“Isn’t it lovely?” he asked.\n“Exquisite,” I confirmed. “You’ll bid for it, no doubt?”\n“There are a few other good pieces in the sale; but I think this is the best. Have a look for yourself.”\nFor a few moments both of us were engrossed in the Meissen pieces displayed in the catalogue. He was about to make a remark about a lovely vase, but changed his mind and said: “But I think you better rejoin your table; Bailey has just glanced in our direction.”\n“Oh, I suppose they are really discussing some other forthcoming case,” then, realising that our conversation had gone on for quite a while, I conceded resignedly, “but you are, of course, right. Still, I am delighted we have, at long last, met again.”\nGetting ready to rise and take my leave, I was overcome by profound sense of gratitude. Settling back into my chair and trying hard to control my voice, I turned back to him: “But before we part, Mr Smithies, there is just one more thing I have got to say to you. I do want to thank you for all you have done for me and for all your concern and assistance over the years. In more than one manner, you have set me on my way. I am – and will always remain – deeply grateful to you.”\nEven as I spoke, I experienced a sense unease. I had used the words of a young man at the outset of his career expressing his thanks to his teacher. Coming from myself, an academic in mid life with a sound track record, they sounded out of place. Had I made a fool of myself? My fears were allayed by the change in Arthur Smithies’ expression. It told me I had not spoken in vain and that my outburst had fallen on receptive ears. He had understood what I meant and was moved. For a few moments he remained lost for words. Then, in his usual, even, voice, he replied:\n“I think you give me too much credit, Berger. There were, of course, your supervisors in Oxford and don’t you underrate your research and perseverance. But I do appreciate what you have just said; and believe me it has always been a pleasure.”\nHe was about to add a few words in the same vein but, after a hurried glimpse at the other table, cut himself short: “Once again, thanks for what you have just told me. But I really think you ought to return to your table. Otherwise, old Bailey might conclude I’ve kidnapped his guest.”\nHaving rejoined my host, I used a lull in the conversation to glance in Arthur Smithies’ direction. Outwardly, he appeared immersed in his catalogue; but a satisfied expression brightened his face. Shortly thereafter, when I looked over again, his table was vacant; Arthur Smithies had left unobtrusively.\n11. Re-estimate “You have been in a far away country, Uncle,” said Yuan Ming as I turned back to her. “Do you always neglect your lady friends when they act as chauffeurs?”\n“Sorry,” I said contritely, “just for a moment I was thinking of \u0026hellip;”\n“Arthur Smithies” she broke in “your last encounter with him, ‘me think’!”\n“Spot on. But how did you know?”\n“I know you. And that encounter, Uncle, it took place shortly before you found Dad and me?”\n“So it did. I stumbled into your shop some ten days after I had returned to Singapore.”\n“Yes, Uncle; and you told me about that episode two or three days before we drew ‘Dawn’; it was interesting to listen to you: it confirmed that you hadn’t changed at all; just as I thought.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“You, Uncle, have always been constant in your affiliations; once you accepted a person, he could do no wrong.”\n“You are probably right” I acknowledged.\n“I believe I am; but there is something I’ve never fully understood. You see, you have always been grateful to your two supervisors and also to those of your Deans who helped you on your way. But, somehow, you felt much more deeply indebted to Arthur Smithies. It was the type of relationship you had with Dad. I think I know the reason, but why don’t you tell me.”\n“All right,” I nodded. “You see, my two supervisors and my Deans belong to one and the same world: to the Universities. Academia is an open ended society, in which able students can race ahead regardless of their background or station in life. I have benefited greatly from my two years in Oxford, have remained grateful to those who gave me their support and, in turn, have endeavoured to render the same assistance to my own gifted students and also to young colleagues. As you know, I’m proud of those who are presently overtaking me in my own field.”\n“And Arthur Smithies?” she asked.\n“He represented a different world. The aristocratic English banks are closed shops, opening their ranks mainly to young Englishmen from the right professional background. It helps if an applicant has a good University degree; but the pedigree is just as important.”\n“And you were flattered by the interest which a member of this class showed in your work and by his offer to appoint you to his staff?”\n“Yes, Yuan Ming; but it wasn’t just the assistance which he gave me and the offer. It went much deeper than that. You see, I had, really, no right to make any demands on him or on his bank. There was no social or professional norm that required him to be at my service. I was touched by his generosity.”\n“It boosted your confidence as well, didn’t it?” she probed.\n“It did indeed. It was good to know that my work was well thought of by one of London’s leading bankers, just as it was good to know later on, in Singapore, that your Dad approved of my progress in the study of Chinese porcelain. And, Yuan Ming, he too encouraged me out of sheer kindness.”\n“And because he liked you; which – I’m certain – also motivated Arthur Smithies. But then, Uncle, why did you look so sad just now: not just sad but deflated.”\n“It’s the cup and saucer which I gave him. I still can’t understand why they have vanished without a trace. Also, he told you ‘Dawn’ graced his sitting room; so why is it displayed on that ridiculous wall?”\n“I see; but, remember, he wrote that letter to me when he was still living in Epping; and, oddly enough, the house in Woodstock doesn’t appear to have a proper sitting room. Judging from the catalogue, there is a library, a smoking room, a spacious lounge, a dining room, a King Arthur bedroom and bathroom and so on; but there is no sitting room!”\n“True,” I said; “but, of course, he could have hung ‘Dawn’ on the main wall of any one of the living rooms!”\n“So he could,” she countered; “but don’t you think that a man, who likes to relax in a comfy sitting room, would arranges to have such a place when he renovates his new house?”\n“It didn’t occur to me,” I said bewildered; “still, I roamed about in the rooms and none answers the description. So what is your explanation?”\n“I haven’t got one at present,” she smiled at me; “but I won’t be surprised if we find a simple answer to our big questions when we have had a closer look at the house.”\nWhen we alighted from the shuttle bus, which conveyed us from the car park to the house, Yuan Ming pulled my arm gently.\n“Let the others go in first, Uncle. The pieces won’t run away. I’d like to have a good look at the grounds.”\nThe shrubs of the garden at the back of the house had been carefully trimmed and the lawns neatly mowed. The beds of flowers had been meticulously weeded. Yuan Ming’s eyes savoured them. Her glance, though, kept sweeping back to the house. When we had completed our round, she turned to me: “Well, what do you think of the house? It’s quite big?”\n“Isn\u0026rsquo;t it?”\n“And how many rooms of it have you seen?”\n“Seven or eight – on the first and second floors.”\n“But there are three stories?”\n“I assumed the remaining rooms were the servants’ quarters.”\n“But how many rooms are there altogether?”\n“Twenty or so, I suspect. Actually, I only saw the rooms facing the front garden. We had no access to the other rooms.”\n“They can’t all be servants’ quarters! Let’s try to find out what is in them” she suggested, leading the way to the main entrance.\nA Christie’s employee, identified by his tag as Alan Jones, came over to meet us shortly after we had entered the house. He had noticed my reaction when I had seen ‘Dawn’ on the wall near the entrance to the hall. Concerned about my patent displeasure, he had asked a specialist from their Chinese art department to have a look. Based on his assessment they had revised their assessment.\n“The artist’s full name, I gather, is Cheng Yuan Ming” he told us.\n‘Cheng’ was the Mandarin pronunciation of Yuan Ming’s surname. Like her father before her, she used the Hokkien version – Tay – in her everyday life but transliterated the character as ‘Cheng’ when signing her works. Confident that Alan Jones was unaware of the peculiarities of Chinese writing, I told him: “I see; actually, Miss Tay is from Los Angeles; and she knows the artist.”\n“Do you know her well?” asked Alan Jones.\n“Rather,” said Yuan Ming, unperturbed, “I don’t always approve of her work, though.”\n“Let me then show you the one we have,” he volunteered, adding for my benefit “we have found a more prominent place for it.”\n‘Dawn’ was now displayed on the main wall of the library. For a few minutes the three of us concentrated on it. I could feel Yuan Ming’s hand clutching mine.\n“And do you approve of this piece?” asked Alan Jones.\n“I’ve got to agree with Uncle; I think it’s OK,” she conceded.\n“You may have some firm competition when you bid for it,” Alan Jones said to me. “We have sent details of it to a number of American dealers and three have cabled for photographs.”\n“So you won’t have a chance for a steal, Uncle; what a pity” said Yuan Ming sweetly.\n“Oh, I don’t mind that: this painting deserves to go to the highest bidder.”\n“Quite so” said Alan Jones, whose eyes had moved surreptitiously from Yuan Ming to me and back to her. “Well, and can I show you any other item, Miss Tay?”\n“Uncle tells me there is a nice oil by Tissot.”\n“Let me show it to you,” he said approvingly.\nAlan Jones took us for a tour of the European paintings. When he was done, Yuan Ming observed: “The late Sir Arthur must have been a man of taste and Uncle tells me he was also a discriminating collector. Why then all this cluttering? These rooms look like art galleries!”\n“The paintings were not displayed simultaneously,” he explained readily. “The bulk was kept in one room. I gather Sir Arthur rotated them periodically on the walls of the living areas.” Turning to me he added: “And so you knew the late Sir Arthur? And have you have been to this house before?”\n“I knew him when he was the Managing Partner of Crawfords,” I confirmed. “He was a fine banker. But I have not visited him here in Woodstock.”\n“Unfortunately, he did not complete the renovation of the house” advised Alan Jones.\n“It is a rather large house,” interceded Yuan Ming.\n“It is indeed; and in an excellent location.”\n“I agree,” she said. “And may I ask: what is going to happen to it?”\n“The executors have asked us to auction it.”\n“I wonder if Uncle and I could see the remaining rooms; we have been searching for a house in the Oxford area for some time.”\nAlan Jones\u0026rsquo; expression did not change: his face displayed no surprise. He was, patently, far more sophisticated than I had thought.\n“I\u0026rsquo;m afraid the rest of the house has been sealed off for the time being. But I can arrange for a viewing some time next week. We should have appointed an agent by then.”\n“We travel to the Continent tomorrow,” she answered. “But we’ll be back for the auction.”\n“Then I’ll try to arrange something for that day – after the auction. But, you know, this is a rather big house: probably too big for a holiday home. Would you like me to ask the agent to show you some other properties as well?”\n“That would be splendid” she agreed readily.\nAfter a perusal of the porcelain pieces, Yuan Ming and I made our way back to the shuttle bus. Soon we were again in the car park. As soon as we were on the way, Yuan Ming turned back to our search.\n“Did you have a good look at the frames of the paintings?”\n“Can’t say I did; why?”\n“The pressure marks suggest that they were placed on the floor, leaning against each other. So Arthur Smithies did rotate the mainstream of his paintings: but not ‘Dawn’.”\n“How do you know? Because there are no pressure marks on its frame?”\n“That’s one reason; and did you notice the stains along the left side of the frame?”\n“I didn’t; I simply couldn’t take my eyes off the drawing itself.”\n“I know; your friend Alan Jones noticed it too; he gave you a perplexed look!”\n“Oh well; but what is the significance of these stains on the frame?”\n“ ‘Dawn’ had not been placed on the floor, Uncle. The stains were caused by dampness. So ‘Dawn’ was hanging on a wall with damp spots. There are no signs of dampness in any of the rooms we have seen!”\n“So ‘Dawn’ was displayed on a wall in a room of the sealed off part of the house?”\n“Yes, Uncle; and I wonder what else we’ll find there when we get in.”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-hidden-rooms/chapter-2/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"3-a-confused-day\"\u003e3.

Moti, though, expressed a reservation.\n“Peter’le, why didn’t you explain things to Eve before you punched her?”\n“I thought it best to proceed without delay.”\n“But then you needed Lord Pan’s help!”\n“Moti is right: it was your mission, Peter’le. So why the need for help?” volunteered Archie.\n“But Theophil did not appear until after the mission had been completed. You see, Archie, he did not intervene. He simply helped me to explain. Actually, there was no need to elucidate. By right I was entitled to withdraw the instant I delivered the punch. In the worst case, Eve would have remained puzzled!”\n“Eve is not the type of lady who remains puzzled for long. She is too forthright,” Tiger stepped to my aid.\n“Oh well,” conceded Archie. “But now we have to plan your next punch. You must not restrict yourself to members of one culture!”\n2. Planning the Next Punch His words made sense. There were, of course, quite a number of Biblical characters deserving treatment. One was Moses who led his people astray for forty years in the desert. Another was Samuel, who took exception to Saul’s refusal to murder Amelekite women and children. Yet another was the famous Rabbi Gamliel, who applied one set of rules to the people and a more liberal doctrine to himself.\nStill, we had to move with the times. Dealing with representatives of different cultures was essential. Initially I looked in the direction of China. Instantly, Archie was up in arms. He pointed out that the two main Western cultures were the Judaic and the Greek. True, they were clumsily fused by Roman believers. All the same, Greece occupied a place of its own.\n“But there are so many deserving noses amongst the Greek!”\n“Why don’t you go quickly through them, Peter’le” opined Tiger.\nThe first name on my list was Homer. His poetry put the emphasis on style rather than substance. Others to be considered included Pericles and Plato. The former convinced his people to press on with a war they were bound to lose. The latter was a dogmatic thinker, who produced heaps of unreadable dialogues discussing ‘freedom’, copied laboriously by his slaves. What did these poor scriveners think when they were ordered to fill their inkpots and reproduce the great man’s Republic?\nThe full list of deserving noses appeared endless. As I viewed it with despair, Moti looked with concern at both Archie and me. Sensing he wanted to convey a discreet message, I climbed up his trunk.\n“What are you worried about?”\n“Archie looks jaundiced. He wonders why you have not selected him.”\n“I would never punch a friend, Moti: you know this.”\n“Oh, I know. But your mission is to punch the most remarkable figures in history. Archie believes he is one of them. He feels slighted.”\n“What were the two of you mumbling about?” Archie manifested his chagrin as soon as I slid down Moti’s trunk.\n“Moti thinks I ought to concentrate on contributors to Greece’s greatest gift to mankind.”\n“And what would that be? Philosophy, art, poetry and mathematics reached a height in our culture.”\n“But all of these progressed further in later periods. The concept of the zero, for instance, originated in India. And didn’t Leibniz’s calculus leave all Greek mathematicians far behind?” volunteered Tiger.\n“You mean we were just a midwife or, perhaps, a bubble?”\n“Peter’le thinks that Greece’s most lasting contribution to mankind was in another field; a field with which you, Archie, have no affinity,” retorted Tiger. “So why don’t you accompany him this time? I can’t imagine a more appropriate ‘objective bystander’ than your good self.”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novels/nose-puncher/part-3/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"1-assessment-of-first-performance\"\u003e1.

But the hospital bed, with the guards on both sides and the gadgets mounted on top, revealed that the room was not in an up-market hotel. It was a deluxe room in Ward xx of the National University of Singapore Hospital.\nI had been warded by Emergency. One of their doctors stitched the deep cuts on my brow and, to avoid further dehydration, put me on a drip. The physicians would take a few days to determine the cause of my fainting spell. The functioning of my heart, of the brain and of the vascular system required assessment.\nFor the time being, I was not allowed to get out of bed except under the vigilant eye of a nurse. A tag attached to my wrist ensured the edict would be observed. It reminded me of the yellow Star of David forced on my race long ago.\nAs soon as my wife and relatives left the ward, I tried to let down one of the guards so as to walk to the bathroom. But, after a short struggle, I had to give up. Resignedly, I rang the bell and had the humiliating experience of proceeding to my destination with a nurse on each side. Still, as I returned to my bed, I realised the prescribed precautions were justified. I was feeling giddy and nauseous. A second fall could not be ruled out.\nWhen, at long last, I was on my own, I waited for Theophil’s anticipated nudge. I was, of course, aware that Theophil’s nature was debatable. I had sensed his existence from my early childhood but, in the event, he did not materialise in front of my eyes until I was in my late middle age.\nMy initial reaction to his appearance was one of terror. He had chosen to reveal himself in his traditional Mephisto set-up – the Devil Incarnate of Judaism, Islam and Christianity. When my shock subsided, we had a frank chat. I had been his disciple ever since. I knew also that, without giving me clear evidence of his existence, he had looked after me from the day of my birth. I had no evidence of his being evil. In my eyes, he had become a benevolent friend; and I had come to trust him implicitly. The knowledge that, all in all, he may be but an expression of my inner subconsciousness did not stop me from rejoicing whenever he chose to materialise.\nTo my disappointment, Theophil did not materialise in my room in the Ward. Instead, I heard his voice in my head.\n“You wonder why I let it happen?”\n“I do; but, you know, it could have been worse. If I had fallen at a slightly different angle, I would have lost an eye and broken my nose. That would have been a real mess. But you wouldn’t let that happen. Thanks.”\nTo my relief he did not refer to his policy of non-intervention. He had saved me from disasters on previous occasions. In each case I escaped unharmed. But then, why did he not help me to overcome the fainting spell?\n“I let it happen because you must begin to watch your pace. You are 72 years of age; but you work as hard as you did twenty years ago. Further, you have a daily fight with your wife. The incessant arguments leave you drained. The fall is a wake-up call; and a few days on your own in a luxury ward will do you good.”\n“I understand; and I suppose next you’ll give me an elegant walking stick. But I don’t want to grow old; and I don’t want to turn into yet another broken old drifter.”\n“There is no danger of that,” he assured me. “But you must learn to take basic precautions. You can no longer jump out of bed as soon as you wake up, Peter’le. Chronus takes his toll; and Theophil won’t do anything about it. Remember: I am not an interventionist.”\n“I understand,” I conceded awkwardly. “But how to fight boredom in this hospital ward?”\n“You can learn a lot here; keep your eyes open.”\n“Will you visit me regularly?” I asked anxiously.\n“You know I am always there; but materialising here is dangerous. If any nurse sees me, she’ll have a fit. Chatting too has its risks. If they see you talking to empty space, they’ll move you to a different institution. I suggest we talk inaudibly – mind to mind.”\n“Good precaution,” I approbated; “but I’m not sure I can control my expression.”\n“You might find it easier if we used a different language. How about Hebrew?”\n“Ata me’daber Ivrit? {You speak Hebrew}” I grinned, allowing a patronising tone to creep in by intoning the “you”. It was an uncivil expression of surprise that an outsider, like a rich American tourist, purported to command our tongue.\n“Ma ata choshev!” {what do you think!}, he snubbed back.\nBoth of us burst into laughter. Then, in a changed tone, he added: “Nurse is coming to take your blood pressure. Speak to you later.”\n“I’ve come to check your blood pressure.” The nurse, an attractive Philippina in her late thirties or early forties, wheeled in an ugly, even if functional looking, apparatus.\n“Can I go to the bathroom room first?” She summoned another nurse and, once again, I proceeded to my destination with one on each side.\n“Quite a procession,” chuckled my Hebrew speaking friend. The nurses could not hear him but, I sensed, noticed my grin. The Philippina nurse took my blood pressure before I climbed back into bed. She measured it again as I sat down. A third reading was taken when I was stretched out, again, on my back.\n“So your hypertension is postural. Didn’t you know that?”\n“No…” I started and then recalled the words of the endocrinologist in Melbourne, who had diagnosed my condition. He had advised me to treat my diabetes and ignore my irregular blood pressure. For the time being, it was best to keep it in view. I relied on his advice as an excuse for dismissing the matter from my mind.\n“A sudden change in blood pressure caused your fall,” observed Theophil. “It was unwise to rush to your bedroom when you started to feel faint: should have lowered yourself onto the floor.”\n“I understand,” I told him and was alarmed by the Philippina’s change of expression. As soon as the other nurse had left, she asked me directly whether I used to talk to myself.\n“I do,” I lied. “This way I get wise answers to smart questions.”\nShe smiled politely. Then, in a direct manner that took me by surprise, she wanted to ensure I had not been speaking to someone else. “There is no outsider here,” I told her.\n“Not somebody we can see,” she agreed.\nI was about to turn the issue into a joke when Theophil warned, albeit in Hebrew, that he had placed her. She was the daughter of a disciple who had defected and turned back to faith. Following his withdrawal, Theophil ceased to keep tabs on the defector and his family. He thought I might as well tell her the truth: she knew a great deal about him from the days of his friendship with her father.\n“Actually, I do talk to my pilot. I’ve known him for years.”\n“Is he who I think he is?”\n“He is,” I conceded. “I call him Theophil.”\nI was about to add a few words, but cut myself short as an elderly Philippino, with neatly combed hair, golden rimmed spectacles and a goatee, wearing a black shirt and a dark pair of trousers, materialized in front of us. I had not seen this image before.\n“Father José!” exclaimed the nurse.\n“Father José died years ago,” replied Theophil. “He was a nice man. I just ‘borrowed’ his image.”\n“But didn’t you resent him? He pulled Dad back into the Church?”\n“Of course not, Susan. To start with I have no emotions. Your Dad told you so many times. And I do believe in free choice. A ‘disciple’ has the right to change his mind till the very end.”\n“Some won’t,” I interceded, feeling a pang of envy at the rapid progress he made in securing her goodwill.\n“I know,” soothed Theophil, assuming the image of a broad-shouldered octogenarian – the image of my late friend Peppi Stölzl.\n“Is this the costume he uses when he visits you?” she asked me. “And who was he?”\n“A close friend of my late father, of myself and of Theophil. I met him late in life, when he had set himself up as an antiques dealer in London.”\n“But does Mephisto always use this image when he visits you?”\n“Or his other one – the traditional one. But it might give you a scare!”\n“Let’s try,” summed up Theophil and transmuted himself into the archfiend.\nSusan did not bat an eyelid. Had she seen him, in this form, before or was she too sophisticated to take a fright? “But is this your real form?” she wanted to know.\n“My real form – if this is the word – is invisible to the human eye. What you see is the image familiar from times immemorial! Most people freak out when they perceive it. How comes you didn’t?”\n“Dad told me a lot about you. Even after he returned to the fold, he continued to admire you. Still, your emergence settles one point: for a whole term, in the University of Manila, our Professor of Philosophy discussed ‘the existence of God’. We were unable to reach a conclusion based on reasoning. But surely, if you exist so must He?”\n“Does the existence of one metaphysical being establish the existence of others?” he wanted to know.\nAs she stood there lost in her thoughts, an attendant brought in my afternoon snack. Another nurse came to take my blood sugar. Discreetly, Susan withdrew. When I was once again on my own, I turned to Theophil: “So she is an educated woman!”\n“That much was clear from the way she addressed us!”\n“What can you tell me about her?”\n“You better put your questions directly to her. But be careful not to fall for her. She won’t respond.”\n“Bruised too badly earlier in life?”\n“Why not find our from her!”\nFor the next two hours I watched films on the television. It was a luxury denied to me at home, where my wife, Pat, regarded the t.v. as her own toy. Having no interest in the Chinese soaps she kept watching, I usually spent the evenings with my computer. Here, in the Ward, the t.v. was at my disposal. To my delight, one of the films available was the Mutiny on the ‘Bounty’, with Charles Laughton.\n“So, you are not too badly off here,” chuckled a familiar voice.\n“Right as always,” I had to concede, “and thanks for the arrangements.”\n“You better switch the light off soon; you are far more tired than you realise.”\nSeveral times during the night I was woken up by nurses wheeling in the blood pressure monitor. In the morning, I was checked by a neurologist, a cardiologist and by the ward doctor. Shortly thereafter, Pat came to visit me, bringing along some relatives. While they conversed in their native dialect – which I did not understand – I took a nap. When, at long last, they were gone – with Pat looking at me reproachfully – I watched The Third Man. As often before, I was moved by the gesture of the badly wounded Harry Lime, pressing his friend to finish him off.\nSusan turned up for the afternoon session. When she completed the medical procedures and made a record in my patient’s card, I asked her what had induced her to come to Singapore.\n“The job,” she replied laconically.\n“But why would a Philosophy Graduate of Manila University look for a job in a hospital in Singapore?”\n“Didn’t he tell you?” She replied, looking over my shoulder.\n“He suggested I ask you directly.”\n“I don’t divulge people’s secrets,” explained Father José, materialising in front of our eyes.\n“I see,” she replied, mollified. “But then, he is your disciple. I am not!”\n“That makes no difference,” he explained. “A confidence is a confidence.”\n“Is he discreet?”\n“He is,” confirmed Father José. “Like all lawyers, he is curious but, at the same type, tends to respect a confidence.”\nFor a few seconds, Susan looked undecided. Then, with a mild shrug of her shoulders, she embarked on her story. Before long, I realized how little I knew of alien cultures and people.\nWhen Susan graduated, she started to look for a job. Initially, her attempts were unsuccessful. A degree in Arts – especially with a major in Philosophy – had no currency in Manila. Teaching jobs were unattractive and, in any event, very few schools in Manila were in a position to hire. Turning down an administrative post in a Secondary School, she continued to knock on doors which, alas, remained closed.\n“But then,” I asked, “why hadn’t you enrolled in Law or in Medicine?”\n“My school results were marginal; and I had no connections. So only Arts was available.”\nSusan was about to give up when Fortuna decided to smile. An enterprising businesswoman, who ran a smart boutique, offered to take her in. Susan made a success of it. She had to work hard, had to learn how to handle difficult customers and how to arrange her show windows and the racks of women’s clothes. By the end of her second year, her satisfied employer left the management of the shop in her hands. In due course, Susan was constituted a partner.\n“Sounds like a success story: all rise and no setbacks,” I pointed out.\n“Life is not that simple,” she sighed.\nTo meet the standard demanded by her employer, Susan had to spend long hours away from home and from her husband, Paulo.\n“You married during your University days?” I wanted to know.\n“I did,” she smiled.\n“Did you have an active social life during your years of studies?”\n“Not really. I spent most of my time in the lecture theatres and the library. I met Paulo in a cafeteria near the campus. He was the manager. Well, he kept looking at me and I thought he was sort of cute. Eventually, we started to go out. When I discovered I was pregnant, Paulo proposed. I accepted.”\nThe arrival of her son created problems. During her first two years at the boutique, her mother-in-law looked after the son. When the matron passed away, Susan engaged her own sister, Maria, a young, unmarried and jobless girl as maid cum nanny.\nInitially, everything worked out well. Then, shortly after Paulo was retrenched by the owners of the cafeteria, Susan observed that he and Maria were getting increasingly close to one another. Occasionally, when she was about to leave home in the morning’ they exchanged furtive glances.\n“What did you do?”\n“It appeared best to close my eyes. I did. Then, one day when I came home early, I found them together.”\n“What did you do?”\n“I suppressed my urge to make a fuss. I stared at them for a while and then left the room.”\n“What did they say?”\n“They were too shocked to say a word. When he recovered, Paulo pulled the blanket over them.”\nThere was no longer room for the ostrich tactics. Susan had to take a stand or lose her dignity and credibility at home. Sending Maria back to the family home was a poor solution. It would sort out the immediate issue but could not bring Paulo and herself back together. The only way out, she concluded, was a change of scene.\nIn the event, her business partner, who had by then become a friend, suggested a spell overseas and offered to put Susan in charge of a boutique in Singapore. She suggested Susan proceed on her own. Time would reveal the appropriate long-term solution.\n“But wasn’t this an escape – a means to get away from the problem?”\n“It probably was; but I couldn’t see another way out.”\n“Didn’t you ask for a divorce?” I assumed the courage to ask.\n“But for our son, I would have demanded it. But I am not sure a Judge in the Philippines would have granted it. Ours is a Roman Catholic country.”\nWhen Susan arrived in Singapore the local boutique was struggling. Within a few months she managed to turn it into a thriving business, popular with expatriates and the wives of the local elite. Unburdened by a husband and a home, she devoted all her time to the shop. It became another success story.\nThen the pendulum swung. From her very arrival in Singapore, Susan had sent money to her home in Manila. Maria – a kindly person by disposition – used the funds mainly to look after her nephew’s education. Susan thrived on the favourable reports on his progress in school. His sporadic letters affirmed that he enjoyed a pleasant existence. His letters, though, were not warm.\nSusan realised that her links with her family were becoming tenuous. Her son did not miss her. She had not played a significant role in his upbringing. Even before she left Manila, she had been a distant mother.\nSusan hoped to repair the damage on a forthcoming visit to her hometown. An unexpected telephone call shattered her dreams. Crying as she spoke, Maria advised the boy had died from an infection picked up at school. They had rushed him to hospital and, for a while, they hoped he would pull through. He was amongst the ones who did not.\nWhen the funeral and the period of intense mourning were over, Susan decided to return to Singapore. Paulo and Maria had become a close-knit couple. Susan had no desire to intrude. Before she left, Paulo told her he had found a job. Maria, too, was contributing to the household expenditure from occasional needle and knitting work sent to her. Paulo told Susan she need not send them money any longer.\nBack in Singapore, Susan tried to go on as usual. Looking after the boutique was, of course, no hurdle. The problem was a feeling of emptiness she experienced when she went back home late in the evening. Prior to her son’s sudden death, she used to dream about a family reunion. These personal aspirations had been nipped in the bud.\n“What did you do? And how did you end up with a hospital job. It must be far more demanding than running a boutique; and surely: it is not well paid?”\n“Of course it is not well paid. I made much more in the shop. And, as you ought to know, nursing is a demanding job.”\n“What made you swap?” I asked, prompted by curiosity. “Why didn’t you stay put?”\n“That awful feeling of emptiness!”\n“But why? You had become a successful businesswoman?”\n“That was one way of looking at it. On the personal side, I was a failure. I was in my thirties, effectively unmarried and childless. Often, I wondered where I had made my mistake; was it in neglecting my home?”\n“No Susan,” said Father José, who materialised in front of us.\n“What was it then?” she implored.\n“You married the wrong man! You are a strong and resourceful woman. You needed a sturdy companion: a man with a strong character.”\n“And Paulo had always been a weakling!”\n“You never looked up to him. You married him because you got yourself pregnant and because Paulo was a good looking and kindly man …”\n“ … suitable for a casual affair but poor husband material!” she concluded.\n“Precisely,” confirmed Theophil. “Still, you did find a way out of the void in your life.”\n“How do you know all this. You must have been keeping an eye on me for years!”\n“No, Susan,” he responded readily. “But after we met, two days ago, I used my … resources … to make an assessment. Well, in my judgment, you did very well!”\n“Don’t you overlook the role played by chance?”\n“No; I don’t,” he assured us. “But luck works only if you know how to grab it!”\nSusan’s lucky break came when a regular customer turned up accompanied by a sun burnt, shriveled but self-assured companion. This companion, Lena (a nurse by profession), had returned to Singapore for a short reunion with friends and family. She came to the boutique, hoping to get blouses for patients in a hospital in Kenya. She had been working there for the last few years.\n“What decided you to go there?” Susan had asked Lena.\n“I was getting fed up and tired with the regime in the hospital in Singapore. Most of our patients were well to do people, some of them local but most from wealthy Indonesian families. We had to cater to their whims and do our best to meet their often-capricious demands.”\n“And in Kenya?”\n“It is a poor country; the work is hard but I get job satisfaction; and I am needed!”\nSusan met Lena a few times. In the process, Susan formed an impression of her new friend’s motives and aspirations. She realised that, having turned her back on material success, Lena was getting satisfaction from the sacrifice she was making. Unlike Lena, Susan had no altruistic streak; she had always been a hardheaded and realistic entrepreneur. At the same time, she appreciated the happiness derived from dedication to a hard and demanding job.\nA few weeks after Lena’s return to Kenya, Susan resigned from the boutique and enrolled in a course on nursing. She realised that, to be effective in a nursing post in a Third World Country, she had to acquire the necessary knowledge and experience. A spell in the National University of Singapore Hospital was bound to provide the required qualifications.\nSusan turned out to be well suited for a nursing job. She had the necessary commitment, the dedication and a good bedside manner. Patients admired her. Within four years she rose through the ranks to a senior position. Once again, it was a success story.\n“Are you going to remain here then?” I asked.\n“No. As soon as I have saved enough I am moving to some Third World Country, where a good nurse is in high demand. I have kept in touch with Lena; and she has offered to let me know when she finds a suitable opening.”\nHaving digested Susan’s story, I wondered what had induced her to open up. She struck me as a reserved person. What had prompted her to drop her guard?\n“To whom did she tell her story?” asked Theophil in Hebrew.\n“To both of us, I suspect,” I conceded willingly.\n“Wasn’t she addressing someone else as well?”\n“Not the real Father José,” I protested. “She knows he is dead.”\n“True. But wasn’t there as third person in the room?” he prompted.\n“Surely, not” I pointed out; and then – at long last – the penny dropped.\n“I get it,” I told him. “She was soliloquizing. That explains the irritation she displayed whenever I interrupted her flow.”\n“Precisely. Susan is tight lipped and world wise. But she knows her late father trusted me even after he defected; and I assured her of your discretion.”\n“So she unburdened herself,” I summed up.\nAs we conversed, Susan’s eyes shifted between me and Theophil, disguised as Father José. On several occasions she sought to intercede but, with a shrug of her shoulders, kept her counsel. For a while, the three of us remained silent. Then spontaneously, she asked me what I thought of her plan. She smiled with satisfaction as I assured her that she had come up with an excellent design. It would enable her to bring comfort to those who needed her most.\n“Do you agree?” she asked Father José.\n“I do, but for a somewhat different reason. You, Susan, have strong maternal instincts. On many occasions you were driven by the wish to assist, or to look after the needs of others. When you succeeded, you felt fulfilled.”\n“So?” she asked, puzzled.\n“Your plan centres on this very instinct. I doubt the ability of any person, be he a physician, a nurse, a missionary or a political leader, to have a genuine effect on the disaster faced by the people of many Third World Countries. But your plan fits in with your own needs and personality. So go ahead!”\nWhen she was gone, I grumbled that the choice of films on the t.v. was poor. To my relief, Theophil built in two further choices. Notwithstanding the excellence of Greta Garbo’s film on Napoleon, I opted for These Magnificent Men and their Flying Machines. After the strenuous session with Susan, I felt the need for light entertainment.\nAbout two hours later, Susan re-entered my room. Her attractive skirt and blouse suited her better than the heavily starched nurse’s uniform. It dawned on me she was an attractive and self-assured woman. Why, I wondered, had she not found another man? Were there no suitable candidates around, or had she persistently turned down advances, acting on the principle that “once bitten twice shy”?\n“I need your advice, Prof,” she said in her direct manner. “I mean your own advice; not his!”\n“We usually see eye to eye but, in any event, what is it?”\n“I checked my bank balance on my way home. Somebody paid $15,000.00 to my credit. I now have the means to leave forthwith.”\n“You probably won some raffle,” I soothed, sensing with trepidation what was on her mind.\n“I never buy such rubbish. Surely, you know who paid the money in!”\n“Perhaps he did. But why does this matter? There are no strings attached; and he knows you aren’t a disciple.”\n“But, look, Prof. I know you admire and love him. So did my father. But isn’t he the epitome of evil? How can I accept his gift?”\n“But why do you consider him evil? What harm has he done to mankind?”\n“How about wars, earthquakes and other disasters?”\n“Why do you attribute them to him? He does not claim to be the Creator.”\n“Well said,” I heard Theophil’s voice in my mind.\n“And how about his very first encounter, with Eve? He taught her disobedience!”\n“He taught the mother of mankind to use her own mind. He made her realise she was more than a pretty and mindless doll. He revealed to her she was a woman – a woman capable of bearing children.”\n“I take your point. Still, I’m not convinced,” she said after a short silence.\n“But Susan,” said Father José as he materialised in front of our eyes. “What distinguishes good from evil? Doesn’t the answer depend on a person’s outlook?”\n“Weren’t the Holocaust or slavery evils?”\n“Those who profited from them did not think so,” I stepped in. “Dixieland conducted a civil war in a desperate attempt to perpetuate slavery and cotton!”\n“That’s a sophistry,” she protested.\n“I disagree,” I countered firmly. “Let me tell you of one of the deeds of the greatest military genius of all times.”\n“You mean Genghis Khan?”\n“I do indeed. When he took Bokhara by treachery, he spared some of the inhabitants. Later, he used them as a human shield, driven in front of his soldiers when his army stormed Samarkand. The defenders were not prepared to kill their kin. Well, when the army closed in on the city, the Mongols killed their hostages and, over their dead bodies, stormed the walls. The city fell!”\n“How ghastly,” exclaimed Susan. “Surely, Prof, that is evil and unforgivable cruelty.”\n“As seen by the defenders of Samarkand …”\n“ … and, by any common human standards, it was nasty,” she concluded.\n“But how about Mongol soldiers advancing in the front line? The human shield saved many of their lives. They praised and admired their leader for his concern for their safety! They did not think his tactics were evil.”\n“Well, Susan?” asked Father José.\n“I take Prof’s point,” she conceded at long last.\n“Nothing is evil per se,” concluded Theophil. “Take the money and put it to good use. And if you need my help over there, call me!”\n“As Prof said, I am not a disciple!” Susan insisted.\n“I know,” he affirmed. “But that, Susan, makes no difference. Let us say that I’ve acted on the spur of the moment. Remember: I too am entitled to my whims.”\nUsing her unclaimed leave, Susan left the hospital two days later. I do not know what became of her. I hope she re-discovered happiness or, in the very least, self-satisfaction.\nNext morning a porter took me in a wheelchair to the x-ray and imaging department. After the tests had been completed, another porter wheeled me back to the ward. When a door connecting two corridors suddenly swung in our direction, nearly knocking my wheelchair over, the porter moved me adroitly to safety. Looking at him searchingly, I realised who he was.\n“Thanks, Theophil,” I exclaimed.\n“Did you ever imagine, Sir Peter, that one bright day I would wheel you about?”\nAs we proceeded along the winding corridors, my mind turned to a question that had troubled me often before. Theophil had claimed persistently that he had no emotions. Why then had he been so kind to me and, to a point, even to Susan? He had claimed that his relationship with me was a symbiosis rather than a friendship. His argument had force. Maybe our relationship involved mutual support. But then, why would he have provided the funds needed for Susan’s plan? True, it might have been a whim. But then, why had he not salvaged the hostages when the Mongols pressed them on to the walls of Samarkand?\n“Once again, Peter’le, you are asking yourself if I have emotions and, if I do, why do I deny their existence?”\n“Precisely.”\n“Are you up to a discussion of the subject? Aren’t you tired after these tests?”\n“I think I can manage,” I assured him.\n“Very well then, let us move to a less noisy place.”\nThe tidy reception room had an eerie ambience. I suspected it was in a place far removed from Earth. As I took a comfortable chair at the ebonised conference table, the usual set of 18th century Meissen porcelain materialised in front of us.\n“Have a cup,” invited Theophil; “a hot coffee will do you good.”\n“After you,” I told him.\n“How gracious,” he approbated, and proceeded to pour the delicious coffee into our cups.\nMy nerves, which had been tested by the unpleasant procedures prescribed by the physicians, were soothed by the strong brew. After a second cup, I was back to myself. Seeking to speed up my lethargic intellect, I held my hand out.\n“No, Peter’le. This time you have to proceed on your own.”\n“Are you concerned I may speed up to the limit?” I asked, reflecting on the speed of thought I experienced whenever we linked. On quite a few occasions, my mentor had to break the contact to ensure I did not burn myself out.\n“That too,” he nodded. “These medical procedures – primitive as they are – take a lot out of a patient. Speeding up or any further exertion is inadvisable. Still, today I am not so much concerned about the speed as about the ‘influence’. This time you better reach your conclusions without external aid.”\nA review of my many encounters with Theophil convinced me that he liked me. I had, further, noticed that he approbated of other people we met. Susan was but one example. Theophil was, then, capable of likes and, presumably, dislikes. Further, he had conceded that he was grieved whenever a disciple deserted him. Was he then capable of experiencing some emotions.\n“What triggers human emotions?” asked Theophil.\n“Three instincts, I believe: the survival instinct (which is the motivation behind most humans’ search for success and glory), the sexual instinct and curiosity. The sexual instinct is dominant. Up to a point, it explains also our aesthetic appreciation. For instance, a Man’s admiration of a smart outfit, of a fashionable bonnet and a nice pair of shoes are closely related to his appetites.”\n“So, you see my problem,” he approved. “I do have the survival instinct: it is common to all beings and creatures in the universe and other dimensions.”\n“But you are ‘timeless’. Death does not provide a threat!”\n“True. But the universe may be finite. Like Him, I emerged at the beginning. But I am concerned about the ‘end’ which even I cannot ‘survive’.”\n“I see,” I agreed after a pause. “The only instinct missing in your case is the sexual drive …”\n“ … and the immediate products of it. When I try to read emotions linked to the sexual instinct, I face a blur.”\n“But I know you can read my emotions and, I suspect, you read Susan’s emotions.”\n“Some of them,” he agreed. “But these are special instances. In your case, my clairvoyance stems from our long association. In her case, I was guided by my understanding of her father.”\n“But in ordinary instances, especially where the emotions are complex and triggered by a combination of instincts, your ability to read is limited.”\n“And I can get confused!”\n“But surely, the sexual instinct is closely linked to the survival instinct,” I pointed out.\n“In humans, the two are inter-related – perhaps inseparable; but, of course, not in my dimension.”\n“So, what is the problem?” I persisted.\n“It is difficult for any being to probe something which, to a large extend, is alien to him. And, Peter’le, the sexual drive tends to intervene in most human motivations. Once it affects an issue, reading gets tough.”\n“I see: you prefer to probe an issue – or episode – with somebody who can read the emotions effortlessly. It makes sense.”\n“It does; and I proceed on this basis.”\n“Your lack of emotions, then, is subject to certain exceptions,” I concluded.\n“It is,” he conceded.\n“But then, Theophil, what causes you to like or dislike a person? I know you like me – always did. But I am not a strong, superior or outgoing individual. I am aware I have feet of clay!”\n“Perhaps that’s why I like you; and let’s not forget that you are also dogged, resourceful and intelligent. So is Susan, and she, as you know, is endowed with a strong character.”\n“I know,” I agreed. “I could have never walked away from a ruined marriage in the manner she did. I’d try to salvage the situation: find a compromise; and make a real mess in the process.”\n“You would,” nodded my mentor. “But, when all facts are considered, both Susan and yourself are unusual characters. That makes both of you interesting and hence likeable.”\n“I understand,” I agreed, adding to myself that, unlike most humans, his emotions would not be affected or distorted by a direct or indirect sexual motivations.\n“True,” he responded, having read my mind.\nNeither of us had anything to add. Back in my room in the Ward, both of us stared at a functional, yet unadorned, aluminium walking stick, which had been placed next to my bed.\n“They want me to use it as I start walking along the corridors of the ward,” I muttered, feeling defeated by the implications involved. In addition, I took a dislike to the object. Did it have to be so mundane?\n“You may prefer this one,” said Theophil as a magnificent cane, made of carved ebonised wood and boasting a fine ivory handle, materialised in front of my eyes.\n“It’s lovely,” I told him, “many thanks.”\n“Tell them it’s a gift from Father José,” he chuckled.\nBachan After my return to the ward, I rested for two hours. I then had to face a visit of some of my in-laws, brought over by my wife. For a while they made the effort of conversing with me in English. Then – as if by a signal – they switched over to Hokkien. Before long they were immersed in a discussion of their own daily affairs.\n“Who gave you this cane?” my wife looked with overt suspicion at the handsome walking stick.\n“A nice old Philippino pastor called Father José. Years ago, I tutored his younger brother. He recognised me and wished to show his respect. He gave me his own cane. Isn’t it lovely?”\n“Ugh,” she voiced her dislike. “I thought it was a gift of one of the pretty nurses!”\n“How very interesting,” I muttered. “Why would she give me a cane?”\n“To tell you, you are a useless old man.”\n“Thanks for the compliment,” I summed up. “Aren’t you sweet?”\n“Sarcasm is the lowest form of humour,” rebuked a voice in my head.\nShortly after my visitors had left, a nurse came to monitor my blood pressure and sugar levels. When she was done, she mentioned that a patient in an adjacent room recognised me. His door had been ajar when I was wheeled back to the ward.\n“I think he would love to see you. Let me wheel you over. He is bedridden.”\n“Go ahead,” prompted Theophil. “He is a friend from the old days, fallen, alas, on hard times.”\nThe patient I went to visit was a dark Indian fellow in his mid sixties. His pie bald head, sagging shoulders, wrinkled face and skinny arms projected an aura of defeat. He was clean shaved but the occasional stubbles showed his beard had gone white.\nInitially, I was unable to recognise him. Then I observed the twinkle in his dark eyes and the ghost of a smile spreading over his face.\n“Have I changed that much?” he asked in a husky, alien voice.\n“B…b..ach…an,” I stammered.\n“At your service, Sir,” he chuckled.\nIt took me a while to recover from my shock. When I knew him in the old days, Bachan was a broad shouldered and heavy-set giant. The bedridden man in the ward was an emaciated shadow of my erstwhile student. He had aged considerably less gracefully than I or any of his contemporaries.\n“I thought you had settled in Perth, Bachan,” I tried to salvage the situation. “When did you return to our shores?”\n“Ages ago, Sir,” he grinned, then added awkwardly. “You see, my Australian wife ran away. I planned to stay put but, then, I met Lynn, a nice dental nurse who came over from Singapore to visit her sister. She took me back to Singapore.”\n“But wasn’t that rather sudden?”\n“It was,” he nodded.\n“How did you settle your affairs?”\n“There wasn’t much to settle,” he said flatly. “A young colleague took over my files. All I had to do was to give up my office and sell my house. No big deal!”\n“And how did you re-settle in Singapore?” I ventured.\n“Not too well. Most of my old friends had long forgotten about me.”\n“You better tread carefully,” Theophil told me in Hebrew. “Bachan had acquired a dubious reputation in Perth. He was regarded tricky and untrustworthy. This type of information travels fast. Back at home nobody wanted to take him in!”\n“How about your family?” I asked Bachan.\n“They washed their hands off me when I married Jill.”\nI was about to ask why Jill had left him but was stopped by Theophil. Bachan, Theophil whispered to me, wanted to have children but Jill refused. This led to endless arguments and scenes. In addition, Bachan made certain demands, and indulged in practices, which Jill had found repugnant.\nHaving failed to secure a post in an established Singapore law firm, Bachan started to practice on his own. Although none of his old friends offered him a post, some kept referring to him undemanding and usually not too remunerative matters. There were also some walk-in clients, who engaged him for simple matters such as traffic offences. All in all, work was not abundant but, in the very least, he eked out a living.\nBachan’s main comfort was his home life. True, Lynn was not a beauty. But she was a self-assured, vivacious, supportive and understanding wife. She kept Bachan happy. Further, her contribution to the household expenditure enabled them to enjoy a comfortable existence. Then, unexpectedly, Lynn developed cancer of the stomach. She struggled bravely for a few months but, in the end, passed away.\nBachan was devastated. Friendless and lonely, he started to hit the bottle. Often, he was too inebriated to go to his office. Before long, he lost most of his clients. One morning he collapsed in a supermarket and was rushed to ‘emergency’. Like myself, he was admitted into Ward XX.\nBachan’s sad story contrasted sharply with his joyous life during his university days. I had come to know him well when I was constituted a residential fellow of Raffles Hall. Bachan, who was in his third year of studies, shared a room with Simon, a Chinese student from a middle-class background. Their corridor was adjacent to mine.\nShortly after I joined the Hall, Bachan organised a welcome lunch, at a well-known eatery owned by a fellow called Gomez. The grapevine had it that Gomez stirred his pots with his ‘leprous finger’. Still, his South Indian curries were so hot that the bacteria succumbed.\nGomez’ curries were, indeed, pure fire. To consume them, I had to drink one glass of ice water after the other. Bachan cherished my profuse thanks but, on future occasions, led us to a North Indian eatery. I enjoyed the mild chicken livers and sea food curries while Bachan and his gang ordered such hot dishes as were available.\nOnce a week our two corridors engaged in a contest of strength, known as a tug of war. Two teams pulled a rope in their opposite directions. Unfortunately, some problems arose from the terrain. Usually, the team stationed on the upper part of the slope lost out to the team on the lower part. As the teams changed their position after each tug, the general outcome per afternoon was a draw.\nBachan and I were the ‘heavy weights’ on each side. As he was some ten kilos heavier than me, we ensured that our team included some husky fellows. Initially both teams used the same tactic. Each had a timer who, upon the blow of the whistle, yelled “one … two … three: pull”. Seeking to gain an advantage, I induced our timer to forego the count to three and, instead, shout “pull, ho” as soon as the whistle was blown. Taken by surprise, Bachan’s team lost that tug although they were stationed on the favourable, lower, terrain.\nThey took their revenge in the following week. When our timer yelled “pull, ho” his counter-number commanded: “let go”. As our team members stumbled over each other, Bachan’s group pulled us up the slope. I recall Bachan’s roommate, Simon, who teamed with us that afternoon, dangling at the end of the rope and yelling “this was a mean trick, Bachan”.\nBachan’s reputation as a student was, alas, mixed. He could work hard but often failed to see the wood for the trees. Occasionally, he lost the thread of the lectures he attended. On one such occasion, the lecturer – a well-known bully – was irked by Bachan’s patent failure to concentrate. In the end, he asked Bachan to explain the last point covered in class.\n“Sorry, Sir,” confessed Bachan, “I can’t.”\n“Bachan,” roared the enraged staff member, “why don’t you jump out of the window?”\n“After you, Sir,” retorted Bachan.\nUnsurprisingly, Bachan maintained a low profile at the Faculty. In the Hall, he was one of our bright sparks, always happy to mastermind the organisation of our numerous functions and parties. In my first year in residence, Bachan took charge of the preparations for our annual, festive, dinner. The master of the Hall contributed by raising extra funds for drinks.\nAs expected, everybody partook. By 9.00 p.m. most of us had more to drink than was to be recommended. Some slept it off under the huge dining table, others danced merrily on its top and the few remaining semi-sober fellows withdrew discreetly to their quarters where, in the very least, they had beds.\nAs the proceedings turned chaotic, I saw Bachan dancing happily on the stage. Being well stoned, it occurred to me that it would be nice to have Bachan’s smart green turban. It was, I felt certain, far more desirable than Bobby’s helmet.\nActing on my whim, I offered Simon – Bachan’s roommate and bosom pal - S$10.00 for the trophy. Simon hesitated but, when I doubled my offer, his eyes gained lustre. Still, cold bloodedly he demanded $25.00 – a substantial amount in those remote golden days. Reluctantly, I closed the bargain.\nA few minutes later, all of us were startled by a haul of anger. Simon, who was a small chap, made a triple somersault, coming to rest against a sliding door. Anxiously, Bachan rushed over to his side.\n“Oh my God,” he wailed, “what have I done?”\n“You, Bachan, better learn to reckon with your own strength,” muttered Simon as he rose back to his feet, dusted himself and proceeded in the direction of the conveniences.\nLater in the evening, I discovered the entire truth. Simon had told Bachan about my offer and suggested they share the spoils on a fifty-fifty basis. Bachan insisted that, as the object of the transaction was his turban, he deserved $15.00. When Simon called him ‘a turbaned skinflint’, Bachan lost his temper. He did not punch his friend but simply pushed him out of the way.\nTwo days later, when I returned to the Hall after work, I was surprised to discover a neatly folded green turban on my table. The card accompanying it read: “Sorry for the fuss, Sir.”\nIn the following academic session, Bachan became my problem. Contrary to my advice, he enrolled in my Advanced Banking Law course. The subject was difficult and the issues were complex. Occasionally, it was difficult to reconcile the mass of judicial pronouncements found in English and local authorities. Even the brightest students were, frequently, struggling.\nBy the end of the first semester most students came to grips with the convoluted subject. Bachan was the exception. His mid-year exam revealed that he had not managed to master the relevant topics. I feared that if his final year paper was to be of a similar calibre, he would have to be failed. The problem was serious: Simon had told me in confidence that if Bachan did not pass, his father would withdraw his financial support.\nThe only way out was to give Bachan some extra tuition. When I went over to his room to make the offer, I was flabbergasted to see Bachan leaning against the wall whilst standing on his head. His eyes were closed and he was chanting words in an alien language. Had he gone off his rocker?\nIt seemed best to withdraw quietly and think the matter over. To soothe my nerves, I went over to the cafeteria and ordered a cup of the strongly brewed local coffee.\n“I must have given you a turn, Sir,” said Bachan, who sneaked in while I was sipping my coffee.\n“You did rather,” I affirmed. “What on earth are you up to?”\n“Look, Sir: I know I’m not a bright student. But my Guru assures me that I’d have a chance if I stand on my head for half an hour every morning and say some prayers!”\nNotwithstanding the Guru’s counsel, Bachan’s final year paper was even worse than his attempt at mid year. If my own assessment were final, I would have had no option but to fail him. Fortunately, we had at that time a regime of external examiners. It seemed best to pass Bachan and settle the matter when our ‘external’, a well-known scholar of London University, put in his appearance.\n“I have approved all your marks, except this one,” the ‘external’ told me when we met. “Do you really think this candidate deserves a pass? Was his class performance outstanding?”\n“Well …” I stammered, “ … actually it wasn’t. He was a marginal candidate throughout.”\n“On what basis do you, then, recommend a pass?”\nA twinkle crept into the external examiner’s eye, when I told him how I found Bachan standing on his head. His stern expression mellowed as I expounded the Guru’s advice. When I finished the story, our seriously minded ‘external’ was grinning from ear to ear.\n“We can’t possibly slight the Guru,” he concluded and added his signature to mine.\nA few days later, when the decisions of the Board of Examiners had been posted on the noticeboard, I saw Bachan hailing a taxi.\n“Where are you off to, Bachan?”\n“Downtown, Sir,” he confided. “I’ve got to pay my Guru.”\n“I understand,” I muttered when I recovered my voice.\n“They were great days,” said the bedridden invalid.\n“Weren’t they ever?” I affirmed.\n“They were the best years of my life; my heyday.”\n“Would you like to turn the clock back,” I asked indiscreetly.\n“Of course! I only wish it was possible! And how about you, Sir. Wouldn’t you like to turn back?”\n“I’m not so sure, Bachan,” I told him. “Life was full of uncertainties then. I’d rather stay put.”\n“My life is full of uncertainties now,” he told me sadly.\nBack in my room, I reflected on Bachan’s unfortunate life. What had gone wrong with his journey? His wish to turn the clock back worried me. The old days had had their lustre. But most men I knew had no wish to traverse the road again. Had Bachan’s Odyssey involved a slow but steady decline?\n“It did rather,” advised Theophil.\n“But where did he go wrong? Was it his move to Perth?”\n“What where his prospects in Singapore?” asked my friend.\n“Poor; everybody liked him but nobody took him seriously.”\n“Precisely,” said my mentor. “You see, Bachan opted for the wrong profession!”\n“What makes you think so?”\n“His record. He passed his exams due to the examiners’ misguided generosity; and thereupon he was entitled to practise. But was he going to be any good as a lawyer?”\n“Well,” I yielded. “What should he have done?”\n“He should have looked for a more suitable career. Bachan had the making of an excellent entertainer or hotel executive. He was a shrewd individual but lacked the ‘machinery’ to make it in the world of the law.”\n“Passing him was a mistake?”\n“It was,” agreed Theophil. “You and the ‘external’ delivered the coup de grace!”\n“I wish I hadn’t looked Bachan up this afternoon!”\n“Nonsense,” contradicted Theophil. “You walked with him down the memory lane! This made his day!”\nLater in the evening my wife came over, this time without appendage. We chatted for a while, trying to decide what to do when I was discharged. Our flat – in Singapore’s oldest but homeliest condominium – was comfortable; it suited us. But the stairs from the lift lobby to our floor constituted a problem. Would either of us be able to manage the climb in a few years?\nNext morning I was wheeled over to the main building for the last and final test. On my way, I noticed that the door to Bachan’s room was wide ajar and his bed was empty.\n“I’d love a cup of coffee,” I told Theophil, who could always hear me. “And then it would be time to look Bachan up.”\n“I am afraid that’s not on,” he told me directly. “You see, Bachan passed away late last night!”\nI looked around me in dismay: “What happened? How did he die?”\n“Are you sure you want to know?”\n“I do.”\nShortly after I had returned to my own room following my chat with Bachan on the previous day, a staff member of the cashier’s department called on him in order to obtain a deposit. It was her third visit. When Bachan could not pay the amount demanded, they moved him to Class C Ward, which had no air condition. Late at night Bachan suffered an attack of breathlessness. The nurse called the duty physician but decided not to give Bachan oxygen. She was deterred by a recent circular soliciting thrift and economy in C Wards. By the time the doctor arrived, Bachan had given up the ghost.\n“I wish I had known; I should have readily paid the deposit.”\n“And you wonder why I didn’t make an arrangement or, in the very least, nudged the nurse to apply the oxygen mask?”\n“I do, rather. You see, Theophil, you willingly helped Susan, who kept reminding you she was not a ‘disciple’. What made Bachan unworthy?”\n“Surely, that’s not hard to see. When, Peter’le, does a person deserve help?”\n“When he (or she) is going to put it to good use.”\n“Precisely. Now, Susan had had a disastrous family life and, further, realised she was in a rut. So, she settled for an existence she was going to enjoy. She made no pretences of ‘making a sacrifice to help others’ or ‘to do good’. And, Peter’le, she made an impressive start on her own.”\n“You just nudged her along!”\n“Precisely; I like individuals who can take a hold over their lives. Up to now, you are with me, aren’t you?”\n“I am,” I conceded. Halting for a few seconds, I added: “Bachan, alas, was unable to get over Lynn’s death; any help would have just prolonged his life of misery.”\n“So now all is clear,” observed Theophil.\n“Except one point,” I told him: “I was off track several times in my life; and you stepped in and put (or ‘nudged’) me right. What made me worthy of your guidance and vigilance?”\n“We’ll discuss this some other time. There is, of course, a reason; and here is the clue: how do you, Peter’le, define our relationship?”\n“I believe I know the answer,” I confided; “but I’d like to reflect on it.”\n“Do!” he prompted.\nSoon I was back in my comfortable room. Being unable to do any real exercise, I walked up and down the corridors of the ward. My elegant cane – and the glances of admiration it earned – cheered me up.\nSoryani Late in the evening, when I was about to switch off the lights of my room in the hospital’s ward, I muttered to myself that, notwithstanding my comforts, I yearned to be discharged. Quite a few files awaited my attention in the City and a number of students wanted to see me.\n“In any event,” I mused, “I suspect I have now seen it all.”\n“Don’t kid yourself,” said the voice I knew so well.\n“Eh? Don’t tell me there is yet another person I ought to meet?”\n“There is, rather,” he volunteered. “You met her years ago when you visited your brother-in-law in Medan. One evening he took you to meet their neighbours. Do you remember how their little daughter asked her mother to give you that ebony elephant you use as a paper weight to this very day?”\n“You mean little Soryani is here in the ward? How come?”\n“She isn’t ‘little’ any longer. She is in her forties with two marriages behind her!”\n“What brought her here?”\n“Neglected cancer, which first manifested itself in her larynx. Her Indonesian surgeon botched up the initial operation.”\n“Can they save her?”\n“I don’t think so. It’s too late.”\n“Why is she in this Ward. I thought you said she was a cancer patient.”\n“She is. But, you see, when the specialists in the Cancer Ward realised she had passed the point of no return, they sent her over to this Ward. There was a shortage of beds in the Cancer Ward and no free beds in palliative care.”\n“Should I call on her?”\n“I don’t think so. She doesn’t speak much English. But Pat can converse with her. Soryani, as you may recall, is an Indonesian Chinese. She is fluent in Hokkien.”\n“What do you expect us … me … to … gain?”\n“Perhaps a better understanding of the way I function. You see, Peter’le: I did not step in to save Soryani!”\nThat night I had difficulties falling asleep. For a while I counted sheep. When this exercise remained ineffective, I let my mind travel back to the visit we had paid to my brother-in-law, breaking our journey in Medan on our way to Singapore.\nIn those days, Medan – the capital of Sumatra – was a neglected, ramshackle town. I recalled, with dismay, the stench, the dust and the flies.\nThe untidy shops and the poorly ventilated food hawker stalls, cramped on the sides of narrow streets, passed a cold shiver down my spine. Still, it seemed best to mask my reaction. Medan was Pat’s original hometown and, despite her many years in clinically hygienic Singapore, in New Zealand and in Australia, she had retained a soft spot for her old environment.\nFollowing an enjoyable trip to the hilly resort of Brastagi and a hair-raising drive to Lake Toba in the centre of the island, we wound our way back to my brother-in-law’s house in Medan. On our arrival, close to midnight, I watched with fascination how the family removed the barricade they had erected in front of the entrance door so as to keep intruders at bay. Although the entire exercise, required to enable us to enter, took only a few minutes, my brother-in-law felt the need to supervise the proceedings with his shotgun at hand.\nNext evening – just a few hours before our onward flight to Singapore – we went over to visit my bother-in-law’s neighbours. Mr. Li’s spacious house was a few notches above my brother-in-law’s comfortable but modest dwelling. It transpired that Mr. Li was a successful coffee and tobacco merchant, whose export business had grown phenomenally over the years.\nIn his broken English, Mr. Li confided that on the professional side he had every reason to be content. His main complaint was that his wife, a stern, aloof and elegantly dressed woman, had given him just one daughter. He was still hoping to have a son but the years kept passing by.\n“You can’t have everything you covet, Mr. Li,” I assumed the courage to tell him. “Look at my wife and me: no children at all.”\n“But you European: you not mind so much?”\n“Perhaps not,” I conceded; “but my wife is Chinese: and she minds.”\n“You try hard?” he asked in the directness acceptable in a Chinese society.\n“Everything, Mr. Li. We saw the best doctors; but they couldn’t help.”\n“Is great pity,” he nodded; “but, like you say, man cannot have everything. I understand you famous scholar. So perhaps is some … consolation?”\n“What would I not give to have a daughter half as cute as yours,” I told him spontaneously.\n“You think Soryani cute?” he asked proudly.\n“Of course, like a little princess from fairy land!”\nEvery member of the family cherished the compliment. Even Soryani’s stern mother bestowed a smile on me. Later on, when we enjoyed the excellent but spicy dishes served at dinner, Soryani kept bringing me glasses of iced water to stop the sweat forming on my brow. Just before we left, she said something to her mother, who – with a supportive nod – gave me the black ebony elephant carving I had admired throughout the evening. It has graced my desk ever since.\n“A little princess,” I muttered to Theophil, “long haired, olive skinned and black eyed. And now she languishes – close to her end – in a hospital room adjacent to mine!”\nSomberly, he replied: “Heaven has no favourites! You ought to know that, Sir Peter.”\n“I do, except that you – Theophil – have the power to break a human’s cycle of things.”\n“A power,” he reminded me, “I exercise sparingly!”\n“And normally only in the case of people special to you,” I added.\n“Precisely,” he agreed. “But Peter’le, I want to give you a better understanding of Soryani. Let us review her life. Naturally, they conversed in their own language; but I’ll give you a dubbed version in plain English. In some ways what has unfolded resembles a soap opera; but Peter’le, real life can be more complex than fiction!”\nMr. Li had aged during the four years following our visit to his home. His temples were now streaked with grey and his hair was receding. Lengthy periods of strain left their mark on his face. This evening, though, he was at the top of the world: next to him stood a woman considerably younger than Soryani’s mother. The bundle in her hands was the neatly wrapped up baby boy.\n“We’ll call him Ban Koon,” he pronounced.\n“But he needs an Indonesian name,” observed the proud mother.\n“Any suggestion?” Mr. Li beamed at her.\n“I like Ahmad,” she told him.\n“Ahmad it is,” he approbated. “So now the Li family has an heir. Our line will not expire when I pass away.”\n“But, Papa,” Soryani spoke haltingly, “am I no good to you?”\n“You are a good girl,” Mr. Li tried to reassure her, “but one day you’ll marry out. Every family needs a male heir: to make sure of the family’s fortunes.”\n“So, a daughter is no good,” countered Soryani. She made no effort to hide her frustration.\n“I did not mean this,” Mr. Li spoke with patent unease.\n“Perhaps a family cannot do without a son,” Mrs. Li spoke calmly yet resolutely. “But I shall leave all my money to Soryani.”\n“And how about Ahmad?” Mr. Li let his irritation show.\n“He is not my son,” replied his wife and left the room. She kept her head high, but her hands were trembling. Soryani followed her.\n“Was that the point of no return?” I asked Theophil.\n“Perhaps it was,” he affirmed. “But the rot started to set in earlier!”\n“At about the time of our spell in Medan?”\n“Earlier on,” he told me. “It took place when Mr. Li’s realised that his first wife was not going to bear him a son!”\nWe skipped through the next five years. The next screen that materialised showed Ahmad’s first day in school. Soryani, who blossomed into an attractive teenager, had taken him with her in the morning.\nWhen they arrived back at home, Ahmad complained that he had to wait two hours because Soryani’s classes ended later than his.\n“So why didn’t you take him back earlier?” asked Mr. Li sternly.\n“It is far,” Soryani spoke calmly but firmly. “I did not want to miss a class.”\n“Tomorrow you’ll take Ahmad back as soon as his class finishes.”\n“No,” said Mrs Li. “Soryani will stay for all her classes. Your son can walk back on his own. You have no right to stop Soryani from attending her classes!”\n“That’s not what I meant,” Mr. Li was cowed.\n“That is what you said,” retorted his wife. “If Ahmad wants to come back with Soryani, he must wait until she is ready.”\n“I’ll take Ahmad to school and back tomorrow,” said Mr. Li’s second wife.\n“Very well,” said Mr. Li. Then, in an attempt to reassert his authority, added “a sister must be kind to her brother.”\n“My daughter must not miss classes; her brother can wait,” replied his wife uncompromisingly. “And a brother must be kind to his sister; and a father must be good not only to a son but also to a daughter.”\n“Don’t say this,” Mr. Li let his anger show as he addressed his first wife.\n“Now you listen: I am your first wife! You better remember this, Mr. Li!”\nRuffled, Mr. Li departed. Within a few minutes no one was left in the room.\n“Quite a scene,” I told Theophil.\n“Especially if you bear in mind that we are in Indonesia: where people lay store on gracious behaviour.”\n“Was there a sequel?”\n“Wasn’t there ever!”\nFor the rest of term, Ahmad was chaperoned to school by his mother. Soryani made her own way to school and back. Often, Ahmad went after school to the homes of friends with whom he professed to do his homework. His mother waited patiently in front of the house he visited until he was ready to go back home.\nBy the end of the year, Soryani topped her class. Ahmad, in contrast, was lucky to pass. Unhappily, Mr. Li asked why Soryani had not helped her brother with his schoolwork.\n“You did not ask me, Papa,” complained Soryani.\n“And you, Soryani, stick to your own work in school. You have done well and I am proud of you,” said Mrs. Li sternly. “If Ahmad is stupid, you better get him private tuition, Mr. Li.”\n“He is not stupid,” interjected Soryani. “But he goes to play with his friends after school and does not do his homework.”\n“Is this true, son?” asked Mr. Li.\n“We do our homework together,” Ahmad spoke defensively.\n“How strange that all of you had lousy results,” Soryani had the last word.\nA few weeks later, Mr. Li told his first wife it would be best if the two families had separate homes. He had already found suitable accommodation and asked her to move as soon as possible. Mrs. Li refused. Standing her ground, she pointed out that their present house was left to her by her mother. It was her own property. If a split was desirable, Mr. Li’s second family ought to move to the new place.\n“But I spent a fortune on the renovation of this place,” sighed Mr. Li.\n“This does not give you the right to kick me out and give my house to your second family.”\nBy the end of the month, Ahmad and his mother moved out. Mr. Li shuttled between his two families. He looked worn out and tired; and he was aging fast.\nIn the next episode, Ahmad called on his stepmother and sister. He apologised profusely for neglecting them and then explained that one of his business friends was looking for a wife. He thought Soryani, who was now in her early twenties, ought to consider him. He was a good catch and a marriage with Soryani would cement the relationship of two business empires.\nSoryani’s initial reaction was negative. She had met Bambang at a party and had not been impressed. He struck her as overweight and opinionated. She could not imagine herself falling in love with him.\n“But this is not a question of love. It would be a business union. It would be of great help to Dad and me.”\n“And where is your Dad today?”\n“He feared you would snap at him,” confided Ahmad.\nSoryani was about to turn the proposition down, when her mother suggested they think it over. As soon as Ahmad was gone, Mrs. Li warned Soryani not to act hastily. Bambang was known to be a responsible and highly regarded businessman. A marriage tie might inject new blood into their own business. Ahmad, who had recently been put in charge of the firm, was not making a success out of it.\n“Ahmad is useless,” observed Soryani. “He was lucky to pass his exams here. Then father sent him to Canada but he came back without a degree. He is stupid, incompetent and arrogant!”\n“So, it is better to get a good man into the firm,” concluded Mrs. Li.\n“Is Bambang a good man? I was not impressed when we met.”\n“But you met him in Ahmad’s company,” asserted Mrs Li. “This explains why you do not like him.”\nSoryani’s wedding was a major family affair. Every member of the family was present. Mr. Li looked distinguished in his tuxedo. Ahmad wore an elegant evening suit and both Mrs. Li and Ahmad’s mother were elegantly dressed and appeared relaxed and in good cheer.\nThe ceremony itself and the sumptuous dinner that followed were of the usual high profile. After the cutting of the wedding cake, Bambang and Soryani proceeded from table to table to exchange pleasantries and to take photographs with the guests. Notwithstanding the loud ‘Yam Seng’ {bottoms up} proclaimed at each table, I knew the proceedings were tedious and felt sorry for the bride and groom.\n“I often wonder how the couple manages to proceed with it after all this fuss?”\n“Come, come, Peter’le,” grinned Theophil. “Many times, it’s not a ‘new’ experience. The ‘parties’ know all about it!”\n“And if one of them or both are ‘virgins’?”\n“Have a look at the morning after of our lovebirds’ wedding.”\nBambang was leaning against the window, looking strained and unhappy. Soryani was lying on the bed with her face turned away from him. She made no attempt to hide her frustration, disappointment and dismay.\n“They did not make it,” I told Theophil.\n“That’s obvious. Care to probe and find the reason?”\n“Of course,” I said readily.\nNotwithstanding his fatigue, Bambang had done his utmost to please his newly wedded wife. He was no newcomer to intimacy, had enjoyed the embraces of women from his early teens and had no reason to anticipate defeat. His efforts, though, remained unsuccessful. Soryani remained distant, withdrawn and aloof. Being unable to rouse her, he eventually gave up his futile efforts and in no time fell fast asleep.\n“But what went wrong, Theophil?” I wanted to know. “Both are young and not bad looking. Further, Bambang is potent; and he likes women and is at home with them.”\n“How about Soryani?” asked my mentor. Noting the puzzled expression on my face, he suggested: “Let us consult an expert. I – as you well know – am a stranger to sexual intercourse.”\nThe formally dressed man, who materialised in front of my eyes, had a long beard, a strong chin and piercing eyes. His neatly pressed suit, white shirt with a stiff collar and sober tie gave him an aura of respectability. As I watched him, he tried hard to suppress his surprise about the environment to which he had been transmuted. In the end, though, curiosity prevailed: “I’m Dr. Sigmund Freud of Vienna; where am I?”\n“In 2005, in a private conference room in an Eastern town!”\n“H’umph,” said he. “Quite a pleasant change of venue!”\n“Actually, from where did you come? Not from ‘above’, surely.”\n“Of course not: I hate the lyre and the harp and ‘they’ can’t stand my beloved percussions and horns.”\n“Did we then summon you from inferno?”\n“What an eccentric question,” he protested. “A soul cannot be roasted, affected by heat or ‘punished’ by other means of torture. No, Sir, I am heading from purgatory!”\n“From purgatory? But that’s just a place of passage, on the way to heaven.”\n“One single day there is too long. They have placed me in the Ward of Bores.”\n“But, Dr. Freud, Dante does not describe such a ‘department’!” I told him.\n“I know. His guide was too considerate to lead him through it.” Grinning sardonically, he added: “Well, Sir, what can I do for you?”\nHaving listened attentively to my account of Soryani’s life up to her marriage, he observed that she had not enjoyed a happy childhood. Ahmad’s birth had deprived her of her father’s love. She might have overcome her initial disillusionment but Mrs. Li had added fuel to the fire by feeding Soryani’s resentment and disappointment.\n“But why should that affect her nuptials with Bambang?”\n“I cannot come up with a definite answer unless she tells me her dreams and submits to psychoanalysis. My guess is that she had a fixation on her father and that his rejection laid the foundation for her turning into an iceberg. Further, Bambang was fostered on her by Ahmad, whom she has hated since he was born. That did not help.”\n“Could you have cured her?”\n“Hard to say,” admitted Dr. Freud. “Psychoanalysis is still in its infancy.”\n“So that’s that,” I said as my unexpected visitor metamorphosed back into my mentor. “What a pantomime, Theophil,” I scolded.\n“Still, Sigmund had made his point,” grinned Theophil.\n“I feel sympathy for Bambang,” I concluded. “He married Soryani in good faith and with the best of intentions.”\n“He did,” agreed Theophil. “The business aspect was secondary.”\nThe next few snippets of the kaleidoscope showed Bambang in a good light. Apart from his patience and understanding, he showered gifts on his bashful wife: a lovely string of black pearls, an elegant broche of white gold and diamonds and an endless array of flower baskets. His efforts, though, bore no fruit. Soryani did not – perhaps could not – warm up to him.\nFor a few months both Bambang and Soryani tried to work out a modus vivendi. Then Mrs. Li broke her hip. When she was discharged from the surgical ward, Soryani had to shuttle between her old family home and her husband’s elegant house. Mrs. Li was a difficult patient and demanded constant care and attention; and Soryani had remained the only person close to her. In the end, Soryani went back to live with her mother, visiting her husband sporadically. For all practical purposes, they led separate lives. Feeling rejected, Bambang found solace in other arms.\nEvents came to a head when, after a few months, Bambang asked Soryani’s consent to his taking a ‘second wife’ or ‘ts’ip’. He wanted a son and heir which, as both knew, Soryani would not give him.\nSoryani sympathised. Bambang’s proposed solution was, she knew, dictated by Chinese custom. But she could see no point in remaining formally tied to a marriage which had not worked out. She thought the interests of both would be best served if, before he remarried, Bambang gave her a divorce. Reluctantly, her estranged husband agreed.\n“You are a good man, Bambang,” said Soryani as he was getting ready to leave. “Pity our marriage did not work out. It was my fault.”\n“It is a pity,” he agreed sedately. “I only hope you re-marry to a fellow you really like. An arranged marriage is not suitable for you.”\nSoryani kept nursing her constantly ailing mother. When, a few months later, Mrs. Li passed away, her husband organised an impressive Buddhist funeral. Afterwards the family convened for the reading of the will. As was to be expected, Mrs. Li had left everything to Soryani. To Soryani’s surprise, though, a Mr. Guatama – the firm’s lawyer – took the Chairman’s place at the conference table. Smiling ingratiatingly, he advised that, in his discretion as the family’s lawyer, he proposed to realise the assets and pay the total amount over to Ahmad as Executive Officer of the family’s business.\nWhen he finished, a man sitting next to Soryani introduced himself as Mr. Rahmat and advised that he had been the late Mrs. Li’s sole legal adviser. Under the terms of the will, he was appointed sole executor and, in this capacity, was already disposing of the assets and would pay the amount realised over to Soryani.\n“But I represent the family,” insisted Guatama. “I demand that you obey my instructions.”\n“I cannot,” said his protagonist. “I must observe the terms of the will.”\n“Soryani,” said the family lawyer, “you must respect your father’s wishes. Your brother is an excellent businessman. He will invest the money on your behalf.”\nSoryani hesitated. She was about to reply, when Ahmad yelled at her: “You must obey sister. And what would you do with the money? You have no head for figures.”\n“At least as good as yours,” Soryani yelled at him. “My mother left her assets to me; and I shall take the money. What I do with it is not your business.”\n“But family piety requires that that you hand the money over; you must humbly obey brother and father,” persisted Guatama.\n“Not under the Law of Indonesia. It is Soryani’s money and I shall pay it to her!” said Rahmat.\n“I think I better leave,” said Guatama. “This is a violation of Chinese tradition and custom.”\n“Perhaps it is the best if you leave,” agreed Rahmat. “You are not the executor.”\n“I think I better also leave,” said Mr. Li. He looked old, fragile and awkward.\n“As you please,” said Soryani, before her lawyer had the time to respond.\nSoryani put her inheritance to good use. Within two years she trebled its value by smart investments in stocks and bonds. Thereafter, she founded a company, advancing funds mainly to finance international trade transactions. Her clients encompassed Bambang and his firm. As anticipated, they were punctual payees.\nSoryani’s business continued to go from strength to strength. By the end of its third year, she renovated the old family home, converting it into a large modern dwelling. The front was turned into business premises.\nMr. Rahmat became her sole legal adviser. On his advice she engaged a chauffeur cum bodyguard. Abdul, a man of mixed blood, was some five years younger than Soryani. He was good looking, broad shouldered and renowned as a brave and loyal employee. Before long, Soryani got used to relying on him. In due course, they formed a close friendship.\nAfter a few months, Soryani proposed that they get married. She offered to convert to Abdul’s faith: Islam. Their simple, even modest, marriage solemnized by the Registrar contrasted sharply with Soryani’s first high-profile wedding. Only a few close family friends were invited. Looking awkward in his tuxedo, Abdul bestowed admiring glances on his elegantly dressed and beautifully made-up bride. As soon as they were back in the hotel, he changed back to his accustomed clothes.\n“So now everybody must call you Mr. Abdul,” Soryani told him as she stroked his arm.\n“But to you I shall always be Abdul,” he assured her.\nTo the outside world, Abdul continued to present the image of a bodyguard cum chauffeur. When on their own, they were a loving couple. To her own surprise, Soryani discovered she could be tender.\nOne morning Abdul informed Soryani that a Mr. Li and his son, Ahmad, had made an appointment to see her.\n“They are my father and half brother. I wonder what they are up to?”\n“We’ll soon know,” soothed Abdul, who was alarmed by the change in her expression.\n“Ahmad is a bully; I don’t like him,” she told her husband.\n“I’ll be in the next room. Ring the bell if there is problem.”\nMr. Li appeared punctually, accompanied by Ahmad and Guatama, the family’s lawyer. He asked Soryani to inject a substantial amount into the firm. It was facing hardship but a loan ought to see them through.\n“USD200,000 is a great deal of money,” reflected Soryani. “How will you pay me back? You say the business is failing?”\n“Our competitors undercut us all the time.”\n“Then why don’t you undercut them?”\n“We have high running expenses; it is impossible to lower prices.”\n“So how comes Ahmad just bought a posh Mercedes car and a Cadillac limousine?”\n“Representation expense; status symbol,” said Mr. Li unhappily.\n“Please send your account books to Mr. Rahmat – my legal adviser,” countered Soryani. “I have to know what is involved.”\n“But I already prepared the accounts,” interceded Guatama.\n“What is that credit described as ‘USD200,000’ fund injection,” asked Soryani after skimming through the balance sheet.\n“It’s the money you are going to inject. It’s your duty as a daughter. You just sign this cheque.”\n“No way,” she countered.\n“How dare you refuse to sign, Sis,” exclaimed Ahmad. Placing the cheque in front of her, he continued ominously: “Have you no loyalty to our family? Sign!”\nAs soon as Soryani rang the bell, Abdul made his appearance. Feeling secure in his presence, Soryani tore the cheque, and repeated: “You send the account books to Rahmat, Mr. Li.”\n“Mr. Li … ” he stuttered. “I’m your father!”\n“How kind of you to remember,” she responded.\n“And who is he,” asked Ahmad, pointing his finger at Abdul.\n“My friend and husband,” she affirmed.\n“You married without father’s consent?” expostulated Guatama. “It’s against Chinese custom and tradition.”\n“Under Indonesian law, the father’s consent to a marriage is not needed if the bride has reached the age of majority. I have. And I have converted to Islam. I am now a Muslim, like my husband.”\n“Converted without father’s consent or advice?” stammered an aghast Guatama.\n“I used my own judgment! And you mind your own business, Mr. Guatama,” she snapped at him. Turning to Abdul, who was looking tensely at Guatama and Ahmad, she concluded: “These people are leaving. Please show them out. If you, Mr. Li, want my help, send the company’s books to Rahmat. I’ll contact you when I have studied his report.”\nThe next meeting took place some three weeks later. Once again, Mr. Li insisted on bringing Ahmad and Guatama with him. Seated beside Soryani were Rahmat and Abdul.\n“Your firm is insolvent, Mr. Li,” started Soryani. “Ahmad is incompetent and a bad manager.”\n“Ahmad is a brilliant businessman,” interjected Guatama. “Here: you just sign cheque.”\n“I advise you not to,” said Rahmat. “An injection of money into a bankrupt firm is pointless.”\n“Precisely,” she agreed, and tore the new cheque that had been proffered to her.\n“So, you do not give us a loan,” complained Mr. Li. “So it’s best to go to a bank.”\n“Please do,” grinned Soryani.\n“What do you suggest?” asked Ahmad.\n“I’ll buy the business for what it is worth!”\n“Here sign the cheque!” speaking exuberantly, Guatama wrote out a new cheque. “USD200,000: fair price and Ahmad runs the business well. Teach you and make you rich soon! Very wise decision!”\n“Shut up,” Soryani displayed her irritation. “The business is bust; it’s not worth 200,000 dollars. Mr. Li.: I’ll pay you USD15,000.00 for it. Ahmad can keep his expensive cars. I understand they are registered in his name. I’ll pay you the price after both of you have resigned from the Board of Directors and transferred all shares.”\n“Ridiculous offer,” yelled Guatama. He was about to add a few words of protest but checked himself as he noted Abdul hostile glance.\n“It is rather low,” Mr. Li spoke soberly.\n“Take it or leave it,” replied Soryani.\nFollowing two days of haggling, Soryani raised her offer to USD20,000.00 and agreed to pay Mr. Li a monthly allowance of USD2,500.00. Rejecting her father’s suggestion that the preparation of the contract be entrusted to Guatama, she advised that her lawyer, Rahmat, would be appointed the firm’s new legal adviser. The services of his predecessor were no longer required.\n“How about me?” asked Ahmad.\n“We are told you are a brilliant businessman. Surely, one of your many friends will offer you a suitable job.” Ahmad did not reply.\nShortly after the execution of the documents, Soryani invited Bambang over to her place. When the polite small talk had been concluded, Soryani told him about her purchase of the family business.\n“How much are you paying for it?” he asked with concern.\n“USD20,000.00,” she confided. “My original offer was USD15,000.00 but they kept haggling. So, I raised it.”\n“Who perused the accounts?”\n“My own lawyer: Rahmat,” she grinned.\n“Good. Guatama, their ‘family-lawyer’, is a scoundrel. In his capacity as Honorary Secretary of the firm he approved your bother’s purchase of expensive cars with the firm’s money.”\n“Did you have a falling out with them?” she wanted to know.\n“I did. I severed my contact with the firm.”\n“Would you like to buy it over. You can have it for what I paid plus USD3,000.00 for my ‘trouble’.”\n“I don’t want to have anything to do with your father and brother, Soryani.”\n“Both have tendered their resignations; they are out! And Bambang, I know who their competitors are. If one group owns both firms, it will have an effective monopoly.”\nHaving had a brief consultation with his partners, Bambang accepted the offer. Points of contract were signed there and then. Before he left, he told Soryani she had lost weight and that her voice was hoarse.\n“It’s just a touch of ‘flu,” she shrugged.\n“How long you had it?”\n“A few weeks.”\n“You better see a doctor, Soryani.”\nSoryani’s physician prescribed some lozenges and a cough mixture. As the symptoms did not abate, Soryani made a second appointment. Events at home, though, prevented her from keeping it.\nOne evening, as Soryani was getting ready to retire, she was surprised to hear moans and groans coming from Abdul’s room, which was adjacent to her own bedroom. When she entered, she found him writhing in pain, his brow covered with sweat.\n“What is it, Abdul?” she asked with concern.\n“Oh, just little bit of pain,” he gave her the marriage smile. “I’m sure it’ll pass tomorrow.”\n“You had it before?” she persisted.\n“Oh, a few times, off and on.”\n“Where is it?” she asked with growing alarm.\n“Here,” Abdul pointed at his abdomen. “But Soryani: it’s nothing. Don’t you worry.”\nWhen told the symptoms, her physician insisted that Abdul be rushed over to emergency. It sounded like a severe attack of appendicitis. Throughout the harassing ambulance trip, Soryani kept mopping Abdul’s brow. Smiling gratefully, he assured her again ‘it was nothing’.\nThe hospital’s surgeon disagreed, diagnosing a burst appendix. Within half an hour of his arrival in emergency, Abdul was in the operating room.\n“You are a wonderful wife,” he told Soryani as he was being wheeled in. “I love you very much.”\n“And you, Abdul, are the best husband wife can hope for.”\n“Thanks,” he replied gratefully; “and you take care Soryani; you better go home and rest.”\nSoryani waited anxiously in the anteroom. After some two hours, the surgeon emerged with a strained and worn-out face. Abdul had a chance. His robust constitution enabled him to survive the peritonitis operation. The next few days were bound to be crucial. To save Soryani the need of shuttling between her home and the hospital, she was allocated a spare room in the building.\nAbdul lingered for three days. Most of the time he was in a coma. When he regained consciousness for a short while, he smiled at his wife and stroked her hand. He then closed his eyes again and soon gave up the ghost.\nA few weeks later, the doctor referred Soryani to a specialist. A methodical medical examination and ultrasound radiology confirmed she was suffering from cancer of the larynx. His diagnosis was confirmed by a renowned Ear, Nose and Throat specialist in Singapore. In his opinion, a complete removal of the larynx was imperative. It meant Soryani would lose her voice.\nBack in Medan, the local specialist thought there was no need for complete removal. A skilful operation might preserve Soryani’s voice. Hoping for the best, Soryani decided to go ahead with him.\nOriginally, it all seemed well. Soryani regained her voice in no time and, being a determined woman, proceeded with business as usual. Then, after some six months, she became hoarse again. A few cancer tissues, not removed by the local surgeon, had grown and spread. The specialists in both Medan and Singapore advised that hospitalisation and chemotherapy presented the only hope for her survival.\nThis time Soryani opted for Singapore. When she failed to respond to the treatment, she was transferred to the XX Ward.\n“So now you know Soryani’s story,” concluded Theophil.\n“The cute little princess of Medan,” I retorted.\n“Who existed only in the eye of the beholder,” chuckled my friend. “Well, Peter’le, if you had my powers, would you have intervened to save Soryani?”\n“I don’t think so,” I conceded after some reflection. “Her life had run its course. I might have nudged Abdul to seek medical help before it was too late.”\n“But Peter’le, can you be certain that he and Soryani would have continued to enjoy a happy marriage? Would he have remained satisfied with his role and public image?”\n“Hard to know,” I concluded. “But you have prescience. Couldn’t you discern the answer?”\n“Prescience enables you to determine what is to happen if events are left alone. It is impossible to predict the effect of a ‘change in the chain of events’.”\n“And, when there is room for doubt and uncertainty, it’s best to remain in the background.”\n“Precisely,” he approbated. “You see, Susan was still looking forward to the future. In contrast, Bachan and Soryani had had their respective heydays. And you, Peter’le, have benefited from the learning curve assigned to you.”\nNext morning Pat arrived early. After a while, she went over to Soryani’s room. When she came back to mine, she confirmed the patient’s identity and told me she had just died.\n“Did she remember us?” I wanted to know.\n“Yes. She had not forgotten your compliment. And she wanted to know if you got used to spicy dishes.”\n“That will be the day,” chuckled Theophil.\n“She was so happy when I told her you still had the elephant,” concluded Pat.\nPat kept me company till late in the afternoon. She left my room when a physiotherapist came to impart his pearls of wisdom but returned to the room when a dietician came over to instruct us on some new discoveries on foodstuffs.\nDischarge When Pat departed from my sick room in the ward, Theophil made his appearance in the form of Father José.\n“So, Peter’le, Soryani remembered your compliment. I suspect it was one of the few happy moments of her childhood.”\n“Where will she be buried?” I wanted to know.\n“You’ll be surprised. Bambang is coming over to take the body back to Medan. Mr. Li is too frail to fly. Ahmad has migrated.”\n“All the same, Soryani’s funeral is bound to be quite a family affair,” I guessed. “Poor Bachan’s funeral must be far more modest. Nobody remembers him!”\n“You’re wrong there,” contradicted Theophil. “Here, have a look.”\nBachan’s remains had been placed in an elegant coffin. His body had been cleansed and made up. A green turban adorned his head. To my surprise, he looked like Bachan of old: not like the invalid I had cheered up in the ward. Another aging, sparse but still energetic looking, man acted as the master of ceremonies.\n“Simon?” I asked my mentor.\n“Who else?” he affirmed. “And look at the list of signatures in the book.”\n“It looks as if all his old classmates and friends from the Hall have congregated for the occasion,” I let my surprise show.\n“Actually, Peter’le, all of them remembered Bachan. True, nobody offered him a job; not with his tarnished reputation. But quite a few of them donated money when Simon passed the hat around to help Bachan.”\n“What a strange mode of conduct,” I grumbled.\n“But what would you have done in their place?”\n“Actually, the very same,” I had to concede.\n“You see, the high horse is more readily preached than mounted!”\nTheophil’s philosophy – his approach to life – was now clear. All the same, one question remained unanswered. Why had he been so kind and considerate to me all my life. I knew I did not have a strong character. In many delicate situations, I had been unable to make up my mind and kept going forward and backward. Would I have been able to take prompt and appropriate action if I had met a fate like Bachan’s or Soryani’s?\n“Don’t you underrate yourself, Peter’le,” rebuked Theophil. “All in all, you are one of most resilient survivors I have come across. I remember how you attended meetings, even conducted legal cases, amidst severe attacks of asthma. But this resilience, of course, is not my reason for stepping in when needed. I gave you a clue, remember?”\n“I worked that out two days ago …”\n“I know,” he interspersed, “but you were unable to take it much further. Well, why don’t you have another go?”\nOnce again, I concentrated on the clue. My own feelings for Theophil were readily explainable. As a young boy – and right into my teens – the only person I had loved with all my heart had been my late father. I had trusted him implicitly, considered his interests priority to my own and was always keen to please him.\n“Which instinct triggered this feeling?” asked Theophil.\n“I suspect my survival instinct.”\n“Precisely,” he affirmed. “The shattering of your Viennese world, the vagaries of a refugee’s existence – all these underscored the safety and feeling of security provided by your father’s figure. Your mother was unable to invoke these feelings of dependence which mattered so much to you.”\nHe was right. Even later in life, when a difficult marriage threatened my sanity and very existence, I kept turning to my father for advice and help. His death – when I was in my early forties – had hit me hard.\nFor years I felt friendless and cut off. Then, one bright day when I was in London on business, my feet led me to a small shop in Kensington High Street. A nudge prompted me to look carefully at the items in the show window. I entered and, to my surprise, met my late father’s boyhood friend, Peppi Stölzl, who owned the shop.\nPeppi and I became close friends. To see him as often as possible, I flew regularly to London, ignoring my wife’s objections and protests. Before long, I felt for Peppi the very deep love and loyalty I had for my late father.\n“You knew who was behind Peppi,” averred Theophil.\n“True. But ‘know’ is a difficult word,” I told him.\n“You have even learnt how to use my twists and tactics,” he grinned.\n“But, surely, Theophil, I kept doubting your existence until you revealed yourself to me in full regalia. Still, I had sensed all along that, if a metaphysical being existed, it was ‘behind’ Peppi. And I had surmised that, in that event, Peppi would be non other than your alter ego.”\n“Which did not stop you from developing love and affection for him.”\n“Precisely,” I agreed. “But how does all this affect your position or reaction to a mortal like me?”\n“Over the years, Peter’le, I insisted I was incapable of emotions. This is true in the sense that I have no physical impulses or desires. But I have already conceded that I, too, can ‘feel’!”\n“But where does this take us …” I started; and then, abruptly, saw light.\n“So now you understand,” he said with satisfaction. “As you know, I exist in another dimension. Generally, I am not affected by feelings or desires common to members of your world. But no being – even if he exists in another dimension – would sidestep or dismiss out of hand a genuine affection which he can relate to. And you, Peter’le, transferred to me your feelings for your father.”\n“Yes; I see it now,” I told him in a voice charged with emotions. “Yes, I do see. But Theophil, you have looked after me all my life. How could you have known, when you first set eyes on me, what sort of emotions I would experience many years later on?”\n“That, Peter’le, is prescience. If events are not twisted, it holds true.”\n“So now, all is clear,” I assured him. “And Theophil, the dimensions we have been talking about are inter-linked – not mutually segregated.”\n“Of course not,” he conceded. “Otherwise, how would I be able, or motivated, to observe and study your dimension; and how could you sense – even if not ‘know’ – that I am in existence?”\n“I am trying to understand,” I assured him. Then, placing my hand in his, added: “And thanks for everything you have done for me over the years; my friend.”\n“It has always been a pleasure,” he assured me.\nNext morning, shortly before lunch, the ward doctor signed my discharge. When we emerged from the building, there was no taxi at the stand. Dismayed by the prospect of a long wait, I stared in front of me nervously. At that very moment, a taxi pulled up beside us and its auto-door opened invitingly. As soon as we fastened the seat belts and gave him the address, the driver took the quickest route to our place.\nWhen we arrived, he insisted on helping us with the bag, containing the few belongings I had taken with me to the hospital, and accompanied us up the stairs. Thanking Pat profusely for the token tip, he winked and then closed the entrance door behind him. As I looked through the peep hole, there was, of course, nobody there.\n“Gave you a start, didn’t I” Theophil chuckled.\n“You did, rather.”\n“And what do you say now about your week in the ward.”\n“A splendid break – comfortable and instructive.”\n“Glad you see it this way.”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novels/theophil/part-2/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"susan\"\u003eSusan\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA spacious room with an attached bathroom; the furniture, too, was up to standard.

The first chapter describes Job’s piety and orthodoxy and then refers to the day on which ‘the sons of god’ congregated in His front. It adds that ‘Satan’ came with them and that he questioned the motive of Job’s piety, alleging that it was due to the protection and prosperity conferred on him by divinity. Satan says that if these were taken from Job, he would curse God ‘to [His] face’.\nIn this manner, Satan challenges God to a bet respecting Job’s motivation. This, though, ought really to have been clear to God! Another passage of the MT advises that “a man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart” [Sam. I. 16:7].\nAll the same – and notwithstanding the ensuing misery that would follow – God accepts the bet. He permits Satan to try Job, whereupon a series of disasters destroy Job’s prosperity. Notably, his sons and daughters also perish. Job withstands these calamities and actually praises the Lord.\nIn the next chapter, the sons of God and Satan presents themselves again before the Almighty, who tells Satan that Job has remained pious notwithstanding his misfortune and says to Satan that “thou did move me against him, to destroy him without cause” [2:3].1 Satan replies that Job’s stand would change if God touched his bone and flesh. In this manner, Satan seeks to extend the bet he made with God. The latter grants Satan the required permission but orders Satan to spare Job’s soul (meaning life). Satan thereupon smites Job “with vile soars from the sole of his foot to his crown” [2:7].\nAt this stage, Job’s wife counsels him to curse God and die. Job refuses and scolds her. We are told that “[i]n all this [Job] did not sin with his lips” [2:10].\nThereafter Job’s three friends, namely Elifaz [Eliphas], Bildad and Zofar “come to mourn with him and to comfort him” [2:11]. The ensuing debates between Job and his friends about divine justice take place in his house or, in other words, inter partem.\nThese debates (and Elihu’s speeches) are followed by God’s Replies from the Whirlwind [Caps. 38 – 42:6]. In the epilogue, which is expressed in the same prose style as the prologue, God tells Elifaz that the three comrades “have not spoken of me the thing that is right, like my servant” [42:7] Job and instructs them to entreat Job to ‘pray for’ them, viz. to induce God to forgive them.\nThe epilogue ends with God restoring Job to his wealth and position. Job lives to ripe old age and is blessed to see four generations of offspring.\nThe prologue and epilogue give rise to a number of issues. First and foremost, they do not make any reference to Elihu, who is, thus, not foreshadowed in the setting of the work.\nSecond, Job’s sons and daughters are considered part and parcel of Job’s prosperity. God sanctions their demise at the hand of Satan, although there is no hint that they deserve this harsh treatment. It is true that, when Job is restored to his erstwhile position, he is blessed with fresh sons and daughters. It is, at the same time, noteworthy that those who perished were not brought back to life. In reality, the harsh fate of Job’s original sons and daughters would be condemned by Jeremiah and Ezekiel,2 who took the view that the sins of the fathers ought not to be visited on their sons. A fortiori, they would be perplexed by the demise of Job’s offspring in a mere attempt to test his piety.\nThird, the MT version does not describe Satan as ‘evil’. He is an accuser and doubter, who ascribes mean motives to people.3 He acts only when granted permission by the Almighty. Still, the LXX and the late Targum refer to him as a source of evil. In this manner, these texts accommodate the view taken of Satan by Orthodox Judaism during the height of the Second Temple period.\nFourth, the MT version refers to the sons of God. Such an anthropomorphic designation was not acceptable to later Jewish Orthodoxy. Accordingly, the late Targum refers to the sons of the angels. The LXX simply refers to the Lord’s angels, whose presence appears also in books of the prophets.4\nRegrettably, the extant portion of the Qumran Scroll does not comprise the prologue. In contrast, part of the epilogue has survived.5 All in all, it may be surmised that right from the beginning the ‘setting’ has been part of Job. This assumption leads to the next question, viz. when was the setting composed: was it written prior to the composition of the MT version or was it composed by the anonymous author of the debates?\nThe prevailing view is that the legend, in which Job remains patient and penitent throughout his ordeal, is antique and was used by the anonymous author of the MT version. Presumably, in the fable Job speaks about the greatness of the Lord and his friends express doubts.\nNotably, Greenstein and Newsom refer to some legends reminiscent of Job.6 Indeed, the story of the penitent Job, narrated in the prologue, has been found in Mesopotamian sources.7 However, when looked at carefully, no text is in pari materia with the MT version. The ancient texts discuss the theodicy issue from the viewpoint of a society with a polytheistic religion. The hero (akin to Job) often wonders which deity he has offended. This issue does not arise in Job. Here the hero believes in a single God. In reality, the Mesopotamian sources do not include an analysis of the theodicy issue against a monotheistic background. Admittedly, Job is mentioned as praiseworthy by Ezekiel [14:14, 20], who likens him to Noah. There is, at the same time, no basis for the suggestion that Ezekiel was familiar with the highly articulated text here considered.\nThis analysis demonstrates that another explanation need be considered, viz. that the anonymous author, who composed the speeches, was familiar with Job of the Mesopotamian tales. He used the legend when composing the setting, but then embarked on a detailed discussion of the theodicy issue. In support of this argument, it is strongly arguable that the epilogue was meant to appear after chapter 31, which concludes with the words: “tamu divrei Iyyov [תמו דברי איוב]”, meaning “The words of [Job] are concluded” [31:40].\nIf this construction is accepted, then chapter 32-37 (Elihu’s speeches) and 38-42:1-6 [God’s Reply from the Whirlwind] are late additions. Actually, the epilogue is an appropriate sequel to the debate between Job and his three friends. It clarifies that the Almighty prefers Job’s honest attestations of his innocence – which is the gamut of the book – to the false accusations and the dogmatic stance of Elifaz, Bildad and Zofar.\nIn support of this construction, it is to be noted that God tells Elifaz that the speeches of the three friends were not 8נכונה {‘nechona’ viz., “the thing that is right” [42:7,8]}. The sins the friends attributed to Job were, of course, untrue whilst Job’s manifestation of his innocence was, as is clear from the setting, factual.\nUnless otherwise indicated, quotations are taken from the version of Harold Fisch appearing in Koren, The Jerusalem Bible, (Jerusalem, 2008).\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nJer. 32:2-3; Ezek, 18:2-3.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThis is also the role ascribed to him when mentioned elsewhere in the MT.

My motivation was simple. After almost fifty years with the law, I had no wish to tarnish my reputation by getting involved in a questionable case. Further, I was afraid of ending up with an omelette on my face.\nThe late Mr. Lim’s three sons were waiting for me when I arrived for the meeting, which took place in the unadorned conference room of the old law firm. Thomas emphasised that we were dealing with a ‘modest’ estate. Substantial expenditure was to be avoided. Initially, the estate had hope that the Bank would come up with a settlement. But up to now the Bank had taken a militant stand.\n“How much is involved?” I asked.\n“About $2.1m. was taken from the account,” explained Thomas.\n“From the Bank’s point of view such an amount is a pittance. Why did they refuse to refund? They would wish to avoid the publicity of a trial!”\n“The Branch’s Deputy Manager would not hear of a settlement. He is very stubborn.”\nI knew the officer involved – Quentin Tan – very well. At the time of the defalcations, he was a mere assistant Branch Manager. He had, since, been moved to an important position at the Head Office. I saw less of him after his rise. Before then we had even played together as a team in a Contract Bridge tournaments. He was a good and smart partner.\nIn my eyes Quentin was a reliable common-sense man and an experienced banker. He was bound to know that the payment of large amounts over the counter was unusual. A searching trial would not enhance the Bank’s reputation. What was the cause of his uncompromising stand? In my dealings with him – arising in the context of earlier trials – his basic philosophy was ‘live and let live’. He must have known – or perhaps only suspected – that the facts were not as simple as they appeared.\nMy meeting with Thomas and his clients, established that only the eldest son, Freddie, continued to live in old family home. His two brothers had moved out shortly after they married. Under the circumstances, it was not surprising that the house was left to Freddie. His two younger brothers did not resent this. Presumably, the deceased had given them substantial assistance when they bought their own houses. Still, the amount of about $2.1m. kept in the account was to be shared by them. All the same, none of them expressed outrage at Lena’s behaviour. Freddie even went so far as to relate that they kept visiting her in Changi prison.\n“But her dereliction has cost each of you a neat loss of $700,000. Of course, we hope to get it back from the Bank. But aren’t you outraged, or, in the very least, disillusioned?”\n“That would not help us to recover the money,” stepped in Freddie.\n“But where did it end up?”\n“In the ‘business’ of Lena’s friend. What is the point of digging?”\n“You could, for instance, trace it to the account of a loan shark. We would, then, stand a chance of getting it back under a special type of proceedings,” I explained to him.\n“But, surely, such proceedings would be very costly?”\n“I told them so,” interceded Thomas. “And it is a ‘modest estate’. We cannot afford risky proceedings.”\n“Still, how do we know that the money did not end up in an account of Lena and her friend. Actually, are you calling her as a witness?”\n“The clients do not want to do this. She is apparently undergoing a conversion. She sees a chaplain regularly.”\n“A prison conversion,” I muttered in disgust. “Well, what can I then do for you?”\n“We want to know if the terms and conditions are effective.”\n“But are they applicable? The late Mr. Lim opened his account with the branch long before it was taken over by the present bank. Did they ever communicate the terms to him?” I wanted to know.\n“They told him the terms could be perused at the premises of the branch!”\n“And that was all? Up to now I have never seen a person reading a long document, including a bank’s terms and conditions, displayed at a branch. And I have been in business of counselling banks for over fifty years! I would never have let a bank proceed on such a shaky basis! Do you, in the very least, have a copy of the letter advising the late Mr. Lim of his ‘duty’ to read the terms?”\n“I don’t; but they rely on a standard letter which, they say, was sent to persons in Mr. Lim’s position. It advised them about the merger and counselled that the applicable terms and conditions were displayed at the branch.”\n“How do you know this letter was actually sent to the late Mr. Lim?”\n“Please proceed on the basis that it was sent and that the terms were applicable.”\n“Very well,” I gave in ungracefully. “It will take me three days to write such an opinion. Your main question is whether the verification clause, under which the late Mr. Lim should have drawn any inaccuracies to the bank’s attention within 15 days, was effective?”\n“Precisely,” concluded Thomas, averting his eyes.\n“You see, Prof.” added Freddie, “ours is a ‘modest estate’. Our best hope is a settlement.”\n“It is up to you,” I conceded. “Still, I want to grasp how Lena knew, in advance, when to substitute the forged statements for the real ones. Further, who produced them? They look spotless and genuine to me.”\n“How can we tell?” asked Freddie.\n“By calling Lena as a witness and subjecting her to a searching cross- examination!”\n“The estate wants to avoid this,” explained Thomas. “I have been instructed me to this effect.”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ingenius-fraud/part-3/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eTo get a clear picture of the facts, I asked to have a meeting with Mr. Lim’s sons and heirs.

Vanishing Ink “Well, what has Hendra done now?” I wanted to know.\n“It all relates back to the consolidation of his accounts. You see, Peter, we have just received a remittance of S$500,000.”\n“Why not set the amount off against his debt?”\n“He has further instructed that S$400,000 be remitted to a numbered Swiss bank account. If we do so, the debt remaining after the consolidation and the remittance to Zurich will be some S$250,000,” advised Freddie.\n“Better than a debt of S$650,000,” noted Norbert.\n“I agree. But Peter, can we set-off?” asked Freddie.\n“Why ever not? Surely, the set-off letter is airtight. I have a copy on file!”\n“Have a look at the original.”\nWhen Norbert produced the original, which had been kept in the Bank’s vaults, my eyes opened wide. The text typed on the Bank’s premises had remained fresh and clear. The signatures, in contrast, had vanished. Hendra, Norbert explained, had used his own pen to sign the document. The Bank’s secretaries, who had witnessed his signature, had used the same pen. Mesmerised, I breathed on the blank paper, held it up against the light, and let my fingers travel over it: all to no avail. The signatures did not reappear.\n“We tried all that, Peter. We even summoned a specialist. He was prepared to give it a try. But the outcome is questionable. There are too many types of disappearing ink around. The signatures might be obliterated altogether if he went ahead.”\n“How did this trick happen?” I asked, bewildered.\n“I offered Hendra my own pen. He declined and insisted on using his, which – so he said – was the pen used by Sukarno when he executed the Treaty of Independence. I fell for it!”\n“I, too, would have fallen for it,” admitted Freddie. “The question is: what shall we do?”\nFor a few minutes I was lost in thoughts. To clear the picture, I asked Norbert whether he had been present when Hendra had signed. When he nodded, I wanted to know whether he could identify the secretaries who had witnessed the signatures. It turned out that both had left the Bank. Still, their signatures as witnesses were displayed in full in the copies.\nWhen I had digested the facts, I advised them to effect the set-off. If Hendra wanted them to remit any funds out, he would have to apply for a fresh overdraft. Norbert would know how to handle him.\n“But how about the blank original?” asked Norbert.\n“Freddie: what do you do when a document is lost or destroyed by accident, say, by fire?”\n“Under Australian law, we can ask for the court’s leave to prove it by submitting a copy verified by us as true.”\n“Our law is the same. I have a photocopy, and Norbert can confirm its authenticity. So go ahead and set-off!”\n2. The Verification Clause “And if Hendra makes a fuss?” asked Freddie.\n“Surely the Bank sent him monthly ‘statements of account’. I’m sure they include a ‘verification clause’.”\n“They do. The clause is further spelt out in the terms and conditions executed by him.”\n“If the worst comes to the worst, we can rely on them,” I assured them.\nThe verification clause referred to was a standard term and condition used by most banks in Singapore. Under it, the customer was given a period of seven or ten days to object to any incorrect or false entry. If he failed to so, the statement would become conclusive evidence of the existing balance. The validity of the clause had been upheld by local courts.\n“I think Peter’s right, Norbert. In any event, do you think Hendra would dare to unveil the nature of his business practices? Nobody would touch him with a bargepole if he became known as a conman. Unfortunately, there is a separate problem. We have discussed it.

Accordingly, the trial commenced at the prescribed date. As anticipated, Vollar took the stand as soon as his Counsel completed his opening address.\nUnder the rules of procedure then applicable in Western Australia, his Counsel took him through the facts of the case. It became clear that the business had failed and that Vollar had lost his investment and had made no earnings for months. In that regard, I felt considerable sympathy for him. Still, as the facts unfolded, I kept wondering why he had not taken professional advice before his injected his funds into the business. It was clear from the reference that, on occasions, the business exceeded the limits of its overdraft.\nWhat was Vollar’s motivation in acquiring part of the business? Further, was he really entitled to put full reliance on the lukewarm reference. In reply to a question put by the Judge, he had conceded that he had not been a customer of our Bank, let alone of the branch involved. Did our bank really owe him a duty to investigate?\nThe Judge, a portly Gentleman in his mid-fifties, announced a 40 minutes recess. Obviously, he needed a tea break. As we mulled out of the stuffy court room, I took note of two policemen who were accompanying a middle-aged man waiting in the ante-room. His right hand was cuffed to one of the policemen’s left hand. A well dressed and groomed woman in her mid thirties was sitting beside the man. I sensed instinctively that they were the original owners of the business, Yuri and Rena Katz.\nOne of the legal assistants explained to me that the Katzs had been served subpoenas in case one of the parties decided to call either of them. Obviously, the wife had been deprived of her husband’s company while he languid in prison. Had she found solace in someone else’s arms out of sheer boredom or, perhaps, out of need? The legal assistant’s wry smile indicated that he was aware of my reflections.\n“Where does Bruce Smith live?” I asked\n“Some ten minutes walk from the business” the legal assistant replied. Then, without further questions on my part he added conspiratorially, “Vollar lives a few blocks further away. His wife often returns to Belgium to visit her family.”\n“Is Bruce Smith, too, often on his own?”\n“I don’t know. But I hear that he has a stormy marriage.”\nWhen court resumed, Jack Wilson, rose to cross-examine. I had last seen him during his last year in Victoria University of Wellington.

Usually, they obtained valuations prepared by the personnel of their own bank.”\n“What then was the purpose of a bank’s reference?”\n“To gauge whether or not to proceed and to get some assessment of the standing of the counter party.”\n“So, the bank reference would be a first step – nothing more?”\n“True”, conceded Vollar with ill grace. He then added in haste: “But of course a Belgian would expect that a reference would be honest. I also believe that he is entitled to rely on a duty of care owed to him as a customer.”\nEveryone present knew he had walked into a trap. Hastily, his own Counsel rose to point out that he had not called Vollar as an expert on Belgian banking law or practice. He had no objection to the exclusion of the second sentence from the record. Jack Wilson countered that the that he had no objection to the answer being accepted. He then turned back to Vollar, who was patently agitated, and asked pointedly:\n“Mr. Vollar, were you at any time a customer of my clients. Did you have an account with them or any other dealings?”\n“I thought they owed a duty of care to any member of the public.”\n“That is a point to be argued by Counsel,” interceded the Judge. “Please answer the question put to you. Were you at any time the Defendants’ customer?”\n“Not really, Your Honour.”\n“Did you have any dealings with them except as regards this reference?” pressed Jack Wilson.\n“No, I did not.”\nJack Wilson suppressed a grin. It was now established that Vollar had never been our Bank’s customer. Any point concerning the Bank’s duty to a member of the public was a point of law. Referring to it in the cross-examination would have been a gross error. Jack was too smart to make any legal point at this stage. Instead, he grilled Vollar on the contents of what he had been told.\n“Mr. Vollar, did you read the reference carefully?”\n“I did indeed.”\n“It mentions that, occasionally, the business exceeded that limits of the overdraft granted to it.”\n“I concluded from this that the business required a cash injection.”\n“Did the reference revert to this point?”\n“It did no. It was my own conclusion.”\n“Based on your own assessment?”\n“And on what Yuri Katz told me.”\n“So, you knew Mr. and Mrs. Katz before you went ahead with the investment?”\n“Actually, I had met them before I saw their advertisement in the papers. I had a talk with Mr. Katz next day.”\n“You just went to the business for a chat?”\n“Actually, I had known them for a quite sometime. I often had a snack at their counter.”\n“Why then did you need a reference?”\n“To make sure my assessment was correct. And the reference encouraged me.”\n“Although you were told that the business had gone beyond the limits of their facilities?”\n“The general tone of the reference was favourable.”\n“But did the reference tell you the business was profitable?”\n“My talks with the Katzs suggested it was.”\nI looked at Jack anxiously. He was treading on thin ice. He had laid his foundation that Vollar had gone ahead with open eyes. What more was he hoping to establish at this stage?\nJack must have taken the same view. After a short reflection he adjusted his gown and turned to the final – perhaps even crucial – point.\n“And, Mr. Vollar, this reference was given to you on the clear understanding that the Bank assumed no liability?”\n“I disagree.”\n“I put it to you that a disclaimer of liability had been read out to you!”\n“It was not,” protested Vollar, “not according to my notes”!\n“But you have not produced your notes, Mr. Vollar. The reference spelt out in your Statement of Claim is based on a sheet of paper produced by you!”\n“It is the typed version composed from the notes I took when the clerk read me out the reference.”\n“And you did not leave out anything?”\n“I did not!”\n“How then did you know the reference was composed by the branch manager?”\n“The clerk told me so when she read out the reference.”\n“Why then does her advice on this point not appear in your printed version of her communication?”\n“I thought the point was mundane or standard,” answered a much deflated Vollar.\n“So, you left it out!”\n“I did. I saw no point in reproducing it.”\n“And the same applies to any term except to the substance of what you were told, doesn\u0026rsquo;t it?!”\nVollar did not reply. Before his Counsel had the chance to raise an objection, Jack Wilson shrugged his shoulders, said he had no further questions and resumed his seat. Vollar’s Counsel tried to clear the record by asking whether Vollar would have referred in his notes to any disclaimer read out to him. Vollar assured the Judge he would have recorded it. The Judge looked at him narrowly. He then rose for the lunch break.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/matter-of-opinion/part-3/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAn attempt to mediate appeared futile.

Eventually, I recalled it when I walked up the stairs leading to the library mezzanine. Out of sheer curiosity I rang Robert up when I was back in my room. To my surprise, he had not changed his statement of claim. Further, he had no raised a count based on a mistake.\n“But, Robert, haven’t you acquired a copy of the certificate about the mare?”\n“Our solicitors did not manage to get it. Actually, the sale house’s defence is sparse. Their solicitors have denied the claims made by us. Do you want to see what they have submitted?”\nIt was clear from the pleading that the auctioneers decided to treat the case as turning on the facts. They denied that the mare “was not as described in the catalogue”, added that the plaintiff was, in any event, not entitled to rely on it and, as expected, denied that any certificate at variance with the catalogue description had been produced. Robert had not filed a reply. To my mind the issues had crystallised in an unfavourable manner. Robert would have to establish the existence of the certificate. How was he going to do that?\n“The Court is bound to believe my client. Jack Smith is a respectable person.”\n“But how about the sales house. You told me they were highly reputable.”\n“But this time they erred! The auctioneer they used - Douglas brown – is not a horse breeder and knows nothing about them!”\nRobert was not keen to engage is an argument. So, I decided to keep my silence. But I had a bad feeling.\nA further glance at the pleadings exacerbated my forebodings. Generally, lawyers fall into two groups. The first enjoyed fine legal points and thrived on theory. Robert was one of them. The other group comprised non-nonsense men, who would concentrate on the facts and seek to score with simple, common sense, arguments. Thomas Bardwell – Robert’s opponent – fell into this group. He was also known as a sharp – often unscrupulous – cross-examiner.\nNaturally, I appreciated that the classification of lawyers into such two groups was not conclusive. Most lawyers were intelligent professionals, who knew when to concentrate on legal point and when to fight a case of its ‘merits’ (facts). After a while, though, most lawyers tended to acquire a reputation for their skills in working out their tactics and approaches to a case. The ones most in demand had proved their skills both in taking up points of law and in arguments respecting facts. Neither Robert nor Thomas had attained such an outstanding reputation.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/catalogue-description/part-3/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eFor a while, I heard no more about the case and, actually, it skipped my mind.

Despite its plain nature, the case had some perplexing angles. Rotem’s offer of a pension was attractive. Simha had been a salaried employee all his life. By the time of the accident, he was getting close to retirement. What then induced him to prefer a lump sum. I was also puzzled by his rush to save the neck of another. Why should a street wise operator take a risk of this sort?\nPicador correspondence with Boaz Tamir got me nowhere. After a consultation with Rachel, I took matters a step further.\n“It’s you, Eli,” chuckled Boaz as soon as we were connected. “I wondered how long it would take you to establish informal contact!”\n“You, too, ‘Brutus’ have a ‘phone? Or was Your Lordship too busy to dial?”\n“Now, now, Eli: sarcasm won’t get us anywhere. I waited to see how long it would take you to appreciate that manoeuvrings were pointless! Still, let’s discuss the case over lunch.”\nBoaz, who arrived before me, had ordered a splendid array of Eastern dishes. We threw ourselves on them. When we finished, Boaz wiped his mouth and grinned with satisfaction: “Well, Eli: what’s on your mind? I take it this conversation is off the record?”\n“Of course, Boaz; and – to start – we are not at odds this time. Rotem and Solbon are prepared to be generous: you know this!”\n“I’m not surprised: it’s an ugly case!”\n“It is: that’s why we have admitted liability. But why has your client declined the indexed pension plus the job we’ve offered him? Don’t you agree it’s a decent offer?”\n“I do. But the matter is not in my hands, Eli; perhaps not even in Simha’s!”\n“I don’t get it!”\n“Simha’s first born, Shimon, who is about to finish business school, fancies himself a great businessman. He thinks he can put a lump sum to good use!”\n“In these days?” I asked, taken aback.\nBoaz did not reply. Like myself, he knew our young State was going through a difficult period. We had lost our Middle Eastern export markets as well as our sources of cheap raw materials and food. Supplies were rationed, the black market was booming and honest, well established, businesses were going bust every day. Law firms, too, struggled to remain afloat. Only the toughest and the fittest – or those with desirable connections – were doing well. The chances of a young entrepreneur were questionable. My personal chats with Boaz about our proposed partnership took this fact into account. Boaz was keenly aware of the risk to be faced by all new law firms.\nAverting his eyes, he conceded: “I talked to Shimon but it ain’t no good. The chap bustles with self confidence!”\n“Have you talked to Simha’s wife?”\n“Malka Balani is a traditional Oriental wife. She’s terrified of stepping between Simha and his first born. She hopes I’ll persuade the two of them. She doesn’t think much of Shimon!”\n“So, what’s to be done?” I asked.\n“Do you really want to settle?”\n“I do. But hate the thought of a generous lump sum being frittered away.”\n“Then we must have a last go: a meeting of the Balanis with Israel Silver, Jacob Keren and the two of us. See if you can sweeten the offer further: even if just by a token. I need ammunition.”\n“Very well,” I said, adding: “Strange how all of us feel sympathy for Simha.”\n“Mainly because of the injury not pleaded in the Statement of Claim,” pointed out Boaz.\nHis words struck a bell. I knew that Simha’s general loss of mobility and control over every-day bodily functions inflicted great sufferings. But the loss of a facility which forms part of a Man’s masculine pride appeared more depressing than the rest.\n“Actually, why did you not plead it?” I asked.\n“He refused to hear of it: said it was too shameful!”\n“What did Mrs. Balani say?”\n“She is taking it philosophically. Simha has a son and a daughter by his first wife and Malka presented him with a cute baby boy some two years ago. They can’t afford to feed more mouths and their community does not practice birth control. They’ve kept sort of apart. She thinks this injury is – to use her own words – not as terrible as the others.”\n“I suspect many women would see it this way. Actually, Rachel felt no sympathy for Simha. She dislikes his ‘kind’.

As we went again through the facts, we concluded the accident had been triggered off by a fault in the machine. Still, in an action against the manufacturers it would hard to establish the fault. We preferred a suit against Wollor – the local firm – provided Rotem admitted liability. The question was how to persuade it.\nIn the ultimate, it was an open-ended issue. Wolf’s record with the insurers would, undoubtedly, be a relevant fact. So would the orientation of Rotem’s personnel in charge. In this regard, both Rachel and I had some hope. Any decision of the Board of Directors would depend on a recommendation of the in-house lawyers. We knew both well and so embarked on an assessment of their likely reaction.\nThe senior in-house lawyer, Ruth Schwartz, had done her pupillage in Jacob Keren’s firm and for a while worked with him. She was not deterred by hard work and by Keren’s exacting demands. Work had become her utmost priority. What perturbed her were Keren’s derogatory remarks about the Yekkes – the German Jews. Initially, Ruth tolerated the outbursts of her East European employer. But after one particularly disparaging remark, she handed in her resignation.\nHannah Hod, who had been my team leader before Rachel joined our firm, was yet another Yekke. But unlike Ruth, she shrugged Keren’s tirades off as if they were outbursts of an uncouth child. What broke her back was the pressure of the long hours of work and the exacting demands involved in handling cases with Keren. Being, like myself, an asthmatic, she lacked the required robustness. In addition, she was bringing up her daughter single handed. When Ruth Schwartz offered her a post, she grabbed it.\nI knew that, left to their own, both would try to help our pretty client. Behind the disguise of her cold front, Ruth Schwartz hid a warm and kindly heart. Hannah, who was a strong willed and blunt lawyer in court, was a softy. She would identify with poor Dahlia and would look for legitimate grounds to induce Rotem to do the right thing.\n“I think, Rachel, our true problem is Ben Zion. He is a stickler to the rules. He is not a bad chap. But he will suppress any sentimental urge”.\n“You are right there. But we do have one further problem!”\n“Oh?”\n“Jacob Keren, my pet.

In due course, Kadmon’s secretary handed me the documents received in respect of Omri Tal’s claim . To my delight, Boaz Tamir had stepped into my trap. The verbose documents served on us had been prepared with a view to confusing Kadmon. They failed to state a plain ‘case’ as was appropriate for a skirmish with down to earth protagonists like Hannah and me. Suppressing a malicious grin, I retired to my office to prepare our response.\nThe main object of the Rules of Court was to achieve clarity in pleadings and to combat surprises and sharp practices. To this end, the plaintiff had to file a ‘Statement of Claim’, setting out the facts of his case, the formal ground on which he based his claim (known as the ‘cause of action’) and his ‘prayer’ or, in other words, the remedy for which he applied. The defendant, in turn, was expected to file an equally clear and detailed ‘Defence’.\nBoth documents had to spell out full details respecting each point. If, for instance, the victim of a running down case averred that the driver had been negligent, he had to provide particulars of the negligence alleged by him. If, in his Defence, the driver claimed that the victim had been equally careless, he, too, had to furnish full details.\nIf either party’s pleadings failed to meet the mark, the other party was entitled to demand ‘Further and Better Particulars’. The ostensible object of such an application was to force the evasive party to show his hand and to nail him down. In real life, though, such applications were often utilised as a delaying tactic. In theory, a case could be set down for its hearing as early as thirty days following the last exchange of pleadings. That stage, however, was not reached until all relevant particulars and details had been provided. A request for further particulars could readily buy the applicant six weeks of grace and, if his opponent decided to respond by filing a similar application of his own, the trial would, usually, be delayed by at least three or even four months.\nBoaz’s Statement of Claim left the door wide open for such manoeuvres. In one clause, for instance, he asserted that Solomon Vered had driven his truck in a “reckless manner devoid of any consideration for the safety of others”. Utilising the strict Rules of Court, I asked, first, for details of Solomon’s alleged recklessness and, secondly, demanded to know what measures of safety he should have observed “in consideration of the safety of others”. In another clause, Boaz averred that Solomon had undertaken his last trip for the day in “blatant defiance of the elementary guidelines on driving shifts”. Seeking to get matters straight, I asked ‘my Learned Friend’ to cite the guidelines in point. Boaz, who had anticipated that his high flying rhetoric would drive Abraham Kadmon to a quick and favourable settlement, was going grind his teeth when he encountered our dispassionate reaction.\nIt took me two days to draft my Application for Further and Better Particulars. The end product comprised 120 queries. I then drafted our Defence, leaving Boaz ample opportunity to demand further particulars on our contentions respecting Omri Tal’s own carelessness, technically described as ‘contributory negligence’. Boaz was certain to bite and, in this way, make room for another six or seven weeks of delay. Once these skirmishes were over, the courts would be getting ready for their summer recess. The case would, obviously, have to be set down for trial in the next session.\nAs was common in those days, my initial drafts had been illegible scribbles. My immediate task was to transform them for submission. In an era in which word-processors were still the subject of science fiction and in which only senior executives were equipped with dictating machines, the exercise required skill, patience and stamina. My first step was to transcribe my untidy notes into neat pages written in as clear a handwriting as I could command. It took one of our secretaries three days to type them.\nTwo days after Hannah returned to the office from her spell in the dental laboratory, we had our strategy meeting with Jacob Keren. Having regard to the nature of case, there was no need for the ceremony. Hannah was an experienced court room gladiator, and I could be trusted to lay the legal foundations soundly and carefully. Keren, though, reserved to himself the right to say the last word in every matter. His philosophy on this point was, in the ultimate, commendable: he was the head and sole proprietor of Jacob Keren \u0026amp; Associates. A blemish on its record was bound to stain his own impeccable record. He was not prepared to take such a risk!\nSnug in his opulent leather chair by the huge, neatly kept, desk, Jacob Keren’s sharp eyes watched the two of us keenly.\n“Excellent detective work, Hannah. Our Omri Tal doesn’t have to stand when he’s at work. He can sit down and still function efficiently. What a stroke of good luck to find out that three excellent dental technicians in Tel Aviv do their work from a wheelchair!”\n“Still, his new work technique will slow him down for a while,” Hannah commented judiciously.\n“For a year?”\n“A year or two. He’ll get used to the new pattern of work gradually. Sachs was working again at full speed two years after his spinal injury.”\n“And what do you say about the liability?” Keren asked me.\n“I still think it’s about fifty-fifty. Omri could have got a new battery for his torch before he rode to the club. There are three hardware shops on the way. But Vered could have taken the well lit road instead of the dark and narrow lane; and he knew he was tired!”\n“We’ll settle on 50-50 liability for his loss of future earnings. The problem is our Valentino’s loss of enjoyment of life: his dancing career has come to an abrupt end! That’s our Achilles heel!”\n“Surely, we’ll tell him to concentrate on his second hobby – you must have seen Ratosh’s note?” said Hannah.\n“I have,” grunted Keren. “And you did the right thing when you followed up the trail. But do you think the information is helpful?”\n“Why not?” Hannah tried to sound adamant. “Ratosh says Omri Tal played fifth and fourth board in tournaments of the Emanuel Lasker Club. I’ll try to convince our Omri, in cross, that with extra time at hand he can end up as first board!”\n“What do you think, Eli? You play chess. Well, what are Omri’s chances? Ratosh says Omri is good at openings but freaks out in the middle game. What do you make of this?”\n“Excellent memory but poor strategy and initiative. Not the type of chap who rises to first or even second board.”\n“So, his prospects at chess are nothing like his record as an amateur dancer!” Keren summed up.\n“Perhaps. But you didn’t think too much of his prospects as a dancer in our first meeting,” said Hannah. “What made you change your mind?”\n“The Registrar has assigned the case to Ehood Morag!”\n“What a rotten piece of luck,” said Hannah. “So, we start with a handicap!”\n“A two barrelled handicap,” muttered Keren, adding pointedly: “and I gather that you, Eli, aren’t – in a manner of speaking – one of Morag’s favourites!”\n“True,” I admitted.\n“I’m told he snaps at you?”\n“He does sometimes!”\n“Well, Eli” said Keren, his eyes fixed on a point over my shoulder, “a good general knows how to profit from a tactical disadvantage.”\n“I understand,” I affirmed, taking note of Hannah’s sympathetic glance.\n“Then see what you can come up with when he hears this application. You are to handle it. It’s time you leave your mark!”\n“Oh, very well, then,” I said with resignation.\nKeren smiled malevolently: “Good; but now Hannah and I must turn to another matter. You’ll excuse us!”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/the-luck-of-valentino/part-3/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHannah  spent  two weeks in the dental laboratory  of  an  old acquaintance.

Peppi’s Second Career Following this encounter, Peppi started to go from strength to strength. His friendship with Dad remained intact, with each rejoicing at the other’s success. Their paths, though, did not cross again.\nFor Dad, the turning point was Russia’s withdrawal from Vienna in 1951. He and Peppi saw in it Theophil’s hand. Modern historians have come up with a more mundane explanation: Russia’s bridgehead in Vienna was of no military, political or tactical advantage. Austria’s unilateral declaration of neutrality – the price exacted by the Russians for their withdrawal – constituted a safer barrier against Western aggression than the sparse Red Army troops stationed in the old Habsburg capital.\nDad returned to Vienna by the end of the year. Within two years he was once again Vienna’s leading broker in the import of fruit and vegetables from Italy and Spain. He did not amass a fortune but enjoyed a comfortable and relaxed life. I, too, benefited from his success. He saw me through my postgraduate studies at Oxford. I visited his at least twice a year during this period. Apart from the pleasure of seeing him, I managed to rekindle my mid European heritage.\nPeppi did not return to Vienna. A few days after the incident on the platform, he apprenticed himself to one of Munich’s leading antiques dealers. Initially, Herr Schultz was reluctant to take on a middle-aged trainee. To allay his fears, Peppi launched into an analysis-cum-classification of the main artefacts displayed in the show window and cabinets. Duly impressed, Herr Schultz offered Peppi a six month attachment.\nPeppi passed with flying colours. When his probation was over, Herr Schultz offered him a regular post. The wages were meagre but Peppi soon earned a fair living out of his sales commissions. By the end of his second year in the trade, he had acquired expertise in tapestries and in old masters’ prints. He also established excellent relations with the clients, who regarded him a trustworthy and knowledgeable dealer.\nHerr Schultz, alas, was unable to reap the benefits of the business’s success. It came too late. Having lost his wife in an air raid and his only son on the African front, he had no heir. This disappointing fact of life, and his natural fair mindedness, encouraged Herr Schultz to constitute the indefatigable and resourceful Peppi a full and equal partner. His only misgiving concerned their surnames: a high-class antiques business ought not to be carried on under two common names. Obligingly, Peppi changed his surname to Stölzenfeld.\nThey continued to work together for another five years, and the business went from strength to strength. Then Herr Schultz came up with an irresistible proposition. Admitting that he felt the need to retire, he suggested that Peppi pay him an annuity in consideration of his share in the business. Despite Helga’s doubts, Peppi accepted. Some fourteen months after his retirement, Herr Schultz passed away.\nOn his return to Munich after the funeral, Peppi settled into his leather chair, the special bottle in his hand, and took stock of his situation. He was some sixty-two years of age, in perfect health and happily married.\nHis two daughters were a source of joy. Lucy, it was true, remained a tomboy. Her blunt mannerisms and sharp tongue scared many a potential suitor away. But she was exceptionally bright, had consistently won all the school prizes on offer in the humanities and – to Peppi’s delight – had developed an interest in antiques. Her future, Peppi sensed, would be secure even if she remained unattached.\nHis second daughter, Anna, had the makings of a belle. She was mirror conscious, donned smart dresses and spent hours on her hairstyle. True, her marks in school were nothing to boast about and her piano teacher was taciturn when reporting on her progress and application. Peppi and Helga were unable to spur her into work. Helga grieved; Peppi remained unperturbed. “She may never develop into a business or career woman,” he mused complacently; “but she’ll sure know how to handle her husband and keep him happy and on the leash!”\nLooking affectionately at his special bottle, Peppi concluded that all was well on the domestic front. Financially, too, his position was secure and, most importantly, he enjoyed his latest occupation and craved nothing else. Admittedly, he was well past the passions and great expectations of youth as well as the financial aspirations of mid-life. His main ambition was to use his remaining working years so as to expand Schultz and Stölzenfeld and turn it into the best antiques shop in Germany.\nIt took Peppi a few more years to achieve his target. In March 1966, Peppi’s standing was lauded in Der Spiegel. A reportage in its Art pages, which ranked the best known art and antiques shops in Western Germany, named Schultz and Stölzenfeld the leading experts in medieval tapestries and old master prints. Lucy and Anna were jubilant. Helga embraced Peppi in front of her daughters and, failing to suppress tears of joy, exclaimed: “At long last you’ve made it, Liebling!”\nPeppi’s success did not go to his head. But it encouraged him to look for further openings for his business. Sensing that Munich was too small for him, he travelled first to Frankfurt and then to Hamburg with a view to opening branches. When he realised that both towns had their own well established dealers, he made a trip to Paris but realised that he would be unable to carve a niche for himself in the local thriving antiques market.\nHe was about to give up when Lucy, who had just graduated from Munich’s University with a summa cum laude in Classics and Medieval Philosophy, suggested that they attend an antiques fair in London. Helga was supportive, and so Peppi agreed. His real object, though, was to visit the Tower of London and to spend a few days in museums.\n2. The London Venture To his own surprise, Peppi fell in love with Old London Town. He spent an entire week in the British Museum and the V\u0026amp;A and admired the Strand and the boats sailing up and down the Thames. He enjoyed the West End and its sparkling theatres and felt awed by Westminster Abbey and St Paul’s. Indeed, he got so carried away that he investigated the possibility of transplanting Big Ben from its time honoured abode to Munich’s Town Hall. Fortunately, young Lucy persuaded her agitated father that his idea was improper.\nPeppi and Lucy spent an extra week in London. One morning, as they were walking back to the hotel from the Portobello Market, they stumbled into Kensington Church Street. A good look at the wares and artefacts displayed in the show windows of the antiques shops convinced Peppi that he had found a suitable location for a branch. After some deliberation, Peppi rented a spacious shop that had just been vacated. His only concern was how to staff his new business. Unexpectedly, Lucy came up with a simple solution.\n“If you want, I’ll run it for you, Papa. I’ve been helping you out in Munich for three years!”\n“You are a good judge of antiques and you do know how to run the business, but do you really want to live all on your own in London? The British are alright but just a little bit funny, aren’t they?”\n“You fear, Papa, that I won’t find a suitable husband in London!” giggled Lucy.\n“That too,” admitted Peppi.\n“But, Dad, I don’t intend to get married. I can manage perfectly well without a fool of a husband tied to my apron strings.”\n“Oh well,” said Peppi resignedly. “If that’s the way you feel, you might as well start this new business here – if Helga agrees.”\n“She will,” said Lucy.\nThey spent the next few days searching for suitable accommodation. Peppi’s idea was to purchase a flat in St John’s Wood. Lucy, however, recalled the covetous glances Peppi had cast at a house in Hampstead. Lucy, too, liked it. All the same, Peppi was unable to disguise his unease.\n“What worries you, Papa? Hampstead is a safe area: just as safe as St John’s Wood.”\n“I know. But I can’t bear the thought of your living all alone in such a big house. Suppose somebody loses his way on the heath and tries to get in?”\n“Aren’t you just a bit fanciful, Papa?”\nShe had made her point. On her solemn promise to install a burglar alarm and keep the doors locked and bolted at night, Peppi agreed to buy the lovely house.\nAll that remained to be done was to find a suitable name for their new business. ‘Schultz and Stölzenfeld’ appeared inappropriate for a London based business. ‘Stölzenfeld and Daughter’ sounded even worse. Eventually, Peppi suggested ‘Theophil’s Antiques’.\n“But we don’t know any Théophile. Why do you want to use a bogus name?”\n“Why ever not?” countered Peppi, trying to sound authoritative.\n“Why ever not,” mimicked Lucy. “Papa, that’s the funniest thing you have said in months! Still, I suppose Théophile sounds sort of cute.”\n“It’s not ‘Théophile’ but ‘Theophil’ – without an ‘e’.”\n“Lover of theorising? Come to think of it, I like it. Alright then, Papa.”\nHelga was bemused when told of the exploits of her husband and elder daughter. “Well, well, so now we have two antiques dealers in our family. Whatever next!”\n“Next is: Papa must become Herr von Stölzenfeld!” answered Anna.\n“And why is that, my dear lady?” asked Peppi, looking affectionately at his younger daughter, a girl of fourteen, who was fast maturing into an attractive and self-assured woman.\n“Because then I’ll be Fräulein von Stölzenfeld and everybody will treat me with great respect!”\n“Now, now, Anna. Snobbery is a sin; and it’s also stupid,” censured Helga, but Anna persisted.\n“But it’s cute to be Fräulein von Stölzenfeld!”\n“And the British are great snobs,” intercepted Peppi.\n“So because they are snobs you want to spend money for the privilege of adding a ‘von’ to your perfectly respectable name?” asked Helga, bewildered.\n“Our teachers told us that Balzac just added ‘de’ in front of his surname. So why can’t Papa insert the ‘von’?” protested Anna.\nThe matter ended there. But Peppi went to bed in contemplative mood. After lengthy meanderings, he concluded that an antic, resorted to by a French penny-a-liner like Balzac, was equally fair for Peppi Stölzl. Shortly before her departure to London, Lucy discovered that the sign above their Munich shop had undergone a subtle change. The new insignia read: ‘Schultz \u0026amp; Stölzenfeld; Proprietor: Joseph-Dieter von Stölzenfeld’. Down to earth Lucy had a good laugh. Helga, in contrast, snorted upon hearing of Peppi’s most recent ascent. Anna took a very different view. Embracing her father ecstatically, she exclaimed: “And now you must buy a big signet ring, Papa.”\nUnder Lucy’s management, Theophil’s Antiques made steady progress. True, Lucy lacked Peppi’s psychological agility, monumental drive and natural knack for clinching a bargain. Clients, though, responded favourably to her sincere efforts to assist them and sensed that she was a fair and scrupulous businesswoman. Within two years, she had acquired a steady and loyal clientele. Her other achievement was the branching out into illuminated medieval books. In no time, she developed a first class expertise.\nPeppi shuttled regularly between the two shops. After a while, he felt increasingly attached to London. Initially, he spent his evenings in the West End and occasionally went to a concert. Then, at Lucy’s instigation, he joined the famed Artiquar Club. Thereafter, father and daughter spent many a pleasant evening in the Club’s discreet Reading Room. Lucy, who had become a regular contributor to the Medieval Books pages of the Artiquar Quarterly, browsed professional literature whilst Peppi looked up old catalogues of London’s leading sales rooms. Shortly after Peppi became a member, he persuaded Lucy to let her name run for the illustrious post of Curator. Her doting father’s chest bulged with pride when his daughter was elected unanimously.\n3. Becoming Freiherr von Stölzenfel Problems surfaced when Peppi contributed an article on medieval tapestries from Anjou. A few weeks after its publication, he received a hand-written letter, carrying the postmark of Leipzig and signed ‘Karl Adelbert Freiherr von Stölzenfeld’. It ended with the words: “Will you kindly let me know forthwith by what right you sign your writings with a title conferred on my ancestor by Frederick the Great?”\nA lesser man might have panicked. Peppi took the onslaught in his stride. To calm his nerves, he drew a few swigs from his cherished bottle. Under its strange influence he commissioned a private investigator’s report. The information he received confirmed the Freiherr’s exclusive right to his esteemed title but also established that the aging squire was penniless. When the nobleman’s fury had abated, Peppi began negotiations. In the end, the Freiherr agreed to receive a handsome stipend, and adopted Peppi into his family. In this way Peppi acquired the lawful right to use the ‘von’ and, as the old nobleman had no heir, was assured of succeeding to the time-honoured ‘Freiherr’ designation.\nLucy displayed her amusement without reserve. To her mind, it was all too silly for words. Helga, whose religiosity was reaching an advanced state, disagreed. Unable to hide her chagrin, she said the money could have been spent more sensibly on a donation to charity. She was appeased only when Peppi pointed out that the aging Freiherr was actually one of the deserving poor. Young Anna thought it best to keep her counsel. Late in the evening, though, when her mother had gone to church to listen to a preacher from Potsdam, she told Peppi affectionately: “So one day you will be a real Freiherr, Papa!” Peppi Stölzl beamed.\nTime passed, and things continued to flow smoothly. For a while not a ripple disturbed the calm waters of their existence. Although Peppi was in his late sixties, he retained his old zest for life. Often, when Helga attended a religious function, he took Anna out to dinner.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-devil-in-munich/chapter-3/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"1-peppis-second-career\"\u003e1. Peppi’s Second Career\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing this encounter, Peppi started to go from strength to strength.

Their paths, though,  did not cross again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Dad, the turning point was Russia’s withdrawal from Vienna in 1951. He and Peppi saw in it Theophil’s hand. Modern historians have come up with a more mundane explanation: Russia’s bridgehead in Vienna was of no military, political or tactical advantage. Austria’s unilateral declaration of neutrality – the price exacted by the Russians for their withdrawal – constituted a safer barrier against Western aggression than the sparse Red Army troops stationed in the old Habsburg capital.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Chapter 3: An Antiques Dealer in Munich"},{"content":"1. We Attend Trials Our teacher granted us leave to attend court hearings during three mornings dominated by classes on science. As Pilkin’s home was not far from the District Court building, I went to pick him up early in the morning. His mother’s unadorned poorly furnished flat on the top floor of a run down apartment block made me gape. Obviously, his late father had not left them well off. Embarrassed, I remembered Shosh had told me that, when opportunity presented itself, Pilkin and his young brother, David, carried out odd jobs, such as deliveries, doubling up for newspaper vendors and occasional home repairs. To my relief, Pilkin appeared unaware of my consternation. He watched with satisfaction as I sipped the cup of hot and aromatic lemon tea his mother brought me and then showed me, with relish, his small but neatly organised and catalogued collection of coins.\nAt Pilkin’s suggestion, we spent our first morning watching a murder trial and an armed robbery. Both cases were dull. In neither did the accused have an alibi or coherent defence. We then watched a number of run of the mill road and industrial accident cases. Pilkin was taken aback by the rigour and speed of the cross-examinations administered to the main witnesses and by the brevity of the lawyers’ arguments. And he was disappointed by the absence of drama.\nTo stem the flow of his critical comments, I took him to watch the final stage of one of the spectacular trials of the day. It involved an action for compensation for personal injuries suffered by a civil servant. He had bought a bottle of locally distilled brandy supposedly fortified with pure alcohol. He had consumed the same fiery drink on previous occasions without ill effects. But this time the brandy was laced with methylated spirits. The source was a hardware and paints shop. Its owner had sold the methylated spirits to a painting contractor, who, together with another middleman, had eliminated the dye and smelly substance from the liquid. The rogues then sold it to the unsuspecting liqueur outlet at the prevailing black market price for illegally imported pure alcohol. The civil servant was one of the unfortunate purchasers of the final product.\nPilkin and I watched with fascination the pungent cross-examination of the owner of the hardware and paints shop. Doggedly, Jacob Keren – a lawyer whose sparkling performance I had admired on previous occasions – forced the witness to concede he had failed to exercise proper care and prudence when he sold large quantities of the ‘poison’ to a contractor who could not possibly need more than ‘one single bottle at a time’ for his business as painter and renovator. Eventually, the hapless witness even admitted that he knew the ‘filthy stuff’ could be ‘doctored’.\n“Yes - I understand,” said Keren, who despite his short and lean figure loomed larger than life. “It was no villainy – just a lapse. Well, let me tell you again what were the consequence: the plaintiff is now nearly blind, partially deaf, has a stammer and will walk unsteadily for the rest of his life. Not a life to be envied!”\n“This is not a proper question,” intervened the judge.\n“I’ll withdraw it then, Your Honour. No further questions.” Keren nodded and sat down.\n2. Meeting Jacob Keren “What an act,” said Pilkin when we made ourselves comfortable at a nearby oriental restaurant, patronised by the legal fraternity of Tel Aviv.\n“I agree. But, you know, from what I have seen up to now, it’s clear the screenplay has to follow some pretty tight rules,” I observed. “Even a showman like Keren must reckon with them when he improvises.”\n“Can the other party’s lawyer step in?”\n“Only if the cross-examiner steps out of line, for instance, if he misleads the witness or uses unfair tactics to bully or confuse him. Still, when the cross-examination is over, the other party’s lawyer can try to repair any damage.”\n“With the few questions he asks when the cross-examination is finished?”\n“Yes. They call it the ‘re-examination’. But a skilful cross-examiner like Keren guards his rear. He makes sure that what he gets out of a witness will stick: just the way he did today.”\n“I see,” nodded Pilkin. “And is this how you want us to conduct our trial of Josephus? By examining, cross-examining and re-examining witnesses?”\n“Well, yes: it’s more fun than just arguing!”\n“I want to think this over,” said Pilkin. “Still, it appears alright. It’ll put a bit of life into the case. But look here, Bushi \u0026hellip;”.\n“Didn’t I see you two in Court today?” Jacob Keren’s protruding eyes were peering at us with unconcealed interest.\n“We were there, Mr Keren,” I confirmed, rising to my feet. Pilkin, in contrast, remained seated.\n“And what drove you to our little show?” Keren wanted to know. “And haven’t I seen you before, Mr. \u0026hellip;”.\n“Eli Berger, Mr Keren,” I introduced myself, “and this is my friend, Chayim Rosenberg. And, yes, I come to watch court cases whenever I can.”\n“You like the excitement?”\n“I do indeed!”\n“And you, Mr. Rosenberg?”\n“Please, call me Chayim,” Pilkin replied. “I came because we are going to have a trial at school. So Eli insisted I see what happens in the real courts.”\n“What sort of trial?” Keren was interested.\n“A historical trial of Josephus Flavius. Eli is the defence lawyer; I am the prosecutor.”\n“But how do you propose to go about it?” Keren asked with a smile. “The accused can’t give any evidence!”\n“We’ll be using his writings, Mr. Keren,” I explained. “Do you know them?”\n“I do, although it’s been some time since I’ve read them. But how do you propose to defend him? Who will be your witnesses?”\n“I don’t intend to call any. I’ll make my points by cross-examining my ‘Learned Colleagues’ witnesses. They’ll testify about Josephus’ writings.”\n“So they’ll try to pierce holes and you’ll try to plug them?”\n“My object is to establish his innocence!”\n“But you needn’t prove him innocent. The prosecution must prove his guilt!”\n“I know. But my poor client,” I said, startled as both Keren and Pilkin grinned when I brandished the courtroom phrase, “has been maligned for generations. To clear his name, I must show the accusations are unfounded!”\n“And you’ll risk a ‘guilty’ verdict if your attempt fails?”\n“He’ll be no worse off than before,” I observed.\n“I see,” nodded Keren. “And what will be your strategy? But perhaps you don’t want to reveal your hand at this stage?”\nInitially, I sought to dodge his question. The plan I had formed involved surprises. Communicating an inkling of it to Pilkin might take the wind out of my sails. At the same time, I had no wish to appear evasive. After a short pause, I replied: “I intend to show that passages in Josephus’ books, traditionally used to prove his guilt, proclaim his innocence. I may fail – but not for want of trying!”\n“A daring plan; and quite imaginative,” Keren smiled supportively. “And shall we see you again in Court when your trial is over? You have been dropping in for months.”\n“And I’ll continue to do so. You see, I’ve decided to study law. I come over in order to learn and gain experience.”\n“But don’t you find many of the cases boring – plain routine?”\n“I do. But ever so often there is a fascinating case, like your trial of today!”\n“But much of what we do, especially office work, is mundane. Still, you’ll know whether or not you have a penchant for it after your second year in law school. If you remain interested, come and see me!”\n“Thanks,” I said, moved. “I’m sure to take you up on this!”\n“And you, Mr. Rosenberg – you also plan to join our ranks?”\n“No,” Pilkin was laconic. “I intend to become an actor!”\n“A fine career,” approbated Keren. “I was toying with the idea before I picked on the law!”\n“What made you prefer law?” Pilkin was no respecter of rank.\n“Prudence; opting for security rather than poetry: for the sixpence – not for the moon!”\nFor a moment Jacob Keren remained lost in his thoughts. He then brought our conversation to an end, observing abruptly: “Interesting subjects, aren’t they? But I must really join my Learned Colleague. I think we can now settle this wretched case sensibly. So, Chayim, let me wish you much success in your career on the stage. I’ll look forward to your performances. And you, Eli, remember to see me once you have decided for sure you want a career in the Law.”\nShaking hands with both of us, he made his way rapidly to the stairway leading to the VIP section on the upper floor. Our eyes had followed him with respect. Even forty years after this chance meeting, as I was twisting restlessly on the comfortable bed in Pension Kegel, I recalled vividly the impact that the aging Jacob Keren had left on young Pilkin and myself. True, on my friend the encounter had but a transient effect. In contrast, it exercised a profound influence over my subsequent, lengthy, career as a lawyer.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/reunion-in-zermatt/chapter-3/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"1-we-attend-trials\"\u003e1.

An Odd Jobs Boy Father passed away a few weeks before my eighth birthday. My brother David was just three years old. I stood by the still uncovered grave, beside Mother who was crying. My eyes, in contrast, remained dry. What I recall most vividly is my impatience to go home because I thought that David, who had remained in the care of a neighbour, might need me.\nAs yet, the meaning of our loss had not dawned on me. I knew, of course, that I was not going to see my smiling, active and supportive Father ever again. He would no longer pat my shoulder and grin proudly when I showed him my school grades. He had gone – so Mother said – to a better world where he would know no sorrow or pain. The effect that his death was bound to have on us – the constraints of a family without a breadwinner and the ensuing financial problems – were beyond my grasp.\nI got a clearer appreciation of what was in store in the ensuing weeks. Gone were the rich soups and splendid dishes Mother loved to prepare for us. We now had to make do with watery broth and endless arrays of tripe and other cheap cuts. Worse still, on Shabbat Eve there was no stuffed chicken; and the smoked meat in our Cholent was scarce. To ensure David had no cause to complain, I heaped on his plate the scraps I managed to find.\nInitially Mother told us we were not going to remain poverty stricken for long. A fine company, the Rotem Assurance Company, would pay us some money. Dad had insured his life with them and so now they had to pay up. Her face, I noticed, assumed an expectant expression when a bespectacled middle-aged man, in a worn out suit and well trodden shoes, knocked on our door and, eventually, took some forms out of his briefcase. After a few of his visits, though, Mother’s face started to look grim. Then one day she burst into tears after she had slit open an envelope containing a typed letter.\n“What’s the matter, Mom?” I asked.\n“The insurance company refuses to pay up; they say Dad committed a ‘breach of the terms of the policy’ and so they are cancelling it ‘with retrospective effect to the assured’s date of death’. I’m not sure what this means; but they go on to say that ‘out of concern’ they are prepared to pay us ‘10% above the surrender value of the policy’.”\n“What does this mean, Mom?”\n“I’m not so sure; but I think they’ll pay us very little.”\n“Why don’t you talk to Uncle Jacob?”\n“Last year he and Dad had quarreled. I don’t trust him. No, Chayim; I’ll ring that Mr. Levi from Rotem. I think he is nice; and I’m sure he would not want to cheat a poor widow.”\n“You know best, Mom.”\nThe middle-aged man was dressed as shabbily as before. After her conversation with him Mother looked worn out and bewildered. Still, the outcome was not altogether negative. Rotem paid us 25% above the surrender value of the policy, which meant we got about one quarter of the sum insured. It was not much; but it helped Mother to see us through.\nBeing a determined woman, Mother made every effort to improve our lot. Before long, we moved to a cheap flat on the top floor of a dilapidated building in the poor, south end, of Allenby Street. To augment our income, Mother – who had had little education – took up household jobs, mainly the washing of clothes and window cleaning. Later on, she ran a luncheon service. The patrons were civil servants, businessmen and some professionals. Normally, she earned enough to keep us fed and clothed; but periods of shortages – even acute ones – took place from time to time.\nMy own plunge into the employment market took place shortly after my ninth birthday. Worn out by toil and long working hours, Mother had to be confined to bed with a bout of pneumonia. After four weeks our small account was overdrawn beyond the ceiling approved by the bank. Fortunately Uncle Jacob rose to the occasion. With his help, we managed to keep going until Mother recovered. But, even so, we were impecunious or – in plain language – broke.\nI was raking my young brain, hoping to find a way to ease Mother’s burden. Having just read my first detective story, I even contemplated a hold up, armed with a toy gun Uncle Jacob had given me on Purim – the Jewish carnival – and my face shielded with a Balaclava.\nFortunately, I was spared the need to resort to such desperate action. Help came from our next door neighbour, a Mrs. Kornmehl, who was famed for her mean-looking, though utterly harmless, bulldog. One afternoon, when I was loafing about in front of the building, she asked me to look after her dog while she climbed back to her flat to get a bag she had left behind. She must have galloped upstairs because she returned flushed and breathing hard. Out of concern, I escorted her to the grocer and butcher and helped her to carry her heavy shopping bags upstairs. She thanked me profusely and, to my surprise, rewarded me with a 5 Piasters coin.\nMother eyed me with suspicion when I handed her the money. For a while, both of us remained silent.\n“Chayim,” she asked at long last, “did you beg for it?”\n“No, Mom; I did not. Mrs. Kornmehl gave it to me because I looked after her dog and helped her to carry bags. I did not expect it.”\n“Then it’s a reward for an honest job; a job well done; that’s fine. Good boy. But don’t you ever beg for money, Chayim. We have our pride: we must not lose it.”\n“I know, Mom.”\n“Good.”\nIn the ensuing months I did a variety of jobs. I continued to carry bags and parcels, occasionally went shopping for housewives, equipped with their lists and money, and some of the shopkeepers, especially the florist, engaged me as a delivery boy. Later on, I carried ice blocks from the delivery carts to the kitchens of houses in our neighbourhood and, during the summer vacation, sold ice cream cones on the beach. Another seasonal trade was the sale of sweet corn, cooked in a huge pot heated on a kerosene stove. Initially, I was engaged as a ‘support staff’; but when my boss was arrested after a brawl with a customer, I purchased his equipment for a song and took his business over. It turned out to be a lucrative trade: I made a handsome profit.\nDuring my last years in primary school I acquired considerable skills as electrician and plumber. On one occasion, I even replaced faulty water pipes in an old apartment. David, who was growing up fast, became a useful assistant. To reward him, I constituted him a full partner in my first regular enterprise, which was the delivery of a daily newspaper in our neighbourhood. Although the franchise had to be acquired in Mother’s name, its running was left in its entirety in the hands of the two of us. Before long, our profits rose above Mother’s meagre earnings. I recall with pride how Uncle Jacob said to her “Chayim and David are good boys; they’ll go far, I tell you.”\nOther boys in our neighbourhood were also working. In our run-down part of town – so different from fashionable Frischman Street where we used to live during Father’s days – times were hard. Tradesmen and shopkeepers were keen to divert wages payable to apprentices or employees to members of the family. Child labour was common.\nThe boy with who I shared a bench in school, for instance, assisted in his father’s greengrocery. Every now and then, the boy had to miss a class in order to look after the business while his father went to the wholesale market. Another boy was, for all practical purposes, apprenticed to his father, who was a carpenter. He developed considerable skill in the use of the saw and the chisel. Still, on one occasion he appeared in class with his left hand bandaged. The sons of an electrician and of a decorator were both toiling in their respective family’s business. So was the plumber’s son, whom David and I called upon when occasionally a job was beyond us.\nMy best friend in those days was Amram, who enjoyed working in his uncle’s dental laboratory. A born draftsman, he had hands of gold and a sharp eye. Every now and then he amused us with his caricatures of our school’s teachers and of classmates. His ambition, though, was to become a lapidary. He felt convinced that his experience in his uncle’s enterprise constituted a good springboard for his career.\n“But Amram,” I asked him once, “don’t you want to be a caricaturist? What’s so great about a jeweller’s life?”\n“You can use your imagination without constraints. A caricaturist depends on his subjects.”\n“But your jewellery must be popular; if your pieces aren’t, people won’t buy them.”\n“That’s where your art and good taste come in!”\n“I see,” I conceded, “and I’m sure you’ll make lovely pieces for your wife.”\n“But I’m not going to get married, Chayim.”\n“Why?”\n“Because I see how Dad and Mom fight. It’s more peaceful to live on your own.”\n“I don’t remember my late Father ever fighting with Mom,” I protested.\n“Perhaps you don’t remember; but my mind is made up. I’ll have the best shop in Tel Aviv. And I’ll have many friends and a good life, Chayim.”\n“Well, I’ll come to your shop with my wife to buy nice pieces.”\n“If she’s good looking, I’ll give you a 10% discount.”\nOdd to say, Amram kept his promise. Years later, I went to his shop, by then renowned in the trade, to buy a bracelet for Yentl. Initially Amram did not recognise me but, when he did, he bestowed on her a searching look and, winking slyly, granted me the promised reduction. His manifesto on life and marriage, though, must have undergone a change. As Yentl and I were about to take our leave, an attractive girl burst in and apologised profusely for keeping Grandpa waiting. Amram conferred on her an indulgent and affectionate smile.\nTurning back to my schooldays, it is clear that quite a number of my classmates knew the taste of hard work. But they toiled like regular employees. I alone was an odd jobs boy and the owner of an enterprise of my own. In effect, I was my own boss. I was also the only family-head amongst them.\nHaving become an entrepreneur at so young an age had a profound effect on my life. I learned – perhaps prematurely – the importance of efficient planning. Waste of time involved loss of money or, rather, the missing of an opportunity to make some. Such frivolity was unforgivable. So were unreliability, unpunctuality and poor workmanship. Life had to be taken seriously as, indeed, had any commitment.\nMy early exposure to the real world also influenced my general outlook and orientation. The need of assessing the people I was dealing with in my odd jobs made me observant and gave me insight into human nature. For instance, I soon realised that the people who smiled at me warmly when they asked me to do a job were usually not as generous with their tips as those who appeared less friendly or outgoing.\nThe little stupidities of life, too, became known to me. One instance was a housewife’s wish to hide certain things – often innocent in themselves – from her husband. I remember how Mrs. Kornmehl and I once racked our brains to find a plausible explanation for the disappearance of her husband’s beloved coffee mug. She was willing to tell him any lie as long as her secret – that she had broken it in the sink – remained unveiled. In the event, we blamed the poor bulldog, who was supposed to have smashed it when he jumped on the table. Another absurdity I became acquainted with was the in-family wrangling about money often carried on in an uninhibited manner in front of a stranger like an odd jobs boy.\nIn general, my hard and hyperactive life prepared me for my odyssey. But it also took its toll. More often than not, I was fatigued when I arrived at school. Starting my day with the delivery of the morning newspapers I was also frequently late. Fortunately, punctuality was not strictly observed in our school. Indeed, some boys regarded our old fashioned institution a joke and flaunted discipline at will. They, too, arrived late from time-to-time and usually got off lightly. But when my own dereliction persisted, I was summoned by our Principal.\n“Chayim Rosenberg,” he came straight to the point, “this week you were late three times and last week four. Why can’t you get up in time? You are not a loafer. Your grades are fine and you do your home work regularly. So what’s your excuse for being late?”\n“I have to finish delivering newspapers before I go to school,” I told him unflinchingly.\n“You what?”\n“I deliver newspapers in the morning, Sir; to make money; if I don’t get them on time, I’m late.”\n“I know your family is not rich. But… Oh, I see,” he added after flipping through my file; “your father passed away a few years ago. Still, you are too young to have such a job.”\n“We need the money, Sir; Mom doesn’t make enough.”\n“Perhaps I better have a word with her.”\nI am not sure what transpired in their conversation. But it got me off the hook. After it, teachers closed their eye when I slipped in, often panting, some ten or fifteen minutes after the school bell had chimed. My conscientious preparation for classes, my active participation and my impressive grades established that my lapses were due to the force of circumstances.\nAll in all, my precocious existence was a source of pride. Yet it had some undesirable side effects. As was to be expected, I had little time for play. I used to envy other boys when, at the end of an exhausting day, I watched them playing soccer or ‘catch the thief’. Even those who worked in their family’s business were allowed enough time to enjoy themselves. I alone carried the responsibilities of an adult on my shoulders.\nTo overcome my chagrin, I used to tell myself that mine was a more responsible and ‘manly’ existence than theirs. Generally, this was an adequate placebo. A boy, though, is a boy. In reality, I should have welcomed the opportunity to taste the carefree way of life enjoyed by other boys.\nHad it not been for David, I might have turned into a morose, perhaps even insufferable, little man. Fortunately, David doted on me. His affection and patent regard, his attempts to copy me and to emulate my mannerism, had a positive effect on my disposition. So did his persistent efforts to keep me happy and contented. Even when I saw through his flattery, I chose to close my eyes.\nDavid was gregarious and many of his young friends kept calling on us. If I was free, I joined their amusements and, from time to time, guided them through their homework. Generally, I enjoyed helping others: an inclination that stood me in good stead throughout life. It was, actually, of major importance in my school days. Other boys tended to turn to me when they were unable to cope on their own and, when I could, I stepped in. I was, for instance, proud when they copied my exercises and homework assignments or cribbed my answers in school tests.\nSo despite the hardship our family was facing and my deprivations, I developed a positive approach to life. I was popular both in school and in the neighbourhood. I was also a confident and self assured boy. In this regard, my size and vigour were contributing factors. Few boys dared to challenge me.\nAll in all, I have predominantly pleasant memories of my primary school days. Many of them are associated with Mrs. Kornmehl. Having no children of her own, she developed a motherly interest in David and me. From time to time she went with us to a nearby swimming pool or to the beach and, on occasions, took us for an ice cream or a pita-falafel. Once she took us to a performance of the municipal fire brigade. I was fascinated by the antics – the sham rescues – and by the courage displayed by the members of the squad. Only one fireman lacked the courage to jump from the top of the tower onto the tarpaulin, gaining the hisses of the audience. A few months later, Mrs. Kornmehl took us to an East European circus, which spent a week in Tel Aviv. The performance of the animal trainer, who paraded his tigers, remains fresh in my mind. I also admired the beautiful girls, whose acrobatic feats appeared miraculous to my young eyes.\nThe most exciting treat Mrs. Kornmehl gave us was a reward for our initiative when a pipe burst in her bathroom. Her regular plumber having come down with a bout of bronchitis, David and I carried out a provisional repair. We also cleaned up the mess left by the gushing water. As we refused to accept payment, she showed her appreciation by taking us to a matinee in O’hel, at that time one of the two major local theatres.\nLike all Israeli boys, David and I had been to the cinema. The theatre, in contrast, was a new experience. I was captivated by the hilarious misdeeds of The Good Soldier Schweik, especially by a prank played by him and his bosom pal, Sapper Vodichka, on a hapless Hungarian tradesman married to a German lady.\nAfter the show, Mrs. Kornmehl led us behind the stage. As ‘Schweik’ was encircled by his admirers, she presented us to the actor who had played Sapper.\n“But you don’t look so funny now,” I told him in the course of our conversation.\n“I should hope not. I’m off stage now, Chayim.”\n“But aren’t you still the same person?”\n“Well, what do you think?” he asked in reply.\n“I suppose now you are Ori Joseph; not Sapper Vodichka. But if you are a different person now, how can you play Sapper?”\n“But don’t you, Chayim, sometimes play a role – like when you try to scare off another boy or when you want your teacher to think you are a good and obedient boy?”\n“I suppose I do; but I’m still Chayim.”\n“But not exactly the same Chayim. Now you are a curious Chayim, aren’t you?”\n“I suppose so; but Sapper and you are different persons altogether.”\n“But suppose you, Chayim, played Sapper. Would your Sapper be the same as mine?”\n“Perhaps not,” I admitted. “I can’t make the same grimaces or speak like you.”\n“So Sapper Vodichka isn’t always the same chap; depends who plays him. Also you Chayim are not always the same Chayim; depends on your mood.”\n“So where is the difference between a role like Sapper and me?”\n“When you play a role in a drama – like Sapper – you try to be Sapper; you have to follow the lines and you must remain true to the script. When you are Chayim, you play your own roles on the spur of the moment. You are both author and actor. You see?”\n“I think so,” I said lamely; “I’ll have to think this over.”\n“Do; but I’ll let you in on another secret. A great actor’s performance is realistic; the audience is convinced by his act. But he still remains himself. Think about this, young man.”\n“I sure will,” I promised; “but it sounds so difficult to be yourself and also someone else. So why do people want to be actors? Do they want to be famous?”\n“That, too, Chayim; every actor wants to be successful and so he wants to be celebrated. But there is another reason. A good actor craves to give people pleasure; and he is delighted when they respond. Their applause is music to his ears. Nowadays many actors have a dull desk job in town so as to make a living; but they come to life on stage. That’s why many of us are here.”\nI kept pondering on these words for weeks. The idea of an ovation appealed to me. So did the prospect of making people happy by acting a role. My dream of a life on the stage had its origin in that matinee show. It was, I believe, a product of both the excitement of the lively performance and of the impact left by the conversation.\nMrs. Kornmehl, who took David and me to the show, had, even if unintentionally, sewn the seed of my career. She also affected my views of culture and literature. Being the well-read daughter of a professional middle-class family of Hamburg, she had – like many Yekes – a robust contempt for the education meted out in our schools. In her opinion Biblical Studies were silly and the concentration on Jewish history ill-conceived. She also took exception to our being directed to the books of predominantly chauvinistic Jewish authors, many translated into Hebrew from Yiddish. She was keen to widen our horizons.\nKnowing David and I were monolingual, she kept bringing us Hebrew translations of good books. Occasionally, she even read us out short stories, translating them ex tempore from the German or French original in front of her into fluent even if accentuated Hebrew. Once – I believe it was to celebrate David’s eighth birthday – she went to the trouble of compressing for our benefit Chekhov’s The Steppe, which she had mastered by comparing its German translation with an English one. To this very day, I recall the impact left on us by Yegorushka’s trip across the Russian prairie and by the description of the thunderstorm he braved on the way.\nLater on, when Mrs. Kornmehl spotted my awakening interest in drama, she directed my attention to excellent Hebrew translations of Wilhelm Tell and of some Greek plays, such as Prometheus. Sometimes the three of us read out the different roles in a drama. Then, one bright day, she brought me Shalom Aleichem’s Tevyeh the Milkman.\nThe story, which is well known, describes the life of a Jew living in a small village in Czarist Russia. Usually, Tevyeh is able to cope with the setbacks he encounters. For instance, when his horse gets lame he pushes his milk-cart on his own. He also remains basically tolerant. Thus, he supports his oldest daughter’s decision to marry the man she loves although the matchmaker has other plans for her. Similarly, he backs his second daughter when she decides to accompany the man she loves to his exile in Siberia. However, he is unable to come to terms with his third daughter’s elopement with a Cossack. His entire Jewish tradition and background cannot cope with what appears to him a rejection of all his traditional values. A few weeks later Mrs. Kornmehl asked whom I should prefer to play: Schweik or Tevyeh.\n“Tevyeh,” I told her without hesitation.\n“But why? Isn’t Schweik smart and funny?”\n“He is; but all he does is play pranks; and he looks only after himself; and he bends with the wind.”\n“And Tevyeh?” she asked.\n“Tevyeh is also funny. But he has gumption; and he is doer. When he can, he stands up to the Russians. He is no coward! Schweik gives way or plays a trick to get out of a spot; but he’s got no guts.”\n“How about Tevyeh’s rejection of his daughter who runs away with the Cossack?”\n“To him this was just too much; I can understand him. She turned her back on everything holy to him; she hurt him; and he couldn’t take it.”\n“What would Schweik do in such a situation?”\n“Poke fun and not care; so I prefer Tevyeh. He’s a real man. Schweik is a yokel.”\n“Well, Chayim, perhaps one day you will play Tevyeh; you’ll be real good.” she said, bestowing on me an encouraging smile.\nThe conversations with Mrs. Kornmehl and our reading sessions remain fresh in my mind to this very day. I recall vividly the contrast between the dramatic tone of her booming voice and her plain appearance: her conservative thick glasses, her round face with its double chin, her lacklustre eyes and her sagging, shapeless, figure. Her fervour as a reader, though, made us forget her unadorned looks. She left a lasting impression on both David and me. So I regret to have to admit that I do not know what became of her. Shortly before I finished primary school, her husband was transferred to his company’s office in Nahariya. For a while we corresponded but, with the passage of time, our exchange of letters became sporadic and, eventually, ceased.\nNot all my pastimes were as dramatic or as culturally orientated as our intercourse with Mrs. Kornmehl. Some were mundane. Like most Israeli boys, David and I were football fans. Whenever possible, we went to watch a match, with David clamouring his support for Betar and I cheering Maccabi. In spring and autumn – when the weather was cool but dry – we hired a boat and rowed up the Yarkon.\nIn effect, despite the hardships occasioned by Father’s demise, I had a pleasant enough boyhood. The cause of his death, though, remained a mystery. Mother kept telling us conflicting stories. Once she volunteered that Father had died from a severe illness. On another occasion she said he had done something silly. When I asked why the insurance company had paid us such a pittance, she became flustered and told me to leave her alone. Uncle Jacob too remained uncommunicative on this subject. As he was ordinarily garrulous, his reticence was out of character. My curiosity was fed by some veiled exchanges on the subject between Mother and Mrs. Kornmehl and by their knowing glances and a hush-up attitude when I entered the room.\nDespite my efforts, I failed to get to the bottom of the matter during my school days and army service. But I was annoyed when Mother maintained her silence even when, for all practical purposes, I had grown into a young man. To get an answer, I turned to Eli Berger, who worked in a law firm and had just been called to the Israeli Bar. I knew he had had some experience with insurance law and so, suppressing my trepidation, I called on him.\nEli’s small office reeked of kerosene. Although it was a warm spring days – with the skies blue and unclouded – the heater was on. Feeling suffocated, I asked him to open the window.\n“Of course,” he agreed and opened the window just enough to let some fresh air in. “I’ve just recovered from a flu and bad asthma attacks. I’ve got to be careful.” Sliding back into his chair, he waited for me to continue. He had grasped that this was not a social call.\n“Stale air won’t help you, Bushi,” I persevered, addressing him by his nickname. “Fresh air is better than any medicine.”\n“May be,” he muttered and, accepting my lead into informalities, went on: “But, Pilkin, that’s not what you’ve on your mind.”\n“True. I’ve come to ask you to look into the circumstances of my Father’s death.”\n“What?” he let his surprise show.\n“I want to know Father’s cause of death and also why the insurance company paid a lousy amount. We got just a quarter of the ‘sum insured’. Mother refuses to talk about it; but I want to get to the bottom of it.”\n“But, Pilkin, it happened such a long time ago. Why does it still bother you? Are you thinking of recompense?”\n“No! I am not. But I’ve got to know, Bushi; I’ve got to know. Will you give it a try?”\n“Of course; but I’m not sure I can be of much use. There may be no records. Well, tell me what you know.”\nEli listened attentively to the fragile details I was able to supply. He looked gloomy until I mentioned the name of the insurance company. Rotem was a client of his firm. He could not accept instructions to act against it but the connection ought to assist him in the pursuit of a mere enquiry. He promised to contact me as soon as he had some news, probably within two or three weeks.\nEli Berger was a reliable and efficient individual. So I was perturbed when a whole month passed without news from him. When, on top of it, he was unavailable whenever I rang, I thought it was time to pay him a surprise visit.\n“So you are not too pleased to see me,” I complained, adding as he beckoned me to the client’s chair: “Don’t tell me you have no news for me.”\n“It’s not so easy to unearth old records, Pilkin,” he said; but his eyes avoided mine.\n“I find it hard to believe you’ve come up with nothing. You are too smart; and you would have rung to tell me. I know you, Bushi. So let’s hear what you’ve dug up.”\n“Are you sure you want to know? Won’t it be enough to know that, all in all, no injustice was done to your family; I can assure you of that.”\n“That’s not my main concern; I want to know what had actually happened. I’ve suspected for years that Dad had killed himself. But I want to know the background – all there is to it. Knowing the truth can’t be worse than being kept in the dark.”\n“Oh, very well,” he caved in.\nEli’s story threw light on Mother’s awkwardness, on Uncle Jacob’s dark hints and on Mrs. Kornmehl’s ill-disguised sympathy. Although some of the facts were known to me, Eli’s narration put the untidy facets of the puzzle in place. As was to be expected, his summary was clear and detached.\nMy Father, Moshe Rosenberg, had been employed for over ten years by a trading firm. A dependable and able staff member, he had risen rapidly through the ranks. The future appeared rosy. The position changed when, during the turmoil that reigned in Europe on the eve of WWII, his firm lost two of its major markets. Rejecting a salary cut, Dad took his severance pay and looked for another job. Initially, he found some openings albeit at salaries lower than his latest pay package. He declined and pressed on. Regrettably, the general employment situation continued to deteriorate. By the end of six months following his retrenchment, he was still unemployed.\nBy then his optimism had given way to gloom. When he received his annual premium notice, he came up with a desperate scheme. He called on Rotem’s office and asked for a sum well above the ordinary surrender value of his life policy. If the company declined to pay, he would – so he said – have no option but ‘to do himself in’. Rotem refused but its conscientious staff member made a file note of the interview.\nDuring the following three weeks, Dad had another two unsuccessful job interviews. A few hours after he received the second negative reply, he jumped down from the roof of a high building, leaving a note saying he could not face life and despair any longer. A ‘suicide in a moment of madness’ verdict was returned by the coroner.\nNormally, Rotem would have ignored the Draconian rights conferred on it by a suicide clause in the policy. The case, though, had a twist. In the course of a routine investigation entrusted to him, Mr. Levi stumbled on the file note concerning the unfortunate interview. Although he sought to understate its importance, Rotem’s claims office felt unable to overlook it. They assumed that Moshe Rosenberg had committed suicide in order to ensure that his heirs got the full sum insured. In their eyes, this was fraud. So they offered to pay the surrender value of the policy plus 10%. It was only when Levi interceded, that they raised their offer.\n“Why did Levi want to help us?” I asked Eli.\n“He was a decent chap: didn’t want to have your deprivation on his conscience. In a memorandum, which is still on file, he pointed out that the three weeks lapse between the interview and the time of death were significant. Your Dad may have killed himself as a result of some ‘fresh event’, like his latest failure to secure employment.”\n“What do you think about this?”\n“A tenacious lawyer might have got you something like 50% on this argument.”\n“Why didn’t Levi try for it?”\n“Feared to risk his livelihood. Even so, he did more than most investigators would do.”\n“Can you do anything now?” I asked Eli after a pause.\n“I am afraid not. Your Mother signed a Deed of Settlement and also – after 14 years – the action is time barred. You might get something out of them by making a stink; but I don’t think it’s worth the trouble.”\n“I agree; it’s just that I wanted to know,” I assured him. “So forget about it.”\n“What shall I do with the documents I unearthed?”\n“Shred them,” I told him.\nOrdinarily I am not an ‘if only’ or ‘what if’ person. Thinking on these lines is a waste of time. You live life ‘as is’; and that is chapter and verse. All the same, I have occasionally asked myself whether David and I would have had a better start if Father had withstood the pressure of events and carried on the sad life of a man without job satisfaction. In such a scenario, Father would have become a drifter, moving discontentedly from one unsuitable post to another. The pressure on us would have been unbearable and, of course, with him around I would not have risen prematurely to the status of the head of our family.\nAs things turned out, I developed into a precocious go-getter, an odd jobs boy capable of discharging the responsibilities of a grown up. Right from early childhood I grasped that life was a serious business. The only valid motto is: do your best.\nThis philosophy enabled me to go from strength to strength throughout my life. In particular, it stood me in good stead when, at the beginning of my last year in primary school, Dr. M. Cohen, a member of the Municipal Board of Education, paid our school an official visit and, at our Principal’s request, addressed our Form. The message he delivered to us concerned a model secondary school – Tichon Ironi A (‘TA.1’ or ‘Tichon’) – which had been in operation for just two years.\nDr Cohen gave us a brief account of the courses offered by this school, referring to both the sciences and the humanities and expounded the general value of a sound liberal education to be obtained in such an institution. He added that the original policy of TA.1 had been to accept only the best leavers of primary schools in Tel Aviv. The result was that all pupils came from the leading primary schools in the wealthy suburbs of the town – the haven of the professional classes and their privileged offspring.\nSmiling with satisfaction, Dr. Cohen went on to relate that the admission policy had been revised. In the future, some places would be reserved for leavers of other schools. Each and every one of us should work hard so as to be amongst those worthy of admission. He summed up by saying that, in his youth, he would have laboured to secure entry on merit alone. Hopefully, some of us were made of the same flesh.\n“But, Sir” asked Amram who was always ready to get the ball rolling, “are four years in secondary school going to be of any use if you want to become a jeweller?”\n“Perhaps not directly. But think of the benefit a jeweller would derive from understanding the spirit of Greece and Italy. Wouldn’t such knowledge be invaluable when he sought to take a lead from their great works in gold and silver?”\n“But how about a boy who wants to be a carpenter or a plumber?” asked someone else.\n“A good secondary education is of general benefit,” said Dr. Cohen with conviction. “It gives you a comprehension of the world in which you live and paves the way for an understanding of other cultures and nations. In our time everybody deserves the chance of broadening his horizons. Parochialism was the cause of many disasters in our past. It is the stronghold of hatred, persecution and cruelty.”\nMany of my classmates remained unmoved. They had no wish to face further studies and examinations. Some of them had already enrolled in professional schools or craved to become members of the working force. Secondary schools were for sissies – not for men.\nYet Dr Cohen’s words were not uttered in vain. Some ears – mine included – had listened eagerly to his address. To me, he reinforced the message conveyed by Mrs. Kornmehl: his credo was identical with hers. You had to map your own route to the top; and a sound liberal education was a prerequisite.\nFor the rest of my final year in primary school, I pursued my studies as hard as time permitted. The Yarkon, the beach, the swimming pool, the football grounds and the cinema became out of bounds. My expenditure on such frivolities went down. In contrast, our electricity bills went up: I was studying until late at night. In the event, my efforts bore fruit. My results were amongst the best in Tel Aviv. The gates of TA.1 fell wide open.\n3. TA.1: Early Day. I arrived in the renovated building in Mazor Street some fifteen minutes before the school bell chimed. A list posted on the notice board showed that our intake of one hundred and twenty primary school leavers was split into three classes: one of boys only; one of girls; and the third co-ed. I was glad my name was included in the last. Having had little contact with girls in the past, I was looking forward to this new experience.\nWhen I arrived at our sparsely furnished but spacious classroom, I discovered I was to share a bench with a heavy set, friendly and intelligent looking girl called Shosh Levi. As soon as the bell chimed, the History and Geography Master, Mr. Ben Zvi, who was to be in charge of our Form, made his entrance. Though still young, his hair was already thinning and his old fashioned glasses and severe expression gave him an aura of solemnity. But the warm smile he bestowed on us as he took his seat transformed his face. I concluded he was a friendly and approachable man.\n“Our school’s Principal, Dr. Joseph Katz, will come shortly to address you,” he told us. “If you have any questions, please raise them after you have listened to him. But first I want to tell you about my subjects. In History we’ll discuss this year the Ancient World, touching on Egypt and Mesopotamia but concentrating on Greece and Rome. Have any of you covered the period in primary school? Those who have, please raise your hand.”\n“Nobody,” he muttered when there was no response; “very well, has anyone read about Greece?”\n“I have, Sir,” said a thin boy, wearing a heavy pullover and thick glasses set in a frame too large for his pallid face.\n“Please introduce yourselves; so what have you read?”\n“I’m Eli Berger, Sir,” the boy spoke with patent unease, “and I have read Herodotus, Sir. And I’m trying to read Thucydides; but it is heavy going.”\n“I am sure it is…” started Ben Zvi but cut himself short when the door flew open and a broad shouldered man, dressed in a grey suit complemented with a matching old fashioned tie, burst in.\n“And this is our school’s Principal, Dr. Joseph Katz,” said Ben Zvi. He did not add that, on account of his pie-bald head, our visitor was generally known as ‘Sheen’.\nJoseph Katz looked all of us over. His searching glance made many of us fidget. I knew, instinctively, that our Principal was not a man to be trifled with. Here was a captain determined to be in command of his ship. Any disregard of his orders, or of the school’s discipline, would be treated as mutiny. He would make every effort to nip such opposition in the bud.\n“I have come over in order to acquaint you with the policy of our school,” Sheen went straight to the point. “You are here to get your education for a career in a profession or in the business world. When you have completed your four years with us, you’ll have the necessary background and orientation. On many occasions, you’ll wonder why we work you so hard and why we have made certain core subjects compulsory. In due course, you will appreciate what is behind the drill we are going to put you through. You may grumble while you are with us; later in life you’ll thank us. Well, I hope I’ve made myself clear?”\nEverybody nodded, albeit with varying degrees of enthusiasm. Only one boy raised a question:\n“I’m Reuben Klein, Sir,” he said respectfully. “There is something I don’t understand. If the object is to train us for a future career, why is Biblical Studies a compulsory subject in all four years; and why is Talmudic Studies in the curriculum?\u0026quot;\n“The Old Testament is our national heritage. The school authorities take the view that you must study it. The Talmud is, likewise, a great work. Still – out of tolerance – its study has not been made compulsory.”\n“But what is the object of introducing religious subjects, Sir?” Reuben wanted to know.\n“To help turn you into devoted citizens of the Jewish Nation. We hope Israel will be constituted an independent State before you graduate.”\nNone of us had any comment to make. After a pause, Joseph Katz (alias Sheen) turned to the curriculum. He started by outlining the contents of each compulsory course and then turned to the optionals. A show of hands confirmed that most boys and girls proposed to enrol in the scientific stream. Just ten had set their hearts on the humanities.\n“But why are there only two courses on Music and on Fine Arts?” asked my neighbour, Shosh Levi.\n“Not many of you will choose a career in one of these fields. We leave it to you to get specialised training if you want to be better acquainted with them,” countered Sheen.\n“And why is there no course on drama?” I wanted to know.\n“Same reason,” affirmed the Principal dryly, then – as an after thought – he added: “but the school puts on shows from time-to-time. We invite amateur directors to guide the participants. So we don’t ignore drama altogether.”\nThis brief exchange encouraged some of our scientifically-minded classmates to express their desire to attend courses on topics such as Astronomy. When they were done, Joseph Katz explained that, in addition to our compulsory courses in English, everyone had to study an additional foreign language. Experience, he noted, suggested that Arabic and French were most popular but another language would be offered if at least ten pupils opted for it. In the previous year, for instance, the school had conducted one class in Italian.\n“How about Russian?” asked Shosh.\n“No problem,” confirmed the principal.\n“And how about Polish and German?” asked Reuben.\n“Polish is no problem; but German is not taught,” Sheen’s expression became immobile.\n“It’s the language of Goethe, Schiller and Heine, Sir,” protested Reuben.\n“It is also the language of Adolf Hitler!” countered Joseph Katz.\n“How about Greek or Latin, Sir?” asked Eli.\n“I am afraid not,” Joseph Katz’ tone implied regrets. “The school’s authorities have decided against them.”\n“But, Sir,” intervened Shosh, “shouldn’t we have the chance to get to know the great literatures of the world? Must we be confined to Hebrew, English and French or Arabic literature?”\n“Of course not,” for the first time since he had made his appearance, Joseph Katz let his feelings show. “We have an excellent – really excellent – lending library at school: it holds translations of literary works from all languages, including Russian, Polish, French, German, Spanish, Greek and Latin. I and many staff borrow books regularly. Last week, for instance, I re-read Peer Gynt. Let me tell you how lucky you are. When I went to school in Vilna, I had to learn German to have access to their great classics: now many are available to you in Hebrew translation.”\n“Thank you, Sir,” said Shosh, deeply moved by his response.\nFor a short while, Joseph Katz continued to discuss our school and the courses to be offered to us. He then highlighted the importance of our learning to write clearly and concisely. Composition, he asserted, was both an art and a science. Every graduate of TA.1 had to master it to perfection. When we had nodded our consent, the Principal turned to what he described a sensitive but important issue. Although our school had no official religious orientation, he expected all boys to put on yarmulkes in Biblical and Talmudic Studies classes. Some pupils, he explained, come from orthodox homes and – as matter of tolerance – even those with other backgrounds and outlooks ought to accommodate them.\n“You look ill at ease, Eli Berger,” he said when he concluded his remarks, “is something on your mind?”\n“Sir,” said Eli in a thin, strained voice, “I don’t mind wearing the yarmulke. I sure will. But, Sir, I don’t see why this is a matter of tolerance.”\n“Why then are you prepared to wear it – I assume you are not observant?” asked Joseph Katz.\n“No, I’m not, Sir,” Eli answered with all hesitation gone; “but I think it is only right to be mindful of the feelings of others. So I don’t mind wearing the yarmulke: I don’t want to offend classmates to whom this sort of thing matters.”\n“But isn’t this tolerance?” asked Joseph Katz, intrigued but not angry. “Aren’t you splitting hairs?”\n“I don’t think so, Sir,” Eli had regained his composure. “A majority often seeks to impose its will on a minority in reliance on dogma, such as political views, race or religion. I think it is important to keep the record straight.”\n“I see,” nodded Sheen. “Well, as long as you put on the yarmulke, the point remains academic.”\n“But, as a matter of principle, I do not wish to wear a yarmulke,” interceded Reuben.\n“There is no coercion; we shall demonstrate our tolerance by respecting your views,” put in Ben Zvi, who – like the rest of us – was alarmed by the change in Joseph Katz’s expression.\n“Very well,” agreed our Principal in poor grace. Then, without further ado, he left us.\nWhen he was gone, Ben Zvi took back the lead. To start with, he mentioned that, side by side with our course on Greece and Rome, we would cover the contemporaneous history of Judea. He then referred to the curriculum in Geography. Just before the bell chimed, he read out the duty roster. The students on duty had to wipe the blackboard clean and were to open the windows to let in fresh air. They were also responsible to ensure that nothing was removed from the desks while their mates were in the yard.\nDuring the interval, a number of boys and girls formed a circle around Reuben. Some came to express their approval of his firm stand over the wearing of yarmulkes. Others wanted his advice on the choice of science subjects. Eli, I noticed, stood on his own not far from the staircase. He looked deflated and ill at ease but his expression brightened when my neighbour, Shosh, walked over to his corner.\n“So you like to read the Greeks, Eli,” she said.\n“I do; and you?”\n“I prefer more modern literature – like Gogol and Balzac. But I’ve read some Greek dramas.”\n“Who is your favourite Greek playwright?” he asked eagerly.\n“Aeschylus; I like Prometheus. And yours?”\n“Euripides: he was the greatest ever!”\n“Don’t tell me you like Medea?”\n“I love it,” he conceded apprehensively.\n“But isn’t it a horrible plot? The daughter of the King of Colchis, Medea, helps Jason, the Theban adventurer, to steal her people’s national treasure – the Golden Fleece – and elopes with him. Then, as he prepares to jilt her and marry a younger and prettier woman, she sends the bride a beautiful gown, which sets the poor girl on fire when she puts it on. Medea then murders her own children by Jason to break his heart. What’s so wonderful about that?”\n“Medea’s speeches,” said Eli, “are unsurpassed. Euripides made me believe that such a story was feasible; that it could have really happened this way. Medea is the woman scorned in her supreme manifestation. I wish I could read it in Greek!”\nEli spoke with such zest – gesticulating widely with his hands – that Shosh bestowed on him a warm sisterly smile. Finding the subject interesting, I stepped over:\n“May I join you?”\n“Of course,” Shosh took the lead, “Eli and I are talking about Medea.”\n“I heard; and I don’t like the play.”\n“Why?” asked Eli, letting his disappointment show.\n“The only good role is Medea. Jason is an insipid character. I don’t want to play him.”\n“So you want to be an actor?” asked Shosh.\n“I do!”\n“And what is your favourite role,” asked Eli eagerly.\n“Tevyeh the Milkman.”\nEli’s keen reaction indicated that he was familiar with the drama. Shosh, too, knew it. I believe she realised that Tevyeh was not an easy role to play. The actor had be able to manifest the humorous aspect of this complex character, such as his soliloquy of what he would do if he were a rich man, as well a Tevyeh’s ability to stand his ground when he felt the need.\n“A fine choice,” she said, “and you have the required physique.”\n“Quite,” agreed Eli, “but, Chayim: how about the scene where Tevyeh repudiates his daughter when she comes to placate him after her elopement with the Cossack? Will you be able to handle it?”\n“It is a challenging episode,” I nodded, “but I’m sure I can pull it off. And where have you seen the play?”\n“I haven’t,” conceded Eli, “I read a German translation last year. Mother got it from a German lending library. Later on I found the Hebrew translation. The Yiddish original, which comprises a number of stories, is too difficult.”\n“I’ve read it,” volunteered Shosh, “it’s great. And Tevyeh is a more interesting role than Jason.”\n“Jason is a very different type.” observed Eli.\n“What sort of ‘type’?” I asked him.\n“A pipsqueak. Somebody like Reuben,” grinned Eli, “full of himself when the pickings are good and down – all the way down – when the cards are stacked against him.”\n“Why this contempt?” Shosh was taken aback.\n“Because that fellow will wear a yarmulke if it serves his purpose; and I only wish I had kept my big mouth shut when Sheen raised that subject. I made a mess.”\n“You had every reason to put our Sheen right,” I volunteered. “He is a bully.”\n“I agree,” said Shosh.\nThe bell summoned us back to class. All of us found Mr. Klein, the Mathematics Master, amusing. He drew triangles, circles and quadrangles on the blackboard and turned our attention to parabolas and hyperbolas. He then observed that his favourite actress, Ingrid Bergman, was a cross of both. The English Master, Dr. Simon, talked to us about Shakespeare and Milton. He then taught us a song. The resonance of his fine tenor made me recall an anecdote I had been told by an older boy. Once upon a time, Simon taught his pupils the song about Simple Simon and the Pie-man. As was to be expected, the name stuck. Rumour had it that good old Simon (whose proper name had remained a mystery) was proud of his nickname.\nThe next to address us was Mr. Vered, the Arabic Master. He made it clear he had come to sell his product and, to leave an impression, highlighted the elegance of Classic Arabic and the beauty of the poetry and prose to be covered.\n“But, Sir,” interjected Reuben, “isn’t Arabic a primitive language: uncultured and monotonous?”\n“Now, who told you that?”\n“Nobody; but it sounds awful.”\n“Where have you heard it?”\n“In the markets and shops in Jaffa and Ramleh; and I’ve never been told anything good about Arabic literature.”\n“But it is silly to judge something you know nothing about,’” countered Vered. “And as regards the sound: which market slang sounds good?”\nReuben did not reply. The exchange of words firmed my decision to enrol in Arabic rather than French: I was impressed with Vered’s handling of his childish heckler.\nThe last class before the lunch break was conducted by the Biology teacher: an attractive woman in her mid-thirties. The male population of the class stared at her with undisguised admiration. The girls – some of whom were still flat-chested – bestowed on her hostile glances. Ms Garten’s manner, though, was so pleasant and unassuming that, after a while, the girls were converted from an antagonistic to an appreciative audience.\nUsually, most pupils would have gone home for lunch at 1.00 p.m. As a rule, homework was supposed to keep us well-occupied during the afternoon. You returned to school in the afternoon only if you were enrolled in certain optional subjects.\nThis first day, though, was exceptional: Ben Zvi asked us to stay behind. The Form would proceed to elect a committee, whose tasks were to represent us in dealings with the school authorities and to take charge of our entertainment programme.\nSeveral names, including Reuben’s, were put forward at the outset. Before we went ahead, my neighbour, Shosh, voiced her concern:\n“But we’ve just met, Sir. How then can we make a meaningful selection of candidates?”\n“Some of us make our minds up forthwith and trust our instincts,” observed Reuben.\n“Only to be proved wrong in due course,” I thought it right to interject.\nIn the heated debate that followed Ben Zvi remained aloof. It was brought to an end when Eli suggested that, just this time, we elect a provisional committee, to serve for only one term. Reluctantly, Reuben and his supporters agreed.\nAs was to be expected, Reuben was elected chairman. Both Shosh and I were elected members. Eli appeared gratified to remain on the fringes. At Ben Zvi’s suggestion, our committee undertook to have its inaugural meeting before the end of the week. One of our responsibilities was to organise the first Kumsitz – an Israeli picnic – which, Ben Zvi insisted, everyone ought to attend.\nAs we walked back, Eli turned into Melchett Street where, I gathered, his parents had their flat. He was breathing hard and his expression was strained. I sensed that he was having an attack of asthma.\nShosh and I walked in the opposite direction. Before she caught the bus to her home, she suggested I entertain our classmates by reciting in our forthcoming Kumsitz one of Tevyeh’s soliloquies and by reading out modern Hebrew poems. I was happy to agree.\nKumsitz – literally ‘come and sit down’ – is an inapt description of the famed Israeli picnic. To start with, strangers are not expected to partake and would never dream of dropping in and joining the party. In our era, the Kumsitz was a gathering of a socially closed circle. In addition, ‘sitting down’ to philosophize was not on the agenda. The atmosphere was too light-hearted for such serious interaction. Usually simple dishes were cooked on an open fire or in holes dug into the ground and people passed trays of food and cans of soft drinks around, told jokes and short stories and, eventually, all danced the Horah to the tune of folksongs. Anybody who played the accordion or the guitar was expected to bring his music with him: even if his (or her) performance was painful to the ears.\nOur Form’s first Kumsitz was held some ten days after the commencement of term. Hoping to pass the buck, the members of our Committee, spurred by the redoubtable Reuben, elected me Master of the Ceremony. So I had to get a few loaves of bread, potatoes, three bags of coffee and refreshments befitting the occasion. Having picked a suitable spot on the bank of the Yarkon River, I arrived early in order to dig holes for the cooking of the potatoes. Ben Zvi, who arrived in the company of Eli shortly after I got the kettle to boil, gave me a helping hand. Eli, who was breathing hard after their brisk walk along Disengoff Street, watched us keenly with a sad expression. Once again, I sensed he was too proud to initiate the overtures for a friendship.\n“A shy lad,” I concluded.\nBy the time most of our classmates had arrived, the preparations for the festivities were in an advanced state. Reuben, who was one of the last to turn up, drew attention to himself by reciting a well-known recent poem. An attractive girl, called Orna, followed in his step, entertaining us with a solo ballet. Although the performer’s choreography left much to be desired, her dexterous movements displayed her figure to its best. The boys – including both the boisterous Reuben and the shy Eli – applauded enthusiastically while the female members of audience watched her with envy. When Orna finished, another girl, Nurit, entertained us by playing folksongs on her harmonica. Before long, our untrained voices provided a befitting chorus for her performance.\nAfter Nurit curtsied in royal fashion to acknowledge our applause, Shosh nudged me to take the lead. My recital of two well-known poems met a civil reception. The atmosphere changed when I recited Tevyeh’s famed soliloquy: ‘if I were a rich man’. My classmates were galvanised by the sentiments and demonstrated their appreciation with enthusiastic clapping. To reward them I proceeded with Tevyeh’s narration of his ‘dream’. When I finished, everybody was roaring with sympathetic laughter. Obviously, Shalom Aleichem’s work had not lost its impact during the 70 years that had elapsed since it had been written.\nWhen I finished, Ben Zvi induced us to revert to folksongs. When the atmosphere warmed up, we danced the Horah and other Eastern European dances. It was a tiring exercise and, after a while, some boys and girls dropped out. When, at long last, the circle broke up, Eli stepped over and shook my hand shyly.\n“What a splendid performance of Tevyeh, Chayim. I’d love to see you doing the Mayor in The Country Inspector.”\n“I’ll give it a try,” I promised. “Still, at the moment, I’m having a go at Peer Gynt.”\n“John Falstaff may be more in line,” he observed.\n“I agree,” said Shosh, who had joined us; “and perhaps try The Malade Imaginaire. But you better watch your deportment.”\n“I’ll do my best,” I grinned, elated by the success of the party.\nIt was close to midnight when we called it a day. To ensure the fire was out, we heaped sand over it and two boys went to carry water from the Yarkon. Then Eli had a bright idea:\n“How about an Operation Gulliver?” he asked.\n“A what?” asked Orna.\n“The girls would have to close their eyes,” guffawed Reuben, who grasped the point.\n“Oh,” said Shosh, when the penny dropped.\nThe arrival of two pails of water saved us the need to put the radical proposal up for a vote. Ben Zvi, I noticed, looked much relieved. When the picnic site had been tidied up, we made our departure. Reuben and Orna were amongst the first to leave. Shortly after they were gone, Shosh asked Eli to chaperon her back. I was moved by the happiness that descended on his face. Ben Zvi and I were the last to start on the way back.\n“This was a good function, Chayim,” he observed.\n“I’m glad you enjoyed it, Sir. And I think so did everybody.”\n“They did indeed,” he agreed.\nOur first Kumsitz broke the barriers of the reserve typical of adolescents of our era. When Ben Zvi fostered it on us, he had hit the nail on its head. Soon our Form got renowned for our Kumsitzes and parties. Unlike our rival Forms, we became a social conclave. True, the change was not of a formal nature. The membership of our Committee remained static and Reuben was regularly re-elected Chairman. In our dealings with the school authorities, with our teachers and even with Ben Zvi himself, he remained the spokesman. Yet the influence centre in the Form itself shifted in my direction, with Shosh and shy Eli often stepping in when support was needed. Slowly but surely, the three of us became the nerve centre of the group; and I was the effective leader.\nI was proud of the social recognition conferred on me in this manner but needed some skill to handle the demands it made on my time. Although my brother, David, was growing up fast I had remained the family’s main breadwinner. Fortunately, the newspaper franchise was becoming lucrative so that I was able to slow down on my odd jobbing and, in due course, left much of it to David. Another stroke of good luck was that the newspapers came off the printing press one hour earlier than during my primary school days. As a result, I was able to pick up the papers and distribute them to my subscribers in the early hours of the morning, arriving in TA.1 some 15 minutes before classes started. Frequently, I walked along Masor Street to the gate at the very time the Principal, Dr. Joseph Katz (alias Sheen), took his leisurely stroll to his office.\nAnother favourable development enabled me to curtail my odd jobbing even further. Two of my former teachers at primary started to send me boys who required tuition in Basic Mathematics, Biblical Studies and Hebrew Grammar. Teaching these dunces was dull; but the money was good. Before long, my takings sufficed to keep our household going and, in addition, provided ample pocket money for David and myself. I was even able to stand my Mother – whose health was failing – a holiday in Tiberias. Regrettably, the famed waters of the once volcanic resort did her no good.\nMost of my time in those days was taken up with my schooling. The drill at TA.1 was harsh. My pet subjects – Arabic, Biblical Studies and Talmudic Studies – required concentration and extra reading: they were time consuming. So was the endless array of essays and reports we had to submit to our teacher in Composition, who was none other than the Principal himself. All of us – including the resilient Reuben – feared the lashes of Sheen’s sharp tongue and his merciless dissection of our written work. Eli alone did on occasion stand up to him. But Eli, too, flinched when Sheen went berserk over a clumsy sentence or ungrammatical phrase in one of Eli’s compositions. The clash in philosophies became apparent during one brief exchange:\n“But surely, Sir,” Eli protested; “any reader would understand what I was driving at even if I used a plain instead of an inverted subjunctive?”\n“But he would have to reflect for a moment.”\n“Isn’t that desirable? Shouldn’t ‘the reader’ be made to think?”\n“Not a bad after-thought, Eli Berger. Still, you want the reader to reflect on the substance; not on your mode of expression.”\n“What a pity Adam didn’t when Eve tempted him with that apple. If he had, we might still be in Paradise.”\n“And I would be spared the need to comment on your grammar,” guffawed Joseph Katz as he often did when a favoured pupil sought to beat off his onslaught. To my relief, Eli joined in our laughter: he had not taken offence.\nAny time left when I finished my chores was devoted to training for my future career on the stage. I had by then set my heart on it and, mercilessly, used my classmates as a captive audience. Luckily, they appreciated my performances in our Kumsitzes and parties. Even Reuben and Orna – who had become close – clapped enthusiastically when I performed passages from Peer Gynt, Tevyeh the Milkman or the Malade Imaginaire. The only negative development was my acquisition of a ridiculous nickname: ‘Pilkin’, which means “the Little Elephant”. Still, Eli, who initiated this offensive move, had to pay dearly for his lack of reverence. In our very next Kumsitz, I dubbed him Bushi – ‘the shy lad’. The public reaction was predictable: each of us had to wear his laurel for life.\nDespite the constant pressure I was subjected to, I found life in TA.1 satisfying. Our teachers were devoted to their jobs and most of them conducted interesting and stimulating classes. My classmates turned out to be a congenial lot. Even Reuben became bearable once you realised that his bark was worse than his bite. As long as you played up to his vanity, he was ready and willing to do you a good turn. When needed, he stepped in to assist Eli, Shosh or me when one of the Science Teachers found our performance unsatisfactory. We, in turn, got him out of trouble when he goofed in one of the Humanist subjects, such as Arabic or History.\nThe ‘Interest Streams’ – the Humanities and the Sciences – provided the main yardstick for the division of our Form into groupings. It was only natural that when the ‘scientists’ had a class in one of their mysterious subjects, the ‘humanists’ – including Eli, Shosh and me – had to find something else to do. Usually we spent the time in the library but, occasionally, wandered off to a pita-falafel stall or to a soft drinks kiosk, discussing on our way politics or recent popular books or plays.\nOn these occasions, Shosh – heavy set, dark eyed and effervescent – took the lead. Like many high-spirited and self-assured girls, she had firm opinions on most current topics and on life itself and believed in converting others to her views. Eli and I tended to nod when she preached and smiled tolerantly when – in the course of her address – she caught her breath and quickly took a bite from my large portion or from Eli’s half portion of pita-falafel. The two of us – Shosh’s ardent friends and admirers – had long come to terms with the vagaries of her gluttony.\nSex, too, divided our Form into groups. During breaks between classes, girls congregated to discuss boys while the boys – converging somewhere nearby – talked about the girls. The fantasies some chaps told (in loud undertone) to their cronies make me blush to this very day. Suffice it to say that – in reality – all of us, without exception, were still innocent. I suspect that so were the young ladies; but I hasten to admit that here I rely on my impressions which – according to Professor Emeritus Dr. Peter Berger (formerly Eli Berger, alias Bushi) – constitute hearsay evidence and hence are inadmissible in a court of justice (whatever this may mean).\nAlthough some of the boys were handsome and many of the girls cute, only Reuben and Orna had a steady relationship. Other boys and girls went out together on occasions – to the theatre, to a cinema or to a concert – but did not form romantic associations. In years to come, most girls attached themselves to men older than us. Those who are still alive have turned into respectable grandmothers. Shosh, for instance, has four ainiklach (grandchildren); and she boasts a triple chin.\nYet another – less evident – grouping was dictated by backgrounds. Those who came from orthodox homes were drawn together and, from-time-to-time, conversed in Yiddish. Two Sephardic boys and one girl from Athens forged another alliance. Quite a number of my own mates came from Russian and Polish homes and – after a while – Reuben, whose parents had fled from Warsaw and then from Munich, became friendly with Bushi, who spoke German with his Viennese parents. Integration in our emerging society – I concluded – was not as profound as we liked to believe: Tel Aviv was a cosmopolitan town but not a melting pot.\nI recall many interesting incidents that took place during my first two years in TA.1 but am going to mention only three of them. The first occurred when Simple Simon covered Macbeth. Seeking to highlight Shakespeare’s masterly command of words and imagery, he chanted “knock, knock, knock…”, banged his desk enthusiastically and asked us to close our eyes and visualise somebody standing at our ‘gate’ ready to enter. We did and, instantly, gasped when the door flew open and our venerated Principal, Dr. Joseph Katz (alias Sheen), burst in. He had been on one of his inspection tours when Simple Simon’s intemperate banging disturbed his meditations.\n“What’s going on?” he bellowed.\n“Mr Simon, Sir, is explaining to us the knocking on the gate in Macbeth,” volunteered Orna.\n“And so you thought I was the odd man out seeking to get in. Lucky Mr. Simon wasn’t discussing Hamlet’s ghost.” Simple Simon blushed scarlet while we roared our heads off.\nThe second incident, too, related to Sheen; but it was no laughing matter. It took place at the start of our second year in the school during a Biblical Studies Class. The teacher, Dr. Frank, fondly nicknamed ‘Old Frank’, was the martyr; Sheen was the villain.\nOld Frank was an odd figure. I know nothing about his life in Marburg and very little about his teaching career in Tel Aviv prior to his appointment at TA.1. When we came across him, he was close to retirement, a bowed old man, with remnants of white hair on his head. Unlike other teachers, he wore a tie and a jacket, which, however, did not disguise the shabbiness of his clothes and his untidy appearance. His brilliant eyes were his redeeming feature. They sparkled when he taught his beloved subject: the Old Testament.\nIn our era, his teaching was unconventional. Old Frank treated the Bible as a great literary work and analysed it as such. His modern exegesis – based on a minute dissection of the text – attracted radicals like Reuben and rationalists like Bushi. But from time-to-time, Old Frank upset orthodox pupils like me. We were threatened by the doubts he cast on the authenticity and historicity of the Holy Book and by his demonstration that our text was a corrupted version. Still, the man’s sincerity and intellectual honesty disarmed us.\nWe also dismissed with a grin his incessant struggle with his yarmulke. In conformity with the school’s code, Old Frank covered his head at the start of each class; but, as it progressed, the worn-out piece of black cloth came unstuck, usually sliding down as he gesticulated wildly. Patiently, Old Frank would put it back on top of his thin white hair only to have it come off again within the next few minutes. In the end, Old Frank would fold his headwear and place it, symbolically, next to the Bible in front of him.\nThe incident I have in mind occurred when Sheen stepped into our Form while Old Frank was countering an argument raised by Bushi about an obscure verse in the Book of Job. Bushi, who had not shown an interest in the classes of the pedantic teacher we had in our first year, admired our new Biblical Studies Teacher. Sometimes he even accompanied him on the way back from school, although this way he had to take a longer route back to his own home. In class, the two often engaged in lively exchanges.\nLike all orthodox Jews, Sheen was perturbed by this modern stream of Bible Critique. Still, TA.1’s pedagogical orientation was liberal. True, every teacher had to exercise the discretion conferred on him within reasonable limits. Old Frank’s analysis did not overstep the mark. In consequence, Sheen – whose eyes kept straying to the folded yarmulke – had no sound basis for any objection. Moreover, the class was lively, well planned and instructive. All the same, our Principal kept fidgeting. Then, without warning, he let his chagrin show:\n“Our School’s Regulations, Dr. Frank, require teachers to wear their yarmulkes throughout Biblical Study Classes,” he said sternly.\n“I am sorry, Dr Katz… it kept… falling off,” Old Frank stammered apologetically and hastily replaced the discarded yarmulke on his balding head.\n“Please be more mindful in the future,” rebuked Sheen and departed.\nAll of us were uncomfortable. Bushi turned pale. The situation was saved by Orna, whose outlook on life was sedate and mature.\n“Please, Sir,” she implored, “do tell us what you think about the authorship and the object of the Book of Job. We have concentrated on the passages you’ve prescribed. But we are keen to have your own construction of the work as a whole.”\nWillingly, Old Frank embarked on a lengthy, lucid even if unorthodox, analysis. Recovering from his shock, he soon became his old sparkling self and once again his yarmulke slipped off.\nAs soon as the class was over, Bushi asked Reuben to convene an emergency meeting of our Committee. He wanted us to convey the protest of the Form directly to Sheen, insisting that even those who disapproved of Old Frank’s approach to Biblical Studies were bound to realise that a rebuke of a well established teacher in front of the entire class was improper. Although not a member of the Committee, Bushi was prepared to act as spokesman. Reuben and Shosh agreed and suggested we accept his offer. For once, I felt it necessary to apply the brakes.\n“This morning Orna saved the situation,” I pointed out. “Confronting Sheen is putting the fat into the fire. The Regulations do require our teachers to observe certain rules. We may turn a mere incident into an altercation.”\n“But we ought not to countenance Sheen’s bullying! He acted disgracefully,” interceded Reuben.\n“I agree,” said Shosh, “silence in such a situation is acquiescence.”\n“True,” nodded Orna; “but what will we achieve by confronting Sheen? He is good on the uptake and has authority on his side. Why don’t we first talk to Ben Zvi: he is in charge of our Form.”\n“Good idea,” said Bushi who, so I had noticed, was often looking at Orna surreptitiously.\nBen Zvi had been anticipating our visit. He was out of countenance and appeared on the defensive.\n“You’ve come to see me about Dr. Katz’s reprimand of Dr Frank,” he went to the point.\n“We have,” said Reuben, “it was a disgraceful attack.”\n“The School’s Regulations are clear,” replied Ben Zvi, “teachers are obliged to cover their heads in Biblical Studies Classes.”\n“Dr. Katz could have told Frank off in private; not in front of the class,” said Shosh. “How can the Principal expect us to respect our teachers if he disgraces them in public.”\n“Now, now,” Ben Zvi sought to place things in context, “let’s not get melodramatic.”\n“But this is exactly what had happened,” I stepped in.\n“Well, what do you want me to do?” asked our teacher.\n“Ask Dr. Katz to apologise,” demanded Reuben.\n“Surely, a public apology will only exacerbate the situation. I am, actually, sure Dr. Katz regrets his outburst. Dr. Frank has already talked to me and I have made an appointment to see Dr. Katz. Mr Simon has volunteered to come with me. We’ll ask Dr. Katz to express his regrets to Dr. Frank. This way, we should all be in a position to put the event behind us and return to business as normal.”\n“I think that’s good enough,” stepped in Orna. “Dr. Frank is a controversial figure. His views are unpopular with some members of the Form. So the less said the better. If Dr. Frank is satisfied with a personal retraction we ought to dismiss the incident from our minds. We don’t want to create a stink.”\n“I couldn’t agree more,” I said in support. “Dr. Frank is a great scholar and he loves his subject. But he is unorthodox. Publicity is not wanted in such a case.”\nShosh and Reuben nodded their consent. All eyes were now turned to Bushi. After a short reflection he, too, signified his consent.\nThe third event took place in one of Ms. Garten’s biology classes. Having pointed out to us the unique nature and the advantages of the human arm and hands, she added that their perfection was part of an evolutionary process, separating Man from Apes. Instantly one of our orthodox classmates, Arieh, insisted that evolution was a questionable and outdated doctrine. In his eyes, our teacher had demonstrated the perfection of the Good Lord’s creation.\nAfter a quick exchange of glances, Reuben stepped in and spoke strongly in support of the doctrine of evolution. In his eyes, evolution was more convincing than a doctrine postulating the creation of something from nothing.\nA heated discussion followed. Before long, Bushi and Orna stepped into the arena in support of Reuben’s arguments. Quite a few others expressed their firm support for Arieh’s view. In the end, I felt the need to step in.\n“But surely, ‘evolution’ and ‘creation’ are complementary. Someone – we say ‘God’ – instigated evolution.”\n“Chayim Rosenberg is right,” conceded our teacher. She then pointed out that our subject was biology and so we had better stick to it and leave doctrinal issues to philosophers and theologians. Shortly thereafter, the chime of the bell terminated our class.\nWhilst the doctrinal issues involved were not brought up again, Ms. Garten, who was an ardent believer in evolution, offered extra tuition to interested students. Shosh and I did not attend these.\n4. The Independence Struggle During my first two years in TA.1, the Jewish community – the Yishuv – was governed from London. Palestine was ruled by Great Britain under a mandate granted to Her by the League of Nations after the culmination of World War I. The British had the difficult task of pacifying both the Yishuv and the Arab Community.\nSome towns, such as Jerusalem and Haifa, were populated by both Jews and Arabs. Most places, though, were inhabited virtually in their entirety by one of the communities. For instance, Tel Aviv, Herzlia and Nahariya were Jewish towns; Jaffa, Ramallah and Nablus (Shechem) were populated by Arabs.\nHistorically, the Yishuv craved independence or, in other words, for home rule. The Arab League, which comprised most Islamic States, claimed that Palestine was part of the Muslim World.\nNotably, World War II had left no direct impact on most of us, including Bushi (Eli) and Reuben. We had been too young to have personal recollections of the Holocaust. Naturally, we sensed the trepidation that engulfed the Yishuv whenever Rommel threatened Tobruk. Life, though, had to go on as normal: shops were open and schools remained in session.\nThe battle for the foundation of an independent Jewish state, which commenced soon after the defeat of Germany in 1945, had a direct bearing on our lives. The smuggling of immigrants into the country and the preparations for the forthcoming struggle with the Arab world made demands even on youngsters like us. Being the fittest and most mature boy in our Form, I became the liaison between my mates and the Haganah – the freedom fighters. Our tasks were menial in nature but played their role in our struggle.\nOne amusing event took place on a dark night when Shosh and I were sent to the beach in Tel Aviv, near Frischman Street, to communicate with a ship smuggling in illegal migrants from Europe. Shosh was signalling with her heavy, square, electric torch when we heard the sound of an approaching jeep and realised it had to be an army patrol.\n“Quick; hug me,” hissed Shosh and threw herself into my arms.\nAs expected, the well-bred British servicemen were too discreet to disturb a necking couple. As soon as they were gone, Shosh released herself, twitching with the pain inflicted by the electric torch that had been sandwiched between us. When she recovered, we faced a practical problem: we had to keep signalling but without being detected. In the end, I suggested that Shosh use the electric torch from under the entrance of the deserted public shower.\n“But don’t you dare step in with me,” commanded Shosh; “I’m not stepping into a shower with a man!”\n“I’ll stay outside and tell you when it’s safe to signal. And you better ask them to wait until we confirm it’s secure to land!”\nAs the lights of the jeep kept sweeping the beach, the human cargo had to wait for almost two hours. Shivering with the cold and soaked to the bone after a rough landing, the refugees were relieved to be escorted to their temporary hideout near the beach.\nShosh looked thoughtful as I escorted her back. To my surprise, she turned down a pita-falafel and appeared uninterested even in a glass of Gazoz, the Israeli national soft drink. I realised that the plight of the refugees had perturbed her.\n“Chayim,” she said after a while, addressing me by my proper name and not by my nickname, “I hope these poor people will fit in. They won’t find it easy; I bet they don’t speak Hebrew!”\n“They’ll have to learn it! And, Shosh, they are lucky not to have perished in the Holocaust! I’m sure they’ve taught themselves to adapt!”\n“We are the lucky ones, Chayim,” protested Shosh. “We may not have had it all that easy. I’ve not forgotten what you’ve told me about yourself; and I’ve been cooking and helping Mom to look after the house and my three young brothers since I was six years old; and Dad’s a bully! But at least we’ve not known the hardship these poor devils have been through!”\n“True; but – you know – they are at home now!”\n“Let’s hope they find it welcoming!”\nAfter this brief exchange of words, both of us remained silent. When I reached my own home, I was dead tired. All the same, I got up in time next morning and delivered the newspapers to my clients: I was young, energetic and strong.\nAnother hazardous task entrusted to us was the carrying of arms. Although we were too young to be enlisted in the Haganah, we were occasionally called in when a cache came under surveillance. Our appearance in the vicinity was less noticeable than that of adults. Usually we were sent to the spot in the late afternoon and emerged with our loads after dusk. Getting caught was a serious matter.\nA particularly unpleasant engagement of this sort took place one afternoon, when a team of chess players of TA.1 faced opponents from our rival school, TA.2. The tournament was drawing to its close, when our Games and Fitness Trainer, Amnon, who was also the contact man of the Haganah, entered the room unobtrusively and told us help was urgently needed. The cache in Ramat Gan had come under ‘observation’ so that the arms had to be moved to another place as soon as possible.\nReuben had to be counted out. His possessive and excitable mother was bound to make a fuss if he came home late. Two of the boys from TA.2 had to attend evening classes: their absence could be noticed by a ‘wrong person’. In consequence, we were one man short. To my surprise, Bushi, who was playing our Third Chess Board, volunteered.\n“But won’t your mother get worried?” asked Amnon.\n“I told her I might go out for a pita-falafel and to the cinema; so she’d be alright,” said Bushi.\n“But are you fit enough?” I asked him. “It’s only three weeks since you recovered from that bout of bronchitis. An asthma attack could cause a problem in this sort of thing!”\n“I’ll be alright,” he assured me. “Please let me come; I don’t want to be kept out of everything. I won’t let you down!”\n“Very well, then” I said, lacking the heart to refuse and ignoring Amnon’s anxious glance.\nBushi and I were driven to target and alighted some 200 metres from the house. Amnon warned us that two soldiers were on the lookout a few doors away from our destination. If they stopped us we were to act naturally and should tell them we came to visit a boy called Shim’on in Flat 4. At 7.30 p.m. we were to leave from the back entrance and carry the arms entrusted to us to a pick-up point along the road. There we would deliver them to a van driven by Amnon. He was to dim the lights three times just before he reached the rendezvous.\nFortunately, I saw the soldiers before they spotted us.\n“Bushi,” I told him as I pulled him roughly into a doorway, “that big trooper over there saw me on a previous engagement. He may remember me and get suspicious!”\n“So what shall we do?” asked Bushi anxiously.\n“You must go to Flat 4 on your own. I’ll wait for you behind the block at 7.35 p.m. Tell them to guide you to where they took me last time. From there we’ll trudge to the pick up point together.”\n“But, Pilkin,” he pointed out, “I can’t carry two loads of the stuff; shall I go twice?”\n“Too dangerous! Our chaps in the flat will send somebody with you. He’ll carry my load! And look: I’ll watch out from here while you walk onward. If there’s any trouble I’ll create a diversion.”\n“There’ll be no need for it, Pilkin!” he assured me.\nAmnon kept the engine running as the precious arms were placed in his van. As soon as the cargo was on board, he drove off. Feeling satisfied with the success of the mission, I led the long way back to Tel Aviv. We walked briskly until, some ten minutes after we started, I heard Bushi’s wheeze. Looking him over anxiously, I saw his brow was wet and his face flushed.\n“Is it bad?” I asked.\n“I’ll manage; just keep walking!”\n“Shall we try to bum a ride?”\n“Good idea,” he agreed in a croaking voice.\nA British army jeep stopped readily as I lifted my arm. Initially, the soldiers looked at us suspiciously but, after a glance at Bushi’s face, one of them told us to get in.\n“Please drop us at the corner of Maze Street. I’ll take him to emergency,” I explained.\n“Sure,” said the trooper and, when he saw Bushi was shivering in the breeze of the open jeep, dropped a blanket over his shoulders. “When did you get it?”\n“When I was 5. I hope it’ll get better when I grow up.”\n“My brother got over it,” volunteered the trooper. “Let’s hope you’ll be all right.”\nWhen we arrived at the corner of Maze Street, the trooper had a hushed word with the driver. To my relief, they dropped us in front of the emergency entrance of Hadassah Hospital. Fifteen minutes later, following an injection and a cup of hot tea, Bushi’s breathing steadied and the colour returned to his face. The duty physician asked me to take him home forthwith: he needed a hot bath and a rest.\nAs we walked out of the hospital Bushi observed: “those soldiers were decent to us.”\n“Weren’t they ever!”\n“But they’re supposed to be ‘the enemy’; except that only two years ago these very soldiers were our buffer against Rommel. Isn\u0026rsquo;t it all crazy?\u0026quot;\n“I suppose it is; but why do you bring this up; what’s the matter, Bushi? You don’t regret having carried arms?”\n“Of course not, Pilkin. I had to prove – to myself if not to others – that I had the guts. No I don’t ‘regret’ our operation. That’s not the point, Pilkin.”\n“So what is it?”\n“I don’t feel any hatred for these so called enemies.”\n“But you believe in the cause?”\n“I’m in support,” he mumbled.\nBushi remained quiet as we walked on. I sensed he wanted to get something off his chest but was deterred by his desire to avoid controversy. When, at long last, he broke his silence, his words were revealing.\n“You are a believer, Pilkin,” he said. “I don’t want to hurt your feelings. So perhaps I better keep my big moth shut.”\n“Don’t be silly,” I chided him. “I am not a fanatic!”\n“All right then,” he proceeded. “Our religion, just like Christianity, postulates an almighty and perfect God, who created the universe and made Man in His own image. But are we perfect? Wars, cruelty and wanton destruction are common. Your friend of today may be a bitter enemy tomorrow. And think about the universe, is it perfect? How many natural disasters do we – on this earth alone – encounter every year?”\n“So?” I asked, thinking it best to hold my gun.\n“So how could a perfect and loving God produce something as imperfect as the universe and – on top of it – create ‘in his own image’ a race as crude as mankind? Does the occasional kindness we meet redeem the imperfection of his product?”\n“We have read a great deal about this, Bushi. You know there is no rational answer. Even the existence of God cannot be established by deduction. Philosophers who tried failed miserably. Most ‘systems’ are based on an axiom, accepting his existence.”\n“What then enables you to believe?” he asked.\n“An act of faith; an emotive conviction that He is – must be – there. And, Bushi, without my faith I should be in a wilderness, in which dog eats dog. If you don’t have faith, why don’t you postulate that ‘might is right’?”\n“Because we are herd animals. We exist as a pack: so we have a social appetite which enables the group to survive. You know all about this theory.”\n“I do. But how do you answer all the questions that bog us down?”\n“By saying openly: ‘I don’t know’. Your answer is: ‘only God knows and He is so great that I can’t question Him’.”\n“This belief makes certain things bearable,” I reminded him.\n“I know: but I can’t reach out; I can’t find faith. You are fortunate: I envy you.”\n“One day you might find it!”\n“Maybe,” he retorted, unconvinced.\nWe had by then reached the three-story apartment block in which he lived. I waited in front of it until I saw the light being switched on in his room. Firm in my decision to keep the events of the evening to myself, I started the long walk home.\nThe smuggling of refugees (we called them ‘Ma’Apilim’) into Palestine gained momentum during the post WWII years. Basically, the idea was to land them in stretches of the Mediterranean beach which were not patrolled. In addition, the landing place had to be near a town or village populated by the Yishuv. I was often involved in operations that took place near Tel Aviv. My function in such cases was to act as guide for Ma’Apilim, who landed near the north shore of Tel Aviv. I recall one occasion, in which I guided a small group to a designated house in Tel Aviv. To my surprise the contact person who met us was our Ms Garten, the biology teacher. She was just as astounded as I when we met. Naturally, the episode was not mentioned when both of us arrived next morning in TA.1.\nOur struggle intensified from year-to-year. In due course, even boys and girls younger than us were enlisted. On several assignments I took David with me. He proved both resilient and reliable.\nThe top priority in all these cases was the maintenance of secrecy. We had to beware of informers who might betray us. I recall, in particular, one episode in the Galilee where such a sneak led the British security forces to a cachet of arms. Quislings existed in many of the Yishuv’s settlements.\nSuch double-crossers would be able to read messages written in Hebrew. Initially, we were asked to use a cipher – based on the famed Caesar’s Code – in which a word would be spelt by using for each letter the one preceding it in the alphabet. The defect of such a code was that it could be readily broken – or ‘deciphered’ – by any reasonably intelligent person.\nThere was a need for a better system. The problem, though, was to choose a cryptogram that should not be too difficult to use. Messages had to be delivered promptly and the time for decoding was limited. I gather that different systems were used throughout the Yishuv. In the event, the task of determining a suitable code for our region was entrusted to me. Initially, I was surprised. Tel Aviv boasted many linguistic and history scholars who might have been more suitable candidates. I then recalled that ours was an elitist school, which accepted only the best primary school leavers. Our superiors concluded that we were more likely to come up with a solution than members of the older generation.\nKnowing that I was out of my depth, I enlisted Reuben’s aid. I knew he was trustworthy but feared that his product might be on the complex side. To my dismay, my misgivings were justified. Reuben’s idea was to induce all transmitters to memorise a chapter of our Bible and use the first twenty two letters of it as our alphabet. Reuben, who was renowned for his excellent memory, was surprised when our superiors concluded that his code was too complex and, in addition, would be broken if anybody observed the deciphering of a message.\nAn unexpected suggestion was made by Bushi, who had a keen interest in the old cultures of the Levant. Pointing out that all our proposals were based on the use of an alphabet, he suggested that we move to a syllabary. By memorising some 54 characters, such a code could be used effectively and without any difficulty or time delay in decoding. Further, it was not easy to break.\nTo my satisfaction, Reuben embraced the idea enthusiastically. With his assistance we settled on a script of syllables based on an ancient Semitic language. In the event, we made do with just 44 symbols. It pleased me to observe how Bushi and Reuben, who were not close, collaborated so as to present to us a well-defined and workable system. When it was put to use, we managed to reduce the number of symbols to 30.\nA different problem surfaced when the Ma’Apilim sought to integrate. To secure a good position you had to be able to communicate in Hebrew. Very few refugees were conversant. Initially, the issue was sorted out by finding them jobs that could be carried out without knowledge of the language of the Yishuv. In later years – after the foundation of Israel – the government introduced the Ulpanim, which conducted crush courses in Hebrew.\nDifficulties in communications often arose when new migrants were met upon their disembarkation on our shores. Usually, we had to enlist a trustworthy person conversant in one of the native languages of the Ma’Apilim. I soon discovered that quite a few of my classmates had a knowledge of Polish or Russian and that others were conversant in German. Occasionally, we had to find a Yiddish speaker, a difficult task because this Jargon was frowned upon by members of the Yishuv and only a handful would concede that they spoke or read it.\nI recall one particularly moving event, which took place when we escorted a group of Eastern European migrants. When we gathered that some of them came, originally, from Vilnius (in Poland) one of our girls asked if anybody had met her erstwhile Polish uncle. When it turned out that nobody had, our classmate sighed sadly, muttering that, in all probability, her uncle had been sent to the gas chambers.\nThe problem respecting languages was discussed in our Form’s gathering after school hours. All of us knew that Hebrew was revived as a spoken tongue around 1922. Many of our classmates were, actually, monolingual. Although they had a smattering command of English and, in some cases, of their parents’ original language, their internal monologue and their daily communications were conducted in Hebrew.\nSome of us, including Shosh and me, assumed that new arrivals would pick up Hebrew by osmosis. Disputing our theory, Reuben pointed out that by the time an individual was about six or seven years old, he (or she) lost the ability to learn a language by mingling with natives. He (or she) had to learn it as an extra language, just as we were taught English in school. Unexpectedly, Bushi sided with him, pointing out that although his own father was an accomplished linguist, he was unable to acquire an adequate command of Hebrew from clients and friends.\nAlthough the struggle for an independent Israel was in full swing, life in TA.1 continued as normal. By and large our teachers’ classes were non-political. All the same, the communal effort left its mark on our studies. Occasionally, some of us arrived late or were absent for a day or two. On many occasions our teachers, who appreciated what was going on, ignored the lapses.\nOur Form became increasingly cohesive. All of us had by then realised that nobody shone in all subjects. Thus, two of my classmates, including Reuben, were born scientists. Bushi, Shosh and I were good in the humanist subjects. Often the scientists stepped in when one us, the humanists, was unable to deal with a point raised by the teacher. The humanists, in turn, stepped in when one of our scientific colleagues was unable to deal with a point arising in Biblical Studies or in English Grammar.\nThe technique adopted by us was to create a diversion, which enabled a bewildered classmate to reflect or, worse still, glean the answer from a slip passed to him by one in the know. I recall how on one occasion Reuben was baffled when asked to explain a difficult verse in the Book of Hoshea. Quickly, Shosh created a diversion by stating that, in her opinion, the prophet Hoshea was vulgar. During the heated debate that followed, a chap called Ami sent a slip to Reuben, setting out an answer. The teacher nodded sagely as Reuben recited it but then turned to Ami and said: “Well done”.\nAlthough studies continued to progress on an even keel, our Form’s Committee recommended that we make a conscious effort to help newcomers to integrate. One of the new members of the Committee, Miriam, proposed that we invite migrants of our own age to our Kumsitzes. Her idea was adopted enthusiastically.\nBefore long, members of our Form – particularly Shosh – invited youngsters to join us and celebrate with us. We overcame the linguistic barrier by using Yiddish and, occasionally, by reverting to foreign languages so as to make our newcomers feel at home.\nThe influence was, actually, mutual. Many of our guests had much to offer. I recall that two girls were excellent dancers and taught us Mazurkas and other Eastern European folk dances. Another newcomer introduced us to Polish literature and yet another to some modern French authors.\nThis integration gained momentum when a club known as Ha’Boneh (the ‘builders’), most of whose members spoke German, opened its doors widely to us – the young generation. Quite a few members of our Form joined. In due course the younger members of the club arranged to change its name, first, to Ha’Magshim (‘the performer’) and later on to Yahad (togetherness). The club lasted. Although most members of the then-younger generation have aged, and others have emigrated or passed away, the ones still around continue to gather from time-to-time. The language used in its functions changed to Hebrew.\nDespite Bushi’s entreaties, I refused to join the club. Most of my time was taken up with my business activities and the national struggle. TA.1’s demanding curriculum, too, took up much of my time. The hours left to me were spent on my personal ambition (or dream) of laying the foundation for my future career on the stage.\nShosh and another girl, Miriam, helped me to improve my technique in acting. Both of them thought I was good at certain roles, such as Tevyeh and Falstaff, but performed poorly in other roles, such as Lennie in Mice and Men. Although I had the physique, I lacked the imagination and the required subtlety.\nThe two girls enlisted the aid of a fellow from another school, a chap called Gideon. The three of them made a concentrated effort but even after the lapse of three months my performance remained static. To my surprise, though, Gideon concluded that I had the skills of a performances-director and, in addition, thought I had the required administrative talent.\nHis words encouraged me to stage shows to be attended by pupils of TA.1. The first piece I chose was Chekhov’s Uncle Vania. It was performed just before the break following our first semester of my second year in TA.1. The audience enjoyed the performance but Shosh was not pleased with the way I acted the title role. She thought that I was unable to manifest the gloomy outlook on life displayed by Vania. Miriam and Gideon took a similar view but assured me that, all in all, it had been a success.\nFar from reading the writing on the wall, I staged Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar. Reuben played the role of Mark Antony. He was applauded but I knew that his heart was not in the show. Gideon played Cassius and Orna agreed to appear as Calpurnia. A fellow called Bertie, from the boys-only Form, appeared as Caesar and did well. I tried my hand at the role of Brutus. Once again, the show was well received but I knew that my performance was clumsy. Somehow, I was unable to assume the thought pattern of a reluctant assassin.\nTo my surprise this show led to a rebuke from our English Language Master, our dear Simple Simon. One day he confronted me in the corridor and expressed his chagrin at my having preferred Julius Caesar to Macbeth.\n“Chayim Rosenberg.” he bellowed. “Don’t tell me that you think Julius Caesar is the greater play? Your essays demonstrate you’re interested in Macbeth. You appreciated the drama when we covered it in class. So why the switch to that other play?”\n“But, Sir,” I replied uneasily, “can any one of our girls play Lady Macbeth? Don’t you think it is a difficult role, even for a professional actress?”\n“You have a point there,” he conceded.\n“Also, Sir, the staging presents a problem. Julius Caesar is easier to put on. And, Sir, what did you think of my Brutus?”\n“I can’t recall details,” Simple Simon prevaricated.\n“I saw how you watched me, Sir. Please let me have your assessment.”\nSimon’s face darkened. I sensed he was uneasy. Still, his critique mattered to me: I was determined to have it.\n“But look here, Chayim. We cannot expect a school’s performance to be on the same level as a play in an established theatre. You agree, don’t you?”\n“I do, Sir. But how well did I play Brutus? I worked hard on it. I really tried my best.”\n“But Brutus isn’t really your type of role. He is driven by dogma into the performance of an act atypical of him. He isn’t really an assassin and regrets the murderous act even as he performs it. He is a complex character. You, Chayim, are a straight thinker; and – I suspect – somewhat inflexible.”\n“What did you think of my role as Vania? You came to see our play.”\n“Same impression,” he told me after some lapse. “Vania is a pessimist. He is tired of life. You should avoid roles of that type. They aren’t for you.”\n“What sort of role would suit me?”\n“Falstaff,” he replied readily. “And you may immerse yourself in the personality of King Lear or Othello. Both of them are determined personalities. So are you. And look here, Chayim: very few actors can play virtually any type of role. Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh are the exception. So, please, don’t feel discouraged. There are many roles at which you would be very good. But, please tell me: do you contemplate a career on the stage?”\n“I do, Sir.”\n“Well, I wish you success. But please bear in mind that you have the makings of a teacher. Keep this as a second string to your bow.”\nI was impressed by Simon’s assessment. Years later I discovered that he was, actually, a well-known critic. Using a pseudonym, he regularly reviewed films and shows in a columns of a leading daily. Generally, he was caustic. I am told that, on one occasion, he made sarcastic remarks about a speech in an Italian film – La Strada – in which a clown opines that everything, including a pebble, has a function. Simon wrote that this point of view befitted a comedian. In a pungent reply, a reader opined that, as the learned reviewer was nothing but a mere grain of sand, his best course (if he had any) was to keep his views to himself. Simple Simon, so the rumour went on, was singularly irritable after this exchange of volleys.\nA distinct function I had to carry out regularly was a peacemaker’s. It stemmed from the fact that I was one of the tallest and strongest boys in our Form. When I was around, classmates preferred to settle differences by argument rather than by resorting to brute force. It was well known that I did not adopt the wisdom preached in the Bible (Prov. 26:17), which tells you that “[h]e who passes by, and meddles with a strife not his own, is like one who grabs a dog by his ears”. Preferring the approach of Job, who searched out the cause of quarrels coming to his attention (Job 29:17), I often stepped in when tempers were getting out of hand.\nI recall a particular instance in which a fellow we nicknamed Cactus drew a caricature of another fellow known as Bugi. Many of us enjoyed Cactus’ caricatures, especially when the subject was Sheen or Simple Simon. Bugi, alas, was inclined to laugh only at his own jokes. Enraged by Cactus’ rather explicit drawing, Bugi started to role up his sleeves. Unwilling to give way, Cactus rolled up his.\nMost of our classmates (regardless of sex) formed a circle of interested though impartial spectators of the anticipated punch-up. As Cactus and Bugi were generally friendly with one another, I decided to intervene. Separating the two would-be combatants, I demanded that each of them outline his grievance.\n“Cactus insulted me,” bellowed Bugi. “He drew me as a pompous ass.”\nSuppressing a sharp retort, Cactus mumbled that he had had no intention to offend. He pointed out that Bugi had laughed his head off when Cactus had displayed caricatures of our teachers.\n“An artist is entitled to some poetic licence,” interspersed Shosh, who had watched the proceedings keenly.\n“But am I that ridiculous?” growled Bugi, mollified but not fully appeased.\n“Of course not,” soothed Shosh. “But, then, is Sheen as fierce as Cactus draws him? We all laugh because Cactus picks up and overstates one of Sheen’s features.”\n“I think this settles it,” I saw fit to step in.\n“Come, let us go for a pita-falafel,” added Bushi. “I have some extra money this week. I’ll stand the four of you a treat.”\nAll faces brightened. We proceeded to the stall in the harmony prevailing amongst comrades. In tandem with Shosh’s renowned gluttony, Bushi treated her to an extra half portion of the beloved delicacy.\n5. Matriculation The State of Israel declared its independence on 15 May 1948. The ensuing months were marred by the war with our Arab neighbours. Fortunately, they were not united. The Syrian army, the Jordanian Arab Legion and the Egyptian troops fought us without any coordination or plan. We, in Tel Aviv, did not experience hardships. The places in which the war raged were the Galilee and Jerusalem. The latter was saved by an armistice, which enabled our engineering corps to build a new connecting road.\nThe fighters of the Yishuv did not need my support. I was too young to enlist in the Haganah. True, during the final years of the British mandate teenagers had a role to play. Our presence and aid in the smuggling of migrants was vital. Once Israel was established such services were no longer required.\nThe Independence War took about one year. The real struggle of the new State started when the fighting was over. Two lucrative outlets had been lost: the Arab market, which was also a major source of food supplies, and the British army. In consequence, many families lost their livelihood. Bushi’s father’s, for instance, had to shift his business to Italy where he had sound connections. Another classmate’s father had to close down his textile factory. He had been supplying Khaki cloth to the British forces (through the NAFI). The general public, too, faced hardships. Food and clothing had to be rationed. For a while, even toilet paper was in short supply.\nTo exacerbate the situation, the emerging State had to accommodate mass immigration. Migrants came from the devastated countries of Western Europe, from the hostile marshes of Eastern Europe, from North Africa and from Asia. Emigration, too, became common. Some of those who found it hard to cope migrated to the United States or returned to Europe.\nOur Form had its own casualty. Some two weeks after the outbreak of the Independence War, Ben Zvi announced that Reuben Klein had withdrawn from TA.1. His family ‘went down’ to St. Moritz (in Switzerland), where his uncle ran a successful hotel.\n“Shameful – so now we know Reuben’s true colours.” said his erstwhile pal, a boy called Abe.\n“And he didn’t even tell us – the coward,” said another member of the entourage.\n“So he was just all talk,” added a third.\nI was about to intervene, but Shosh stepped in first. Keen to support the underdog, she insisted we ought not to judge Reuben unless we were certain of the facts. At this stage, we did not know why he left or, indeed, why he kept mum about it. Insofar as she was concerned, Rueben remained unblemished unless she had sound grounds to condemn him. Hoping to stop the avalanche, I voiced my agreement. Reuben had discharged his duties as chairman of our Committee effectively and responsibly. We owed it to him – as well as to ourselves – not to pass sentence on him hastily and, in consequence, harshly.\n“But why did he not tell us?” asked Abe. “He had no reason to think his friends would turn a deaf ear; and he did have some very good and close friends here.”\nA quick glance, from the corner of my eye, revealed that Orna – Reuben’s girlfriend – kept her composure. Her calm and attractive face displayed no emotion. As often before, I felt a sense of admiration for her. Here was a girl who knew her mind and was capable of handling herself in any situation. She was not going to react. The ensuing silence was broken by Bushi.\n“Sir,” he addressed Ben Zvi, “Reuben did not talk to his friends because he was embarrassed. He felt too awkward. But he told me why he had to leave; and he had no choice. Any one of us would have done the same in the circumstances.”\n“But why did he talk to you and not to us?” Abe wanted to know.\n“Because we come from similar backgrounds; and he knew I’d understand. Also sometimes it’s easier to talk to somebody who’s not too close. You must know this.”\nAbe did not reply. Seeing my opportunity, I suggested we leave the subject and turn to the topic Ben Zvi had set for us. It was the Renaissance and – for the rest of the session – Ben Zvi, Bushi, Shosh and I had an interesting time. Still, Bushi’s attempt to canonise Machiavelli was not crowned with success.\nThe Foundation of Israel had an impact on my and David’s business enterprises. To start with, unemployment became widespread. Very few people could afford to pay for odd jobs. They had to learn how to use their own hands and brains. However, David’s income did not decrease substantially. The rampant inflation that took place during Israel’s early years enabled him to raise his charges. Naturally, when he was engaged, people bargained hard when he demanded his fee. His reply, to the effect that prices kept rising, usually struck a chord.\nTaxes, too, created a problem. During the days of the British Mandate, income tax was low and its collectors tended to be tardy. Rates rose sharply following Israel’s independence and the authorities became meticulous and strict. Even odd jobbers had to submit a yearly return. Unsurprisingly, this development had a domino effect. Still, the problem we faced was surmounted. Before long, charges depended on whether or not the employer demanded a receipt. As most jobs were carried out on the cash (non-receipt) market, our income tax was minimal. By and large, our income remained tax free.\nAnother problem resulted from the shortage of supplies. Officially you could get what you needed only against the tender of a prescribed price plus coupons. Many people, though, wanted to get extras. The ensuing black market thrived. If you wanted to get something for the official price, storekeepers often asserted the item was out of stock. They could arrange to supply it through black market channels. Double bookkeeping became common. David and I managed to get what we wanted on the ‘white market’ by arriving at the stores during the early hours of the morning and by stating, impudently, that supplies ought ‘now’ to be available.\nThe co-existence of the black market and rationing (‘Zena’ in the vernacular) became a common joke. I recall that at the Purim Party (the Israeli masquerade evening gathering) Bushi and I portrayed the economic reality. Being a tall and heavyset adolescent, I assumed the role of the black market. Two toilet paper rolls decorated my arms, vacant cans of rare delicacies (such as lobster) hung from my chest and back and two empty bottles of Cognac protruded from my elegant hat. Bushi, who was a lean and sickly looking boy, had fake Zena coupons sewn to his shirt, old newspapers covered his arms and a bare yarmulke covered his head. Everybody – including Ben Zvi – roared with laughter. Shosh, who led the procession, pushed a pita-falafel stall on wheels. Our object was to tell our friends that some basic treats remained available without rationing.\nI am proud to tell that, despite the turmoil prevailing in Israel, our studies continued in even keel. I recall that our teachers stuck to the syllabus and avoided any comparison with the daily developments in Israel. One of Ben Zvi’s remarks provides a prime example. When we covered the outbreak of the French Revolution and Napoleon’s rise to power, Abe (Reuben’s erstwhile friend) suggested we compare that historical process with Israel’s struggle for independence. Ben Zvi refused to hear of it. Pointing out that the French Revolution took place at the end of the 18th century, he emphasised the difference between the Feudal system of those days and the conditions prevailing in our own time. He suggested that any comparative analysis ought to be discussed in private.\nAnother event I recall occurred in one of Old Frank’s classes of Biblical Studies. One of our orthodox classmates, Arieh, insisted that some of the events told by Daniel materialised in our own period.\n“My object is to study the text,” replied Frank. “Speculations on the materialisation of prophecies are out of bounds.”\nWhen I reflect on these incidents and on the policy adopted by our teachers, I find myself in support. Perhaps our biology teacher, Ms Garten, put it most neatly. One of our girls argued that, as a matter of evolution, the erection of a Third Holy Temple was on the cards.\n“Evolution deals with the development of the species and of organs, such as the eye or the brain. The Erection of a Third Temple is a policy issue, best discussed in the Political Science courses of a university.”\nAll in all, the creation of Israel meant that the time I used to spend on the independence struggle was now available for other pursuits. Shosh, who had my interests at heart, encouraged me to get ready for a career on the stage. She maintained that one avenue was the staging of a drama at the conclusion of each of TA.1’s semesters. Bushi, too, encouraged me. Their words fell on listening ears.\nThe main obstacle I faced was the spotting of suitable plays. Obviously, they had to be short and have a limited ensemble. Plays which involved too many roles or which required the participation of a ballet group or of a substantial choir were too hard for us. Further, the staging had to be simple. Fancy castles or roomy houses had to be avoided. So did plays which required a sea or river scene. One additional point of substance was the nature of the ‘roles’. Any play had to be ruled out if it included a role (or character) which nobody would be able to perform. For instance, Medea had to be excluded for that very reason.\nAnother issue related to finances. Putting up a play involved expenses and, in addition, the ensemble had to find a venue for rehearsals. Sheen alone could sanction these. Some financial assistance was obtainable from the newly established Council of the Arts. The application, though, had to be signed by Sheen. He was also in charge of the allocation of premises for rehearsals.\nTo my delight, Sheen was supportive. However, he wanted to have a say in the choice of pieces to be performed by us. He vetoed my initial selection, namely of Eugene O’Neal’s Mourning Becomes Electra. His main ground was that the play was difficult to stage and that it was too long. He then asked, pointedly, why I did not prefer the Greek drama, Aeschylus’ The Orestea, which the American playwright had utilised. Finally, he added that a play based on fate or on pseudo-psychoanalysis was not suitable for a school performance.\n“In any event,” he added, “I agree with Charlie Chaplin: O’Neil was hollow.”\nWe went through a list of modern Russian plays based on bravery. Sheen sneered. He thought that militarism was injected into our classes at school. It need not dominate our artistic assessment of a work.\n“Mr. Simon wants to stage one of Shakespeare’s plays.”\n“I understand,” muttered Sheen, “but, then, you have already performed Julius Caesar. There are many other famous playwrights.”\nIn the end, we settled on Schiller’s Wilhelm Tell, which dealt with the 14th century rebellion of the Swiss people against the Habsburg Empire. Staging was easy and there were only three principal characters: the leader of the revolt – the marksman Tell (who was able to hit a target with his crossbow from a distance of 100 yards); the tyrannical governor – Gessler; and the latter’s ward, a girl named Bertha, who was sympathetic to the rebels’ cause. The drama ended with the oppressors’ defeat.\n“So you see, Chayim, although the play was written in 1804 it has remained topical,” grinned Sheen. “Also, it was translated to Hebrew by Bialik, one of our national poets. This fact will carry weight with the authorities when I apply for a grant.”\n“Would that really be the play of your choice,” I asked because I noted that Sheen’s response did not display enthusiasm.\n“Not really, Chayim. My choice would be Euripides’ Iphigenia in Aulis, in which the father, Agamemnon, sacrifices his daughter so as to appease the Pagan Gods. But I don’t think we have a Hebrew translation and, in any event, it may be too difficult for a school’s performance.”\nIn due course, we staged Wilhelm Tell. Sheen invited an acquaintance, who contributed a column on ‘Culture in Israel’ to a well-known daily. To my delight our show was mentioned, principally as a manifestation of the young generation’s ability to find parallels in European history to our national struggle. In addition, he praised my performance as Gessler, the tyrant. I felt that I was beginning to climb the ladder to a future on one of our theatres.\nLife in TA.1 continued harmoniously. Our Kumsitzes were well-attended and cemented the closeness that prevailed in our Form. Some two weeks before the end of term, we started our cramming sessions. Bushi’s house became a meeting place for many of us. I recall how, on one occasion, Bushi maintained that Advanced Mathematics and Hebrew Grammar had one point in common: both were void of any sense. Abe – who used to be close to Reuben – countered that Advanced Mathematics was geared in pure reason.\n“Oh well,” Bushi gave way. “If that is so, the common ground of the two subjects is that they have been invented for the sole purpose of torturing the innocent.”\n“You mean: the uninterested onlookers,” retorted Abe, who relished all science courses but abhorred the humanities. Still, such broadsides did not affect our cooperation. Bushi continued to teach Grammar whilst Abe gave him extra tuition in Calculus. I, too, played an important role, mainly when it came to cramming Arabic.\nDuring that very period, I (or rather Mother) became the owner of a business. I have to mention that in those remote days there were no supermarkets and, as far as I can recall, no department stores. Most streets in Tel Aviv housed grocers, greengrocers, butchers and fishmongers. There were also some specialised delicatessen stores. Naturally, most people went to shops in their neighbourhood. By and large, shop owners had an excellent business.\nWhen I discovered that the grocer in our street, Mr. Asher, wanted to withdraw from his business, I offered to purchase it. After some hard bargaining we agreed on a price and payment terms. As David and I were still minors, the contract had to be executed by Mother. Further, we anticipated that Mother would run the business and, in this way, find a suitable occupation.\nFeeling at ease after the execution of the transaction, I remarked jokingly that Mr. Asher ought to be able to retire comfortably on the fortune he made.\n“That’s not my reason for giving up such a fine shop.” He then rolled up his trousers and asked me to have a look at his legs. I was dismayed to see that his veins were protruding and sore.\n“I am sorry, Mr. Asher. How did you get these?”\n“In this business you have to be on your feet all the time. This is tough if you have symptoms of varicose veins.”\n“I only hope Mother will not succumb,” I muttered.\n“If she develops any symptoms she simply must resell the business. I made the mistake of waiting too long.”\n“Is there a cure?” I wanted to know.\n“At this time, the only treatment is an operation. The best surgeons are in England; so my doctor contacted a friend in London. I am flying over next week. And you know, they have just introduced a healthcare system. If I establish temporary residence, the treatment is free.\nMother ran the shop effectively and, I am glad to say, did not develop varicose veins. The business was, however, affected when supermarkets arrived in Tel Aviv. Mother sold the shop at a modest profit and retired on her meagre savings. David and I helped her to maintain a comfortable standard of living.\nIn a sense, though, I am jumping the gun. At about the time we bought the grocery, David was in his last year of primary school. His grades would not have enabled him to apply successfully for a place in TA.1 but quite a number of less prestigious secondary schools would have been ready to take him in. David, though, was not interested.\n“You know, Chayim,” he explained himself, “I am not attracted to further studies. I want to go to a business or professional school and, when I am ready, to launch my own enterprise. You know that I am good at odd jobbing. If I had a business of my own, I should know how to run it.”\nHis words made sense. In the event, I saw him through a fine professional school and was pleased when, during a vacation in his second year of studies, he joined the local office of a foreign bank as a cadet. Later in life, David was employed by the same bank and, in due course, rose high in the business world. I am satisfied that he had made the correct decision. Although we had our differences later in life, I believe that in these early days his heart was in the right place.\nI was now close to graduating from TA.1. Military service had by then been introduced and I knew I would have to spend about two years in the army. A basic training course was compulsory but I was keen to be moved, after completing it, to the Entertainment Corps. This encouraged me to stage more dramas during my remaining years in our school.\nRegrettably, I was unable to put up Tevye the Milkman. None of our fair colleagues was keen to act the role of his wife. It would also have been difficult to persuade one of them to play the matchmaker. In the event, Bushi induced me to put up the show in Yahad. Naturally, I played Tevyeh and we had no difficulty in finding takers for the feminine roles. The staging presented some problems but two members of Yahad helped me overcome them. The play involves a pogrom and, instead of actually staging it, we displayed the fear and revulsion of the persecuted when they heard the approaching Cossacks. Another trick concerned the scene in which Tevyeh accompanied his daughter, who was leaving home in order to join her fiancé who had been exiled to Siberia. We showed the sad parting scene by placing father and daughter on a bench in front of the door to the imaginary platform.\nThe show was attended not only by the young members of the Club but also by the older generation. The applause confirmed that the event had been a success. I recalled, affectionately, my discussion of the play with Mrs. Kornmehl. I also knew – with certainty – that Tavyeh was a role that suited me and my temperament.\nA few months later, I staged a drama in TA.1. Once again we found it difficult to select an appropriate play. Chekhov’s The Cherry Orchard had to be ruled out because we had already performed his Uncle Vania. Ibsen’s Peer Gynt was considered too ambitious and his The Enemy of the People was being performed by a well known theatre.\nIn the end we settled on Bertolt Brecht’s The Good Soul [Woman] of Szechwan. Initially, I feared that Sheen would refuse to apply for funds to be used for the staging of a German play. My apprehension, though, was unwarranted. Sheen approved of our choice.\n“Brecht was, of course, a German. But he hated the Nazis and was prominent on their hit list. He was a great playwright and The Good Soul is outstanding.”\nI was of the same opinion. Brecht’s masterpiece deals with the paradox of goodness in an evil world. The principal character of the play is the prostitute, Shen Teh, who is the only person in the town to give shelter to three gods masquerading as travellers. They are disappointed with the greed, dishonesty and selfishness they have discerned in modern society. Moved by Shen Teh’s goodness they enable her to buy a tobacco shop. However, Shen Teh’s inability to decline the demands made on her modest business and her impulse to ‘do good’ soon led to her shop becoming an unruly poor- house, which attracts crime and requires police supervision. Her ‘goodness’ leads to ‘evil’. The chorus opines that hers is not the way to solve the ills of this world.\nTo solve her problem Shen Teh dons male clothes and a mask, and assumes the role of a fictitious male cousin, Shui Ta, who is put in charge of the shop. Shui Ta is an unfeeling entrepreneur, who soon turns the small shop into a successful enterprise. Where Shen Teh would be driven by her emotion to do good, her alter ego is a ruthless, worldly businessmen.\nMatters come to a head when the real Shen Teh falls in love with a scoundrel who sets out to exploit her. When she breaks down and cries bitterly, an employee enters the room. As he finds only Shui Ta (the alter ego) he suspects that Shen Teh was murdered by her cousin. The case is prosecuted before the ‘gods’, now turned judges. Contextually, it is clear that Shen Teh is not tried on the murder charge. The issue before the ‘judges’ is whether, all in all, Shen Teh has established that she is good. In the event, the narrator throws the task of coming up with a verdict on the audience. The real issue raised by Brecht is whether a good (or decent) person can retain his (or her) outlook in a flawed world.\nThe play had been translated into Hebrew by a well-known man of letters, who departed from Germany in 1933. As our language had developed over the years, our team made a few amendments to the text so as to bring the dialogues up to date. I then had to find somebody who could play the role of Shen Teh cum Shui Ta. I was too heavyset for it and none of our classmates wanted to take it on. In the event, a girl from another Form, who (like me) aspired for a career in the theatre, volunteered. She knew it was a difficult role but wanted to prove her ability.\nMy own role in the performance was confined to directing and to a minor role: the scoundrel who breaks Shen Teh’s heart. Sheen, who attended our dress rehearsal, was so impressed that he gave all Forms a morning off so that everybody could attend the show. He also suggested that a chorus ought to replace the role of the narrator. We adopted the course proposed by him.\nThe show was a success. Each member of the cast and all advisers and assistants were given the privilege of inviting two friends. Most of them invited their parents. Shosh, though, invited but one guest: a young businessman, Uzi Shamir, with whom she was going steady. It dawned on me that my relationship with Shosh was bound to remain platonic. Bushi, whose parents had never mastered Hebrew, invited two of his friends in Yahad. To my delight, the Club’s Committee was so impressed by the praise heaped by Bushi’s guests that they invited us to perform the show on their own premises. I was glad to oblige and to have yet a further success.\nBen Zvi, too, was pleased, especially because the initiative for the performance came from his Form. In his own way, he regarded our success as evidence of the efficacy of his pedagogical approach. Obviously, he reflected a great deal on Brecht’s drama. A few days after the school performance, he cornered me in the corridor.\n“Chayim,” he asked, “why do you think Brecht placed the action in China. He had never set a foot in China and knew little about Szechwan.”\n“I am not sure, Sir.”\n“Well, whom does Brecht attack in his play? As you ought to know, Brecht was a socialist. After the end of WWII he settled in East Berlin. In all his writings, he is critical of the milieu of the social order of Europe – the very society in which he grew up.”\n“Is it possible that he wanted to distance his parody from Europe?” I asked.\n“That too. But is it also possible that he wanted to tell us that the evil of capitalism applied right across the board?”\n“That point was raised by Shosh. Bushi raised another point. He asked why Brecht made his heroine a prostitute. After all, any naïve woman could do.”\n“Did he answer his own question?”\n“He thought that Brecht wanted to tell us that in a bourgeois society, the only honest person is a prostitute.”\n“A perceptive observation. I, too, came to this conclusion.”\nMany years have passed since this seminal performance. I have watched the drama in Paris, in Munich and actually put it up in New York where I settled for a few years. Still, I am convinced that our show in TA.1 was the best. Somehow, every member of the cast put his (or her) heart into the performance. The final product was great.\nMy remaining years in TA.1 were an anti-climax. All of us had to cram hard and, in addition, had to take Sheen’s tongue lashes when he dissected our essays. Ben Zvi, who conducted the classes in History and in Geography, was another hard taskmaster. Ms Garten, too, did not suffer fools lightly. Simple Simon and Klein (the Mathematics Master) were somewhat less demanding but, on occasions, let their irritation show when one of us was unable to handle an issue referred to him (or her). Actually, I am satisfied that the standard of teaching in TA.1 was unique. It far exceeded the yardsticks prevailing in universities and seminars I have since attended. I believe that graduating from TA.1 with high grades was a benchmark.\nDavid, too, enjoyed his courses. I am satisfied that his studies in the school he attended prepared him for his future career as a model banker. I doubt if university training would have been of any benefit to him. As we progressed in our respective studies, I became convinced that David would grow into a handsome and reliable young man. I was proud of him.\nDuring our last year in TA.1, every boy had to undergo a medical test. Bushi alone was declared ‘permanently excluded (from army service) for reasons of health’. The rest of us passed and then had an interview with the Mustering Committee appointed by the military’s authorities. We were given the chance to express our desires respecting the type of army body in which we wanted to be enlisted once we passed a basic course. Naturally, I indicated a strong preference for service in the Entertainment Corps. The committee took notes and one of its members cross examined me about my contributions to artistic pursuits during my school days. I felt I had left a positive impression.\nThe last event I wish to relate is our farewell party. All of us were accompanied by parents and siblings. Sheen gave a moving speech expressing his satisfaction with our batch. He added that he expected many of us to leave our mark in the subjects we chose.\nI was invited to read out a poem about ‘School Day Friendship’ written by one of Israel’s young poets. It struck a chord. When I think about this last function of our schooling days, I feel warmth and satisfaction. Somehow the words of the poet have materialized. I have remained close to Bushi and Shosh. Bushi, in turn, maintained life long friendships with many of our classmates. I gather that he, too, switched to English, and adopted it as his main language. However, he continued to correspond with his Israeli friends in Hebrew. I have also remained in touch with Reuben, whom I visited on some occasions during my years in New York. He settled in the United States, although in another place.\n6. En route A few weeks after graduating from TA.1 I enlisted in the army. Like all recruits I had to spend some two months in the basic training corps. My recollections of this period are mixed. On the positive side, the trainers (Madrichim) subjected all of us to a rigorous regime. We had to march, climb fences and jump from high surfaces wearing all our equipment. We were taught how to tackle the enemy if we had to resort to hand-to-hand combat. Further, the system sought to instil in us the impulse of obeying orders unquestionably. Regrettably, the trainers were brutish. Some recruits were beaten up for no reason at all. I could see the importance of the training but had my doubts about the methods. In my eyes this negative aspect of the course outweighed its usefulness.\nI recall one typical event. We were instructed that if a person had an abdominal injury, you should refuse to give him any liquid. One of us – a future physician with a high grade in biology – asked innocently why that was so. For a few moments the trainer reflected. Then he came up with a strange pearl of wisdom:\n“Well, if you give him water it would run out of the hole.” He then added fiercely: “The instruction is clear. So you must do so. In the army, you have to obey your superiors and their orders. You are not in a dandy high school, you ass!”\nI found this approach objectionable and counter productive. It militated against the Socratic teaching method I was used to. It dawned on me that in the army a soldier’s rank outweighed his wisdom and integrity. I was – still am – aware that an individual’s thoughts had to give way to the orders given to him. I was, at the same time, conscious of the fact that very often a soldier paid with his life for his superiors’ blunders. Vividly, I recalled Ben Zvi’s discussion of the Napoleonic wars and of their cost to life, especially the horrors of the Battle of Borodino. All in all, I regarded the training course and the doctrines imparted to us unavoidable evils.\nWhen the course was over, I was invited to join the Entertainment Corps. My work there was, I regret to say, a questionable experience. All shows and programmes we performed sought to idealise a soldier’s courage and his ‘duty to obey’. I recall in particular one drama which was based on a book published by a middling author. It told the story of the heroism of the red army and the merciless punishment meted out to dissenters. Technically, our theatrical output was acceptable. But was it entertaining?\nIn addition, we had programmes concerning the Holocaust. The one dealing with the bravery of the resistance in Ghetto Warsaw was melodramatic and, I fear, unconvincing. The few survivors were those who had the resolution and cunning needed for an escape. Many of our viewers sympathized with them rather than with the perished heroes.\nOne play that irked me in particular was based on a Russian book in which the hero saves his troupe but, in doing so, disregards his superior’s instructions. He is awarded a medal for heroism but is executed for insurrection. The book and the play, which I thought unimaginative, were based on a well-known French book. The latter made its point. Our author failed to do so. I suspect the audience cheered the hero and condemned his stupid superior. Still, memoranda from above demanded that we stage this indifferent – and to my mind misguided – play. To the best of my knowledge, it has never been performed since.\nAnother stupid play concerned a pilot, whose legs had to be amputated after an accident. Persistent drive and effort enabled him to regain his pilot’s post despite this mutilation. The object of the play was to praise courage and determination. Personally, I concluded that, quite regardless of an invalid’s valour, I should avoid taking a flight in charge of a handicapped pilot. I suspect the audience was of the same view.\nAfter some three months in the Corps, I approached our Head, Bennie Ornan, who was a career soldier, with a suggestion that we perform Wilhelm Tell. I told him about our success with the play in TA.1 and assured him it was easy to stage. Bennie rejected my idea outright. In his opinion, a 14th century rebellion was not in point.\n“My daughter attended your show. I know it was a success. And I know that you are good at directing and staging. She told me all about the props. But look here: our object is not just to entertain but also to indoctrinate.”\n“Propaganda?” I asked.\n“You can call it that. I know that Wilhelm Tell was written by Schiller and that it is a good – although perhaps not an outstanding – play. But the message it conveys differs from the objectives prescribed to us.”\nI watched Bennie thoughtfully. He was a middle-aged man who had started life as a journalist. He then devoted himself to the Haganah and after Israel was founded joined the ranks of the regular army. I knew he was interested in the arts and that he was well-read. His reaction seemed out of character and inconsistent with his sophisticated and cultured outlook.\nNoting my crestfallen ambience and patent disappointment, Bennie explained: “Look here, Chayim. Our aim is not confined to entertainment. In this regard, we differ from a regular theatre. We have to convey a topical message. Your main point of reference is art; ours is propaganda.”\n“I’ll have to adjust to this,” I conceded with a sigh.\n“I have a better idea. I have noted how you take instant decisions when you deal with the props or stage a show. Also, I believe you are by nature a leader. You usually find the best way out of a dilemma. I suggest you transfer to the Officers Training Course and return to us when you complete it. It is the best I can do for you.”\nI am glad that I followed Bennie’s advice. The Course was excellent. It emphasised three points. First, we were taught how to make instant decisions. In a sense, this aspect of the programme reinforced my natural inclination to make my mind up promptly. My past as an odd jobs boy stood me in good stead. I recalled how my brother, David, and I had to act swiftly when pipes burst or were blocked.\nThe second point of emphasis was to teach us how to act as a leader. Here I learnt a great deal. In a sense, though, the training brought to the surface qualities which I had had all my life but which remained dormant. The high intelligent quotients of my classmates in TA.1 made it easy to direct them. The Officers Training Course showed me how to lead a group of dunces. You had to stand on your authority both in peaceful and in turbulent times. You could be benevolent to your subordinates but, at the same time, had to keep your distance. Some of my work for the Haganah as a teenager formed a basis. But I had much to learn and, I am glad to say, did so.\nThe third principle, which was novel, was the importance of sparing your men. In seeking to achieve your object it was necessary to abstain from any action that shed their blood wantonly. In a sense, you had to draw a balance. In some situations you had to hold on to the very end. In others, you had to surrender or withdraw in time.\nWe covered in detail some famous battles. I was appalled by the Napoleonic tactics, which prescribed a victory regardless of the loss of life amongst Bonaparte’s own troops. The battle of Waterloo appeared an unsavoury apex, including Marshall Nay’s senseless cavalry attack which led to the slaughter of his own horsemen by Wellington’s well-trained infantry. Another battle we studied in detail was Stalingrad, where the Nazis tried to hold on to a defeated position. All in all, I concluded that a good officer sought to spare his men. He might on occasion be forced to sacrifice some of them. At the same time, he had to recall that life was precious.\n“Sir,” I asked the trainer so as to get a clear answer, “sometimes a General has to send an entire detachment on a hopeless mission. In reality, he sacrifices them. How does he justify this to himself? Or is he trained not to care?”\n“A good General makes such a sacrifice only when it is dictated by necessity. If he does not care about his men, he is a poor soldier. This is particularly so in the case of our army. A fallen trooper is not always replaceable. Our resources are limited. Adolf Hitler’s refusal to endorse the surrender of his Sixth Army in Stalingrad was stupid. Field Marshall Paulus acted in good faith when he disobeyed his Führer’s senseless command and capitulated.”\n“So on occasion a good officer must disobey his superior’s order?”\n“Only in rare cases. If he does, he must be able to justify his act to a court martial.\nThere was such an instance in WWI when, enraged by his troops’ refusal to storm out of trenches that were under fire, a French General ordered his own canons to target them. The officer-in-charge demanded a written instruction. To my mind, he should have refused outright: the order was outrageous.”\n“But on some occasions you cannot reach a conclusion until the event is over. What do you in such a case?”\n“Rely on your instincts. If in doubt, obey the order.” For a few moments the trainer reflected. The issue was a difficult one. He then added: “This Course’s object is to teach you how to keep a cool and detached head. If you are a good officer, you come up with an appropriate decision before the skirmish is over. In a sense, the difference between a good officer and a poor one relates to this very point. A good officer makes his decisions whilst the battle is on and sticks to them.”\n“Isn’t this really a question of temperament and character?”\n“It is. And so some trainees will fail this Course. Our object is to identify the ones suitable for the job.”\n“Occasionally, though, you have to hold on even if the odds are against you. I am thinking about the last stand of the defenders of Masada. They faced the Romans for three long years. When the last fortification fell, they committed communal suicide. They were not prepared to surrender,” I told the trainer.\n“Those were exceptional circumstances. Occasionally, a defeated army has to surrender. Do you agree?”\n“Actually, I do. I should hate to see my men butchered once we are defeated.”\n“And who is to decide that all hope is gone?”\n“The officer-in-charge,” I replied after a momentary hesitation.\n“Good answer,” he confirmed.\nWe had two useful sessions about the importance of surprise tactics. In the course of them we also appreciated the role of intelligence services. The trainer started the first session by asking us to mention surprise attacks narrated in the Old Testament. One of us referred to the battle launched by Chieftain Gideon (Judges 7:15-22). He attacked the invaders’ camp at midnight with but three hundred men, who tooted horns and uttered alarming noises. In the ensuing confusion the invaders fled in ignominy.\nI then referred to the battle of the Ai (Joshua 8:3-20), in which Joshua’s army stationed an ambush behind the town, whilst a decoy lured the enemy’s forces away. Nodding his head, the trainer observed that such tactics, of luring the enemy into an ambush, were used by the Mongols. He then pointed out that the ambush was, in itself, a surprise. So was the planting of a decoy, such as Montgomery’s trick of planting an armoured car on the muddy terrain with the object of misleading Rommel. The latter concluded – as hoped by Monty – that the terrain was manageable and was dismayed when his armoured vehicles progressed very slowly over the treacherous ground.\n“But, Sir, what would happen if the enemy got wind of the trap?” asked one of us.\n“Then the army that set it would be caught off guard. And this leads us to the next point: an efficient intelligence system – a functional spy ring – can often determine the outcome of a battle. Some Russian campaigns of WWII were affected by the breaking of codified German messages.”\nAnother session dealt with the importance of communiqués. In some cases their object was to mislead the enemy. The trainer discussed in details the misleading press and other tactics used in order to convince the Axis (Nazis) that the Allies would land in Normandy whilst the operation was actually to take place in Sicily. He then turned to the other objectives of the media, which was to boost the soldiers’ morale. Monty’s first effort, after he assumed the command of the Eighth Army, was to destroy his men’s belief in Rommel’s invincibility. His object was to enable them to regain their buoyancy.\n“Sir,” one of us queried, “is a battle just an upmarket version of the chess game?”\n“In many ways it is. However, a pawn in a chess game has no soul or life of its own. In contrast, the troopers, the ‘pawns’ in a battle, are human beings whose lives are dear and whose self-confidence may affect a battle. A good officer knows that every man under his command has a survival instinct. Once a soldier’s confidence and trust are gone, his main object is to save himself.”\n“I thought that commanding officers played war games,” I pointed out.\n“They do. Further, they assume that soldiers are of a uniform ability and standard. Actually, this is dangerous: generals occasionally overlook the difference between the pieces in a war game and the activities that take place in the front. A good commander knows which of his troops are reliable and fit.”\nWe had some interesting sessions concerning the formation of battle lines, respecting cover and camouflage and another session teaching us how to lead soldiers in frontal attacks. The remaining sessions dealt with issues of deportment and with the need to gain both the respect and the devotion of subalterns. Generally, the Israeli army is known for its cohesion and esprit de corps. Officers had to be taught how to retain their aura of command without being guilty of vanity and pomp.\nAll in all, I believe the Officers Training Course had a positive effect on all trainees. I was pleased when, after its completion, our superior told me that I passed. He did, at the same time, indicate that my chances of rising through the ranks were dubious. I had not demonstrated capacity as a tactician. Further, he doubted my ability to sacrifice troopers caught in a trap.\n“You are more concerned with your men’s safety than with the outcome of a battle. In a sense, you are too scrupulous.”\n“I believe I am. You see, Sir, I hate the idea of loss of life. Perhaps I am too squeamish. I simply do not wish to be responsible for the letter of condolence received by the dead soldier’s next of kin.”\nAfter the course was completed, we had a sumptuous party. My two guests were Shosh and Bushi (Eli). I believe all present enjoyed themselves. Bushi alone appeared thoughtful and, in a sense, dejected.\n“So we are becoming a war faring nation,” he muttered.\n“We were so since the very beginning of our history. The feats of Joshua are discussed at length in the book named after him.”\n“I know,” mused Bushi, “but for generations we were known as Am Ha’Sefer (the Nation of the Book).”\n“Surely, we can be successful on both fronts,” asserted Shosh. “Think about the rebuilding of the destroyed fortifications of Jerusalem. Nehemiah tells us that that those who built the wall “loaded themselves in such a way that with one of his hands each laboured in the work, and with the other hand he held a weapon” (Nehem. 4:11).1\n“Let us hope that our generation recalls that our main ‘labour’ relates to the widening of our intellectual horizons,” replied Bushi.\nFollowing my completion of the Officers Training Course, I returned to the Entertainment Corps. Bennie Ornan welcomed me back. To my delight he told me that his superiors had approved the staging of Tevyeh the Milkman.\n“I convinced them that Tevyeh’s heroism and firm stand are topical,” he advised me. “They realised that the strength of character of a Diaspora Jew and his willingness to stand his ground in adversity provided a model of good conduct. So was his leniency when his first two daughters refused to comply with the old fashioned system of marriage with the aid of a matchmaker and followed the commands of their respective hearts. His rejection of his third daughter, who married out, was also in character. She had overstepped the thin line defining his liberalism. Here, too, he stood his ground.”\n“I’ll make sure the performance is in harmony with the commands of our propaganda directive.”\n“Good man, my fellow officer.”\nThe show was a hit. We performed it in many camps as well under the auspices of a number of minor theatres. My own achievement, in playing Tevyeh, attracted a number of positive press reviews. I followed this success by staging a number of propaganda shows. Bennie Ornan was pleased.\nMy service was drawing to its end. Bennie assured me that he would support my application for a job in the regular army. A sound income and pension would be secured. Further, he was convinced that I was in a position to contribute and even raise the Corps’ standards. At the same time, he pointed out that, if I opted for this route, a rise to stardom in a major theatre would necessarily be ruled out.\nI was of two minds. I could contribute to the development of the Entertainment Corps even if I chose to leave the army after my compulsory two years of service. A soldier who returned to civil life remained in the army with one foot: he became a member of the militia (‘reservists’). Until a specified age, he would have to spend about one month per year in ‘militia service’ and would be obliged to return to his unit if the authorities proclaimed a general mobilisation, for instance, when a war broke out. Bennie had indicated that he would support my application to carry out my ordinary militia service in his Corps.\nFor a while, I remained undetermined. Then, by sheer chance, I ran into Sheen. He was walking home after school hours and appeared carefree. His advice was clear:\n“Look here, Mr. Rosenberg …\n“Rosenne… Dr. Katz,” I corrected him. “I changed my surname after joining the army.”\n“Well, Chayim Rosenne,” he grinned, “you have not finished your course of studies. A university degree would stand you in good stead later in life. If you are entitled to a scholarship, enrol in the Hebrew University.”\nI took Sheen’s advice and started reading for a B.A. During my first two years in Jerusalem, I saw a great deal of Bushi, who was finishing his legal studies and was also engaged as a cadet in a well-known law firm. Shosh came over from time to time and I recall one occasion when the three of us met and talked with nostalgia about our years in TA.1. From an observation, I gathered that Shosh’s marriage was turbulent. I felt sympathy but sensed she had no wish to unburden herself.\nBy and large, my years in the Hebrew University were pleasing. The courses were satisfactory, though not brilliant. I distinguished myself in Hebrew Literature and Talmud but fear that I did not shine. Still, before long, we developed a social circle. In the parties thrown by us, I met a number of girls with a liberal outlook and had a good time.\nThen thunder struck. One morning my chest was excruciating. When the symptom persisted, I dragged myself to the nearest public hospital. To my dismay, the physician in charge of emergency diagnosed a heart attack, involving the blockage of an artery, and rushed me to the Cardiac Division. The medical treatment available in those days was conservative. All in all, I was instructed to rest and remained bed ridden for two weeks. The first week was revolting. I was not allowed to go the bathroom, was washed (or rather ‘dubbed’) by nurses and had to submit to their brushing my teeth. Further, during this depressing week I was not expected to turn in bed and, to avoid any bruising, had to lie on a rubber tyre placed on my mattress.\nShosh rushed up on the very day I was hospitalised. Bushi came the next day. I recall how I muttered that I hated to see my motion carried. His reply was succinct:\n“So, in the very least, you do not lose out in the debates. And look here, Pilkin, I am sure you’ll be back to normal in no time. Let’s make some plans for the period following your graduation.”\n“I want to see the world, Bushi. How about a trip to Europe?”\n“As soon as you are up to it. And look, Pilkin, such a trip costs money. We’ll have to save hard.”\n“Hear, hear,” I replied. “Let us plan it when I’m again mobile.”\nBushi had to return to his post in the law firm in Tel Aviv but David came over on the very same day. He had been granted two weeks of compassionate leave by the army and stationed himself in my room in Jerusalem. He visited me daily, smuggled in pita-falafel portions (which I devoured in sheer disregard of the physicians’ orders) and he spent hours by my bedside. After three weeks the hospital discharged me. Still, I was warned not to overstrain myself and, in general, to take things easy. In particular, the Head of the Cardiac Division warned me against climbing stairs.\nThis admonition presented a problem. Our residence in Tel Aviv was a walk-up apartment, located on the top floor. I had to be carried upstairs and then started to take a few stairs each day. It took me some two months to recover in full. Fortunately, I had worked hard on my courses prior to my illness and, in addition, got the lecture notes of a colleague. At the end of the semester I was in a position to sit for my B.A. examinations. As anticipated, I secured sound grades.\nI felt I was ready for a trip to Europe. Bushi and I planned it carefully. Our funds were limited but we concluded that we could make ends meet. Shosh, who was pregnant, could not join us.\nIt was a magnificent tour. We visited quite a number of European countries. I noted that Bushi, who was an odd man out by nature, found it easier than me to find his way abroad. He was also in a better frame of mind than back in Israel.\nOne day I might write a short story or a play about our tour. In the context of this autobiography I confine myself to a number of interesting events. The first took place in Izmir, where our ship stopped on its way to Istanbul. Having joined two other youngish tourists, we managed to hire a taxi with the object of visiting the famed mountain peak. On the way back, the driver proceeded down the slope in a convoluted manner. Bushi, who conversed with the driver in German, looked dismayed when the latter explained that the brakes did not function. Bushi did not convey the message to us but my command of Yiddish enabled me to comprehend. I breathed with the relief when we dismounted by the pier.\nThe next experience took place in Istanbul, which turned out to be far more expensive than we had anticipated. When we ran out of funds, Bushi secured the post of a guide showing the sites of the magnificent city to German speaking tourists. I noted with glee that, in the process, he became very friendly with a Viennese tourist, a girl called Adele.\nTowards the end of our stay in the erstwhile Byzantine metropolis, Bushi suggested that we visit the red-light district, where prostitutes displayed themselves in a window of their premises. Our plan was to take separate routes once we arrived at the gateway to our destination. However, knowing that Bushi was naïve and likely to be taken advantage of, I followed him until he entered the premises of a motherly-looking middle-aged woman. I then went to the nearby premises of a youngish looking tart.\nWhen we met after our respective escapades, Bushi muttered in disgust that sex without emotion was nothing but a physical act requiring detached concentration. To help him quench his sorrows respecting the waste of money, I treated him to a donner kebab: the Turkish version of our pita-falafel. Devouring it enthusiastically, Bushi looked at me gratefully.\n“First you have to fill your stomach and only thereafter enjoy moral escapades,” he told me, misquoting Bertolt Brecht.\nAnother amusing incident took place when we made a stopover in Capri. Bushi was keen to proceed to Anacapri – the plateau – and visit the villa St. Michele constructed by the Swede, Axel Munthe. I knew that the latter’s book, dealing with the years he had spent on building the villa, intrigued Bushi. There were some bus services from the beach to the upper part but Bushi wanted to follow the steps of the founder. Knowing that my earlier heart attack ruled such an effort out as far as I was concerned, Bushi suggested that I remain in one of the numerous outlets by the beach. He proceeded to climb the stairs. His guide, an attractive young girl, brought a donkey which, she said, Bushi could ride.\nFor a while I watched them. As anticipated, Bushi dismounted the donkey which (Bushi later told me) found the steep climb tiring. I was amused to note how Bushi followed – looking exhausted – and (I suspected) panting. It occurred to me that here there was a charming entrepreneur followed by two donkeys.\nA few hours later, Bushi stumbled back into my cafeteria. He looked worn out and disappointed. Lugubriously, he muttered:\n“Munthe tells us that his method of building was to erect, destroy and then rebuild so as to fit his latest caprice. What a pity he rebuilt; the ruins would have been more appropriate than the vainglorious dwelling he dreamt up.”\nThe last episode took place in the mountain resort of Zermatt in Switzerland, which was our final destination. Toward the end of our farewell dinner – in a posh restaurant – I asked Bushi, bluntly, whether he felt more at ease overseas than in Israel. After reflection, he conceded that, by nature, he had remained a Diaspora Jew.\n“I like people but, usually, keep my distance. You are one of the few with whom I am open. In Israel people resent what they regard as aloofness.”\n“I suspect it is shyness,” I told him, “but, you know, I fear you may spend your life out of Israel.”\n“It’s possible,” he conceded.\n“Let us then meet here, in Zermatt, in forty years. I’ll book a table in Restaurant Zemattschein in your name.”\n“Why not in yours?”\n“I may change my name again; who knows. You won’t: you are a real stick-in-the-mud. You feel that if the name was good enough for your grandfather, you might as well keep it.”\n“And suppose the Zemattschein has closed down by then?”\n“I’ll find a way to contact you.”\nNext morning, Bushi took a train to Zurich from where he intended to proceed to Vienna, to visit his father. I wanted to see Paris, London and Stratford-upon-Avon, so as to spend as much time as I could in theatres and in the study of staging.\nBefore we parted, I asked my friend to give my regards to his father and to Adele.\n“I’ll mention you to him. I’ll convey your regards to Adele if I chance upon her,” he spoke defensively.\n“I’m sure you will. But be careful: she is world-wise.”\n“You may be your brother’s keeper; but my name is Bushi; not David”\nI took a train to Geneva from where I intended to proceed to France. Before leaving our rest house, I sent an express airmail letter to David, telling him he could contact me in the Montefiore Jewish Youth Residence in Paris. On arriving there I was delighted to receive a telegram in which David advised that he proposed to join me and that he had already booked a flight.\nDavid and I had a wonderful time in Paris. Naturally, we went to see the sights, including Versailles and Malmaison. We also managed to dine in the Monmartre. My main object, though, was to spend as much time in theatres as I could afford. I recall with glee how we watched Molière’s Le Malade Imaginaire and a few day’s later Samuel Beckett’s En attendant Godot (Waiting for Godot). Although I do not speak French, I understood both plays: the acting was brilliant and the body language spoke for itself. It further dawned on me that both plays benefited from skilful staging. It constituted a good background and was marked by its simplicity.\nFrom Paris we proceeded via Belgium to London. After the magnificence of Paris, Brussels struck me as dull and staid. Still, we spent a pleasant evening in the local philharmonic orchestra. In London we went on a regular basis to the West End. Here too we saw Waiting for Godot (this time in English). We also saw a number of Oscar Wilde’s witty plays. However, from my point of view, the highlight was Stratford-upon-Avon. I was impressed by the profound acting and comprehended that to a large extent the outcome was the fruit of meticulous directing and the art of simplistic staging. On our return to London we were delighted to see that Cosi Fan Tutte (a Mozart opera) was performed in the Coliseum. Notwithstanding the dwindling of our funds, we decided to see it. I am glad we did.\nWe were flat broke when we embarked on our flight back to Israel. The aesthetic experience, though, was worth every penny we spent. Oddly enough the appreciation of good acting – involving the need for rapport with the audience – helped me a great deal later in life, when I had to prepare sermons. Once again, I am jumping the gun. Still, today – as an aging man who writes his autobiography – I am convinced that good public speaking is in reality a modicum of good acting.\nBushi, too, returned to Tel Aviv after visiting his father in Vienna. I am satisfied that he met Adele although he did not mention her name. I myself was occupied with another upheaval, namely the mobilisation of the Israeli Defence Forces upon the outbreak of the Suez Crisis. The episode requires a detailed discussion.\nThe man who dominated the Arab world at that time was the leader of Egypt, Gamal Abdul [Abdel] Nasser. One of his belligerent acts was the nationalisation of the Suez Canal and the closure of the Straits of Tiran to ships carrying goods to the Israeli port of Eilat. In effect, the Straits had been closed to ships carrying the Israeli flag from 1951. However, a ship sailing under another flag, such as Liberia’s, was not searched and could proceed to Eilat without interference. Nasser’s measure changed the situation. In addition, the nationalization of the Canal was bound to deplete the revenues of British and French enterprises.\nTo protect their interests, Britain and France entered into a secret pact with Israel, which mobilised its militia and attacked the Egyptian garrisons in the Sinai Peninsula. As an officer in the infantry, I was called up. Shosh (with whom I kept in touch), took the view that, in view of my health issues in recent years, I should ask for a supplementary medical examination. She pointed out that if a fresh heart attack disabled me, my men would be in disarray. After some reflection, I rejected her advice. I sensed that I had made a full recovery and had no wish to malinger.\nThe crisis had been the subject of numerous political analyses and I do not think I have much to add. Israel’s main object was to secure access through the Straits of Tiran. To achieve this object, our military captured the sparsely populated Sinai Peninsula. My unit fought in two battles: the ‘Hedgehog’ (Abu Uwayadulah) and Sharm El Sheik: Nasser’s main station for controlling the Straits.\nIt is well-known that Israel won and that the United States administration stepped in and secured a ceasefire cum resolution of the Suez dispute. Under it, Sinai became controlled by observers of the United Nations, one of whose tasks was to secure free shipping through the Straits of Tiran. The Canal itself remained in Egypt’s hands. However, Nasser had sunk ships that had entered the Canal when the crisis broke out and so it remained impassable for some two years.\nBy and large, Israel was jubilant. One person to voice doubts was my friend Bushi, with whom I discussed my experiences when we went for lunch in a restaurant in Ramleh, an Arab town near Tel Aviv. Bushi, who drove us over, averred that Israel made a blunder when it entered into a pact with two colonial powers, one of which had been treated as an adversary before we became an independent State.\n“We do all we can to unite the Muslim World,” he said sarcastically. “Indirectly, Nasser has attained his object: he has established that Israel is a European enclave amidst the predominantly Arab region of the Middle East.”\n“Well spoken for a declared Canaanite, who believes we ought to integrate with other people in the land,” I grinned. “But, Bushi, don’t you think we have to improvise before we lose the ability to manoeuvre?”\n“Perhaps,” he conceded. “But are we manoeuvring in the right direction?”\n“As an officer and army man, I simply obey orders. I attempt to carry out the tasks set to me. I believe I have.”\n“Tell me a bit about your exploits, please.”\nBushi listened attentively. He was impressed with our campaigns and with the fighting spirit that had motivated me and my men. Although he was a self-declared pacifist, he was moved when I told him how we had stormed enemy positions. When I told him how I had led my men, he congratulated me.\n“You are a man of courage, Pilkin,” he told me warmly. “You have guts.”\n“In Sharm El Sheik a complete division surrendered to us,” I told him proudly. “The survivors were released when the crisis was over.”\n“The survivors?” he asked perplexed.\n“Well two prisoners were German volunteers. I shot them!”\nBushi drove on without saying another word. When we arrived at our destination, I ordered a chicken dish. To my surprise, Bushi ordered stewed rabbit: food prohibited under our dietary laws in the same manner as pork. Usually, when we went out together, Bushi, who was familiar with my traditional outlook, ordered chicken or fish so as not to offend my sensibilities. He was acting out of character.\n“What’s the matter, Bushi?”\n“What made you shoot these two fellows?”\n“I already told you: they were Germans. Half my family perished in Nazi concentration camps.”\n“But how old were the chaps you killed?”\n“In their twenties, I think.”\n“They could not have been involved in WWII. You visited the sins of the fathers on their offspring.”\n“And if I did? Suppose you came across a Gestapo man, wouldn’t you kill him?”\n“I am not sure, Pilkin. Socrates tells us that revenge is unending. And I believe in Gandhi’s words to the effect that if everybody asked an eye for an eye, the whole world would be blind. I prefer to forget the past and start afresh. And, in any event, I do not hate Germans of the younger generation.”\nWe finished our meal in silence. Bushi was lost in thoughts. I knew him well: he was and would remain one of my few friends. I also appreciated that his main aim was to avoid controversy. This, however, did not stop him from expressing his view when he felt the need. I recalled with warmth how he used to snap back when cornered.\nHe gave vent to his feelings when we drove back to Tel Aviv: “Pilkin, when one of our people cheats a person in the Ukraine or in a Balkan country, the victim doesn’t say: ‘What a crook.’ He mutters: ‘That crooked Yid’. We then say that the victim is anti-Semitic. Isn’t your hatred of all Germans similar?”\nSeeing I kept my silence, he asked: “Do you intend to tell this to anyone else?”\n“I already told it to Shosh. Her reaction was similar to yours.”\n“It might be best if you refrained from mentioning this episode to others.”\nToday, when I am composing my autobiography, I am inclined towards Bushi’s view. A prisoner of war should not be treated as a criminal unless he is convicted by a court with the requisite jurisdiction. All the same, I have forgiven myself. When I discharged my gun, I had acted on the spur of the moment and in the wake of a raging battle. Undoubtedly, my present calling, which is anchored in Orthodox Judaism, postulates that vengeance is the domain of God Almighty (Deut. 32:35). Nowadays I would be able to control my temper even in critical situations and quench the urge to punish. At the very same time, I have learned to forgive and forget the misdoings of other people. Should I really use a different criterion when I recall my own past?\nAs already related, Israel’s main achievement was the securing of free passage through the Straits of Tiran. Many young parents would have liked to opt for ‘Tiran’ when choosing the proper name of a newborn baby-boy. In Hebrew, though, ‘Tiran’ may be construed as ‘tyrant’. It was, therefore, better to avoid it. Nevertheless, I know a few fellows who were given this unorthodox name. Most of them dropped it later in life.\nLiterally the verse reads: ‘With one he toiled and the other was holding the sword.’ The translation quoted in the text seeks to convey the idea.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novels/bright-lion/part-2/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"2-an-odd-jobs-boy\"\u003e2.

A telephone call she received when I delivered Ranjan’s parcel convinced me that my friend was not the only man in her life. Out of curiosity, I accepted her invitation to a party in her flat but, in the event, left early as I found it difficult to fit with her guests. Still, before long I met colleagues, mainly from the English literature department, with whom I was able to mix.\nBy the time Ranjan returned to our base, I had a circle of friends. Ranjan did not mingle with them. This, however, did not lead to an estrangement. Ranjan and I lunched together regularly and occasionally went to the cinema or a theatre – usually in the company of Ranjan’s then girlfriend. But I did not become a party to Ranjan’s dabbling in the local stock exchange or to his semi-professional socialising with the local Bar. Ranjan, in turn, did not accompany me on my excursions to the antiques shops and to the emerging Singaporean art galleries.\nThe well-defined Oxford-bond kept us together. Each stood up for the other when needed. On one occasion, for instance, an Indian colleague, who had committed an insurance fraud, tried to defend himself by asserting that Ranjan had advised him on the ploy and had encouraged him to go ahead. When the fraud was discovered, Ranjan was away, pursuing a higher degree at Harvard. Seeking to get to the bottom of the matter, our Dean, who had to attend to a few University matters in the United States, decided to confront him. My telephone call, apprising Ranjan of what had taken place and aided him to clear his name. Ranjan, in turn, helped me out of difficult wrangling in Faculty matters and forewarned me whenever he sensed I might be making a wrong turn.\nOur friendship stood the test despite Ranjan’s frowning at my friendship with Tay Fung-Shuo and Yuan-Ming. Resenting my ever-growing affinity with my art haven and my increasing spells away from the University, Ranjan used to tease me about my mysterious links with the East. With a sarcastic smile, he ‘wondered’ whether I would eventually appear in the Law School in a Sen Fu – the old fashioned local Chinese silk suit.\nOne episode that took place during that period gave me an insight into a side of Ranjan I had, until then, been unaware of. One afternoon, Tay Fung-Shou – accompanied by Yuan-Ming – drove over to the University in order to call on our museum’s curator. When they arrived, Yuan-Ming decided to come over to my office. Being unfamiliar with our widely spread campus, she lost her way but, fortunately, was helped by one of my students, who had seen me with her in a coffee shop in Pagoda Street.\nYuan-Ming, who was then in the golden age in which little girls emulate their mothers, made tea for us and told me that my shabby office would look better if I put up a curtain. She was still considering what sort of curtain to make, when the door burst open.\n“Have you forgotten our 4 o’clock departmental meeting, Peter?” Ranjan let his displeasure show. “You know I count on you for this Vice Deanship business.”\n“You better go to your meeting, Uncle,” volunteered Yuan-Ming, who saw I was taken aback. “I’ll find my way to the museum.”\n“No way,” I told her. “I’ll take you back; and Ranjan, you better tell our colleagues I’ll be a few minutes late.”\n“I suppose they’ll have to wait,” Ranjan broke into a smile. “And so this is your friend. Peter told me a lot about you, young Lady.”\n“Only good things I hope,” she countered readily.\n“You better check with him,” grinned Ranjan. “Well, Peter, we’ll see you soon.”\nYuan-Ming kept mum as we walked together to the museum. I sensed she wanted to tell me something but was uncertain whether to go ahead. She came out with it as soon as I prompted.\n“I don’t like your friend, Uncle,” she said frankly.\n“But why? You saw him for just a few minutes; and he was agitated.”\n“Oh, I know that, Uncle; and of course he’s an Indian or Ceylonese. So you can’t expect him to have good manners!”\n“Oh,” I muttered, nonplussed. I was, of course, aware of the prevailing anti-Indian prejudices of the local Chinese population but – somehow – had not expected to detect their impact on my young friend. “But then,” I asked, “why do you dislike him; he’s just a Hay!”\n“It’s not that” she said, giggling at my use of the derogatory word – meaning black – applied by Singapore’s Chinese to members of the Ceylonese and Indian communities. “It’s not that, Uncle. It’s his smile!”\n“But wasn’t he friendly before he left?”\n“He was, Uncle; but you know, his eyes didn’t smile. They remained hard!”\nThe unimportant Faculty business, that had led to Ranjan’s outburst, was settled readily in the way he wanted. To my relief, he did not refer again to my having been late for the meeting. Having sensed the way the land lay, he ceased to tease me about my Chinatown link. He even went over to Tay’s store before his next visit to Colombo and purchased a costly jadeite bracelet for his mother. Both Tay and Yuan-Ming were civil to him. All the same, I sensed that Tay’s assessment of Ranjan coincided with his charming daughter’s.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/a-candid-obituary/chapter-3/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAgnes turned out to be a vivacious English-educated Chinese, some five or six years older than Ranjan.

I was relieved when one of the firm’s employees offered to drive us through the hectic traffic of the town to the shore of the Rhine. A tour of the dome was complemented by our lengthy visit to the nearby Germanic museum, a modern structure encapsulating a Roman mosaic. It was laid bare in the bombing attacks of 1944 after being hidden under the ground for over a thousand years.\nEarly in the afternoon, we started our trip up the Rhine. At dusk we took a two bedroom suite in a hotel in Bacharach, a popular resort marked by its narrow cobble stoned streets, by its medieval fortifications and by the traditional German master-builder houses with exposed gables and beams.\nNext morning we visited Burg Rheinfels. Standing by a window in the tower, we admired the Rhine valley. We then took the ferry to the other shore of the river and drove to Kaub - where Prince Blücher’s army crossed the Rhine on its way to the Battle of Waterloo.\n“But is there no bridge across the Rhine?” asked Yuan Ming, viewing the ferry with apprehension.\n“We’d have to drive all the way back to Koblenz; crossing by ferry is faster and perfectly safe.”\nYuan Ming looked at me with renewed anxiety when I drove the car up the steep narrow slip road to Gutenfels Castle, where I had reserved a suite.\nYuan Ming’s expression brightened when she looked down at the Rhine from the window of the comfortable sitting room in our suite.\n“Have you stayed here before?” she wanted to know.\n“No, I haven’t. Pat refused to come with me when I drove up; she remained in the hotel by the river. But I spent some time on my own on the terrace; and I kept thinking of you.”\n“Of me or of ‘her’”?\n“I was still looking for you then; and thinking of you as you were then; but I knew you would like it up here.”\n“I do” she agreed, “it’s the top of world. But these silly and clumsy barges on the Rhine spoil the view.”\n“Try to imagine they are medieval merchantmen, flying their flag.”\n“I shall; and tell me, are we near Loreley?”\n“I think it’s the third hilltop down the River” I said, with some uncertainty. “You know the story?”\n“I do; you told it to ‘her’ – remember? It’s an uncanny story. And I don’t know why the creatures that lured the poor sailors up in order to slay them had to be females. They could be sexless goblins! Your Western folklore was dreamt up by a bunch of MCPs.”\n“Sure; but, then, all the minstrels and ballad singers were men; and quite a pack of rowdies at that.”\nAfter dinner, Yuan Ming assembled her easel on our balcony and started to draw. The steady rhythm of her right hand told me she had planned her painting beforehand and was executing it with her usual confidence and precision. She did not, however, display the excitement I had detected when she had a breakthrough or was drawing an entirely new piece transcending her earlier works. When she finished, she turned me: “Come over and have a look, Uncle.”\nShe had drawn an eerie replica of the castle. On a nearby spooky Loreley a flock of goblins was tempting sailors, who had jumped overboard or had fallen off fighting vessels, to climb up and partake in a nocturnal feast. On the terrace of our castle, two women, adorned in colourful medieval apparel, were trying to warn them off.\n“What do you think of it?”\n“You caught the atmosphere of the place,” I assured her.\n“It ain’t a breakthrough, Uncle.”\n“Perhaps not; but you have fine tuned the colours. It will be snapped up in your exhibition.”\n“It might,” she agreed. Having carried the easel with the still wet drawing back to the sitting room, she added: “But look, Uncle, for a while I’ve been looking for completely new ideas. As you know I tried \u0026hellip;”\n“In the painting you haven’t completed for your forthcoming exhibition?”\n“Yes, Uncle. And I destroyed it before I left LA; you guessed, didn’t you?”\n“I knew something was wrong; you see, you didn’t refer to it since you came over.”\n“It was a refinement of my earlier works; I am looking for an added dimension.”\n“I believe you are getting there.”\n“What makes you think so? This drawing – I’m calling it ‘Her Loreley’ – isn’t in the same class as ‘Dawn’ or ‘Ablaze at Noon”.\n“True,” I conceded. “Your new piece doesn’t display the same spontaneous outburst of emotions and doesn’t have the same compelling effect. But there is something special about its colours; you have used them in a different manner; as if they had a message of their own.”\nNodding her head, she placed the easel in a corner. She then came over to the sofa and sat next to me.\n“So you think I’m on my way?”\n“I do; although I’m not certain what you are aiming at.”\n“How, then, can you be optimistic?”\n“Because you are searching; just as you did previously.”\n“But aren’t you swayed by your emotions when you discuss my work.”\n“I don’t think so. But why not tell me what you are looking for?”\n“I wish I knew myself; all I know is that I want to find a new dimension. I don’t want to use the same old style and technique for the next twenty years.”\n“Then you are bound to find what you’re after; good artists always do if they persevere; as long as they have the zest.”\nAfter a good night’s rest, Yuan Ming was, again, her exuberant self. Sliding into the driver’s seat, she turned to me: “It’s a long way to Breisach, Uncle; so I better drive!”\nFor most of the time, she fell in line with the cars in the fast lane of the Autobahn. Occasionally, though, I had to suppress my anxiety when she overtook more leisurely moving vehicles. She, in turn, got furious when some drivers refused to give way.\nThe car continued its steady progress southward. As we circumnavigated Mainz, my thoughts strayed from the young woman, who handled the car so dexterously, to little Yuan Ming of my youth in Singapore. She too had been temperamental, gliding from one mood to another. Occasionally, her little girl’s outbursts had been hard to take. Still, she had never angered me and, as soon as a storm was over, I dismissed it from my mind. My recollections had always focused on our delightful outings: the occasional trips to Kota Tinggi, the afternoons we spent together in the Chinese Swimming Club and on the beach, her visits to my study in the University and the sketches she had drawn when she had been with me.\n“You are thinking of ‘her’, Uncle”.\n“Well, yes: you are really still the same: full of beans and good to be with.”\n“And quite as likely to throw a tantrum,” she supplemented\n“But you really weren’t a problem: not as far as I was concerned.”\n“Not as far as you were concerned!” she mimicked. “Great wonder. ‘She’ doted on you. So once Uncle looked at her sadly or contritely, not daring to stroke her hair for fear of a rebuff, she melted. And then ‘she’ climbed on your lap and let you pacify her, after which all was well again.”\n“But you – I mean ‘she’ – always responded to reason!”\nA lull in our conversation enabled me to venture, once again, back into the past. I kept thinking of her drawings, her first attempt to use oils and her decision to confine herself to Chinese ink and aquarelle. She had to review her decision in her adult life, when she became a sought after artist in Los Angeles; but her original decision – at the age of eleven – had been sound. She had sensed that oil paints did not enable her to execute a perfect stroke and, in addition, had found it easier to master her colours in the more liquid mediums.\nAs our car continued its progress in the direction of Mannheim, I let Yuan Ming’s early paintings and drawing materialise in front of my eyes. Many of them were superb and each of them had brought me joy, even the caricatures of her Dad and of myself. Over the years, she had gone from strength to strength; but was she going to make the next leap forward?\n“We have to concentrate on the road, Uncle” Yuan Ming interrupted my thoughts. “Which route to take after we by-pass Karlsruhe?”\n“The main route to Basle; we exit the Autobahn just before Freiburg; but you must be getting pretty tired.”\n“Just a bit; and how long is it from here to Breisach?”\n“At your speed, probably three hours. But it’s high time we stop for lunch.”\nYuan Ming was considerably more tired than I had appreciated. After a hurried meal in the next Autobahn resort, she let me take the driver’s seat. As soon our BMW joined the traffic, she closed her eyes.\nYuan Ming slept soundly during the last stretch of our lengthy trip. I, in turn, had to concentrate on the road, proceeding steadily on the middle lane of the Autobahn. Despite the tedious road and the abusive gestures of overtaking drivers, I felt elated. Yuan Ming’s words confirmed that she was getting close to her target. She had been equally restless and subject to bouts of insomnia before she had executed her earlier major works.\nOur ride got bumpy, after I left the Autobahn. Soon Yuan Ming opened her eyes: “Is this the Kaiserstuhl, Uncle?”\n“Yap.”\n“Where is the Rhine?”\n“A few kilometres to the West. We’ll greet her again at Breisach.”\n“It’s lovely here,” she said as we went through picturesque villages. “The houses are so cute. Not as grand as up North, but homely.\nWhen we reached our destination, we decided to avoid the luxury hotel by the Rhine and, instead, took two rooms in a comfortable inn. Yuan Ming viewed her room, with its heavy old fashioned furniture, with glee. Stepping out to the balcony, she announced happily:\n“And, Uncle, you do get a glimpse of the Rhine from out here.”\n“Splendid; and what does your young Ladyship wish to do now?”\n“Your young Ladyship wants to have a shower and a decent rest. When do they serve dinner?”\n“From about 6.30; but the restaurant remains open till 9.30.”\n13. The Breakthrough We had cocktails before dinner. Relaxing in the small bar adjacent to the dining room, I experiencing the happiness and fulfilment which overcame me when I was with her. It was – had always been – a Platonic friendship and bound to remain so. It was, at the same time, more constant and more deeply ingrained than a relationship cemented by a physical bond. True, ‘out of bounds’ had been defined. But the territory within the region was fertile and comforting.\n“Uncle,” she said after a while, “sometime, when we are together, I feel sorry for your wife. You never loved her.”\n“True,” I admitted. “But I don’t think she felt much for me either. For years she kept hankering after that Chinese chap who jilted her when she contracted TB.”\n“She might have forgotten him if you had given her a chance.”\n“Possibly; but it wasn’t in me; and she kept aggravating me by sticking stubbornly to the values of her home. Up to this very day, she has remained closer to her brothers and sisters than to me.”\n“So you miscalculated when you thought a few years in New Zealand might bring the two of you together?” For a moment she hesitated, but then went on: “And you, too, kept feeling closer to your friend Tay and to ‘her’ than to Pat. Did she know?\u0026quot;\n“She knew I kept thinking of somebody.”\n“It must have been tough on her.”\nYuan Ming had put her finger on the rot. Throughout my unhappy marriage I managed to find outlets: a small group of bridge players in Singapore and in Wellington; a circle of Jewish acquaintances in Melbourne and a circle of art connoisseurs after my return to Singapore. I had also joined some professional bodies. In this manner I filled in time and managed to sidestep the central problem. Pat’s affiliations centred on her family; and her disappointment with life centred on me.\n“I’m sure it was tough on her,” I admitted. “She could have made things easier for herself if she had learned to accept, or at least to understand, our Western world. But she didn’t adjust; even today she judges everything by the yardstick of her Eastern family.”\n“But, then, haven’t you remained a Westerner?”\n“ I have; but, in the very least, I can manage in my Eastern society, including Pat’s family.”\n“But Eastern society has always been tolerant to European and other barbarians; we ‘forgive’ their ‘mistakes’. Also, Uncle, your background made you adaptable. Your family fled from Vienna to Tel-Aviv. Much later you moved on to Oxford, to Singapore, to Wellington and eventually to Melbourne. To survive, you had to open your mind. From what you told me, Pat’s horizon was set by her family.”\n“And I was dead wrong when I thought I could change her.”\n“I’m afraid you were, Uncle Pygmalion. If ‘she’ had appreciated the risks involved, she would have tried to stop you; but in many ways ‘she’ was still a child.”\n“Still,” I turned to the bright side, “here we are together on the Rhine: so all is well.”\n“But what will happen when you return to Singapore, Uncle?”\n“We’ll see. At the moment Pat is in Taiwan. When I rang her before we left London, she told me she was going to spend a month or so with her church friend in Tainan. The orphanage needed an extra pair of hands. She asked me not to ring her there.”\n“Why don’t you send her a postcard?”\n“I didn’t tell her I was going to spend some time on the Continent; I’ll send her one when we’re back in London.”\n“And buy her a nice gift; you may ward off the storm!”\nWe stayed in the Kaiserstuhl for the next few days. Yuan Ming admired the cobblestone paths, the charming vineyards basking in the sun and the fine cellars stocked with large fragrant wooden barrels filled with maturing wine. She kept drawing and sketching incessantly during our last day in the Kaiserstuhl.\nShe remained as animated during our drive to Lake Constance. To avoid getting embroiled in the traffic between Freiburg and Basle, I took the winding roads of the Black Forest. Even as we drove, Yuan Ming kept sketching. Occasionally, she asked me to stop for while and enjoyed the view.\n“Uncle,” she said whilst we proceeded at a slow pace in the direction of Schafhausen; “the Black Forest must be quite something in the winter, when it’s snowing.”\n“It is: the cedar trees look majestic when they’re covered in white. But you have to be careful. One afternoon I lost my clutch when I drove through the snow; lucky for me, a truck with a kindly driver passed bye. He towed me all the way to a garage.”\n“I can imagine how you felt,” she said, adding spontaneously; “but look, why don’t we stop for a while and go for a walk in the forest.”\n“Good idea!”\nTo her disappointment, we found no strawberries. Soon, though, she spotted a squirrel climbing a tree. Halting on one of the upper branches, it brushed its moustache with its forepaws. It then waived its bushy tail, and descended into a hole in the trunk. To my delight, Yuan Ming sketched it as an elf, dancing gracefully in front of a snow covered tree.\nI made another stop at Rheinfall, with the imposing waterfalls feeding the Rhine. I could sense Yuan Ming\u0026rsquo;s excitement.\n“They’re not as imposing as the Niagara’s; but there is more life to them, life and rhythm; and look at the reflection of the light when the water roars past us.”\nAfter lunch, we continued our journey along the Swiss shore of Lake Constance. Once again, Yuan Ming sketched fervently. She paused for a while when we crossed the Austrian border, but soon resumed her work.\n“So we are in a pretty cosmopolitan part of Europe, Uncle. We started near the French border, drove through the Black Forest, continued to Switzerland; and now we are in your home country.”\n“If you want to call it that; but, yes, we are on an Alpine cross roads; and don’t forget that Liechtenstein and Italy are just around the corner.”\nLater in the afternoon, we reached Bregenz and proceeded to upper Lochau. A warm, appreciative, smile descended on Yuan Ming’s face when the maid opened the door of our suite, with its dark stained cathedral beams and the wide sliding glass doors opening to the veranda. It deepened as she stepped out and let her eyes wander from the attractive whitewashed farm houses, spread on the meadows down the steep hill, to the expanse of the deep blue Lake Constance right beneath us.\n“So you had your a plan all along, Uncle?”\n“I knew you would like it here,” I affirmed. “It’s the sort of place we used to talk about long ago \u0026hellip;”\n“When ‘she’ was watching you with her big black eyes?”\nA splendid Austrian dinner, preceded by a stroll through the compact village square and main road, brought our wanderings for that day to their end. The ebullient even if inward looking expression that dwelt on Yuan Ming’s face, made my heart leap with joy. It was a mien I had good reason to recall. Her elation deepened as we stepped out, once again, onto our veranda. I watched keenly as her glance fastened for a while on the lights of the small German island city of Lindau, just a short drive away from us, and then travelled further into the distance, to Friedrichshafen, onward to the border city of Constance and then back to Bregenz. Suddenly, a shooting star brightened the clear night sky, ascending proudly above us. For a moment it hovered over a ship sailing on the lake, its sparkle merged with the lights of the upper deck. It then descended, appearing to fall into the lake.\n“This is exciting, Uncle,” she said. “I only hope this ship isn’t another stupid barge.”\n“It’s a tourist boat,” I assured her. “Tomorrow, we can take a night cruise and have dinner on board. But it’s really nicer up here.”\n“I’m sure it is,” she said, adding with a smile: “and now, Uncle, it’s time for Yuan Ming’s beauty sleep. It’s been a splendid day; but now it’s time for bed.”\nA draft from the window, which I had left slightly ajar, woke me up early next morning. To my surprise, Yuan was not in her room. For a few moments I panicked. Had it all been a mirage? Was I, in reality, back in my own barren bedroom in Singapore. Then, as the last grains of sleep receded from my eyes, reason drove me back to reality. Glancing around me, I tiptoed to the door separating the bedrooms from the small lounge.\nTo my relief, she was standing by her easel, looking fresh and resolute. I was about to withdraw noiselessly to my bedroom, when – without turning her head – she said: “No, don’t go back; come over here, Uncle.”\n“How long have you been working?”\n“For quite a while; I watched dawn; it was lovely.”\n“Is all going well?”\n“I had a good start; but I’ve come up against a snag.”\nTwo discarded sheets of rice paper, lying crumbled on the floor, bore witness to her frustration. Trying to comfort her, I stroked her hair. After a short while, she turned to me.\n“I was about to call it a day; but perhaps I’ll have another go.”\n“What’s the problem? I observed how you planned it yesterday, during dinner.”\n“I did; and the idea is fine; it’s just one detail; I just can’t get it right.”\n“Not the lighting or the colours?”\n“No; of course not: they’re the mainstream \u0026hellip;” she was about to continue when I realised where she had gone astray.\n“Don’t tell me,” I said; “it must have something to do with the image of one of us!”\n“So it does, Uncle Know-All,” she said, her jest flattened by the strain in her voice “it’s ‘her’!”\n“Don’t tell me you are trying to draw your - I mean ‘her’ - portrait?”\n“But I am; I’m portraying ‘her’ with you. You are easy, except that I haven’t decided if I you are to look cute, funny or wistful. But” she wailed “I can’t get ‘her’ right!”\n“But, for heaven’s sake, Yuan Ming,” I lost my cool; “to portray yourself as a child without even a photograph to look at – that’s a mammoth task.”\n“But it’s not as if I can’t remember ‘her’ face; I stared at it often enough in the mirror. Still; something about ‘her’ countenance eludes me now.”\n“Why not let me have a look;not at the whole painting: just your – I mean ‘her’ – portrait.”\n“You know I’m not supposed to!”\nShe was alluding to the unwritten traditions of the X’ian School that had elected her a “Master Artist”, an honour rarely conferred on an overseas Chinese. Mystified as I had remained by the School’s firm edict against the showing of an incomplete work, I had paid due respect to the Code. At present, though, we were facing a crisis. I was still searching for persuasive arguments justifying an exception, when Yuan Ming made up her mind.\n“But I suppose even these rules can be bent when needed,” she said, tearing a small piece off one of the discarded drawings. Noting my apprehensive start, she told me: “Once discarded, it’s only a piece of wastepaper, Uncle.”\n“Well,” she asked after I had been examining the delicate portrait for a few minutes, “where did I go wrong?”\n“It’s ‘her’ alright; but, to start with, there’s something wrong with the nose.”\n“Don’t tell me ‘she’ had a snub nose; Chinese girls don’t have them.”\n“No, ‘she’ didn’t have a snub nose; but it wasn’t as flat as you’ve drawn it.”\n“Let’s see how to change it,” she said, overtly encouraged. Putting her brush aside, she sketched the face again with a light blue crayon.\n“Better?” she asked.\n“Just about right now; but there is also something wrong with the cheekbones; your face was a bit more round then.”\n“And how is this?” she asked after a further attempt.\n“It will do” I said.\n“Anything still bothering you” she asked searchingly.\n“ ‘Her’ eyes.”\n“Don’t tell me they were even bigger?”\n“No, they weren’t; but you are portraying us together, aren’t you?”\n“I am indeed!”\n“You - I mean ‘she’ - used to look at me more directly!” I said.\n“Spot on,” I told her happily when she completed the next sketch. “And can I have the sketch?”\n“You’ve earned it,” she consented magnanimously; “but now I must go ahead with the final version!”\nStanding by her side, I admired the rhythm of her steady movements. Occasionally, she stepped closer to the easel or bent slightly forward to dip her brush in one of the coloured ink pads. Once or twice she stopped for a few seconds, changed her brush and looked critically at her work. I had by then discerned that it comprised individual subjects rendered in fine detail and larger abstract forms executed in deeper colours and lose shapes.\nA lull in her steady beat brought me back to the world around me. From the corner of my eye, I saw the Dancing Harlequin, smiling at me from the top of a nearby chest of drawers.\n“Are you bringing him in?” I asked.\n“Yes, of course; right at the top; but I’m not certain in which direction he ought to look.”\n“Yours, naturally?”\n“And why?”\n“Because his is the spirit of creativity, of inspiration, of dreams.”\n“Then he ought to look at both of us” she concluded softly.\nSelecting a fine brush, she moved closer to the easel. For once, her hand moved slowly, delicately, occasionally just allowing the brush to touch the fine rice paper. I, in turn, was holding my breath.\n“That’s it” she said at long last; “you can breathe again normally now and have a look.”\nThe large drawing – entitled “Harlequinade” – differed from all her previous works. Scenes from our journeys through life, portrayed in fine detail, were overshadowed by amorphous, intertwined, shapes creating a dynamic atmosphere. What struck me most, though, was the innovative application of the colours. Scenes from early years were drawn in light, harmonious, shades. The waterfalls of Kota Tinggi, the beach in the Sisters Island and my study in the Japanese Block of the University of Singapore were all executed in this manner. She had also drawn an image of her father’s old shop. Events from our more recent years were enlivened in deeper and richer colours. The drawing of ‘Dawn’ and a scene in the new swimming pool were followed by highlights from our trips. The sight of a goblin above Loreley brought a smile to my face. Lower down she had drawn us standing together by the easel. Right at the top, at the upper left corner, the Dancing Harlequin was smiling benignly.\nThe magnificent drawing was further enhanced by the coloured shapes, which created a sense of motion, as if the work kept rotating. In her previous works she had, occasionally, achieved the same effect by an interplay of the shapes, bringing to mind the steps of a dance. This impression was now deepened by the manipulations of the colours, which appeared to gain a life of their own.\n“I can see and hear the colours,” I told her in an emotionally charged voice. “It is as if you have added a tune – some music – to the scenes. And they are fresher and deeper than ever before.”\n“So you think I have made it?”\n“I do!”\nFor a moment she remained by the easel looking fulfilled, happy but, at the same time, exhausted. She fell asleep as soon as she got back to her bed. When she woke up – some two hours later on – she smiled at me warmly: “You must be hungry, Uncle?”\n“A bit; how about you?”\n“I’d like stay in bed a bit longer; why don’t you go down and have your breakfast. You can bring me back a coffee and some rolls and jam.”\nYuan Ming enjoyed the strongly brewed coffee and then spread the homemade strawberry jam on the two rolls. When she finished, I placed the tray outside the door of the suite and attached the “Do not Disturb” tag to the handle.\n“Uncle,” she said when I stepped back into her room, “mind telling me again what you think of the ‘Harlequinade’?”\n“It surpasses everything you have done before; it’s a masterpiece.”\n“Which scene did you like best?”\n“The one where we sit together in my old study, with you \u0026hellip;”\n“You mean ‘her’ …” she interjected.\n“Very well then, with ‘her’ giving me that special, wistful, look.”\n“Alright then, Uncle,” she said after a short lull; “but is it better than all the stuff ‘she’ drew?”\n“It is; ‘she’ could not have conceived anything as complex and as elaborate.”\n“But how about the execution? I still want to know why you have never let me see ‘her’ drawings and sketches. And you have quite a few, don’t you?”\n“Two hundred and thirteen, to be accurate!”\n“Why did you hide them from me?”\n“ ‘She’ had a special trick with her colours; they were fresh and expressive. I thought it best to let you get there again without showing you ‘her’ works.”\n“Am I there now?”\n“You are! Perhaps even more so than ever before.”\nShe was, again, relaxing. I was too happy to break the harmony, too elated to disrupt the sense of peace and bliss. I knew she had continued to draw consistently during the many years we had been out of touch. Her eyes had remained sharp and observant; her brushes had retained their dexterity; but her colours had lost their lustre. Something had been missing; but, at long last, she had found her way back.\nWe lunched on the premises. In the afternoon, we drove down to Lindau. During dinner in a restaurant by the boat quay, Yuan Ming suggested that, instead of proceeding to Vienna, we spend the remaining days of our trip in the region. Smiling happily, I agreed.\nWe stayed an extra day in Lochau and then proceeded to Liechtenstein. We crossed to Austrian Tyrol through the spectacular Arlbergpass, spending a night by the Italian border. From there we drove through the network of secondary roads to the Kizbühler Alps. As if by agreement, we made our stops in the smaller, more secluded, resorts.\nYuan Ming’s enthusiasm manifested itself again as she watched the scenery along the winding mountain road to Canazei in the heart of the Dolomites. To my delight, she took the easel out of the boot of the car.\nDuring our first two days in Canazei, Yuan Ming sketched frantically. On the third day she left her easel behind.\n“I need a rest, Uncle,” she said. “I’ve done more drawings on our trip than in the previous six months. So it’s right to leave the easel and sketchbook behind.”\nIt was during that last day, on our way back from our afternoon walk, that Yuan Ming came up with a question that had crossed my own mind from time to time. We had just finished a steep descent through a forest path and were resting on a tree trunk.\n“Uncle,” she said, “we’ve been to some of the cutest spots in Europe.”\n“We have indeed,” I agreed.\n“The scenery is lovely and each place has an atmosphere of its own.”\n“It has; but what are you driving at, Yuan Ming?”\n“Tell me, Uncle, how many famous artists lived and created in these places; how many composers and how many novelists and poets?”\n“The only artist I can think of is that Egger-Lienz fellow; but he wasn’t really top class; and I can’t think of any composers or novelists.”\n“I suppose the really talented ones went to the bigger centres? I suspect that the big cities had their magnetic effect, the limelight, the action; and the nobility offered its patronage to penniless young artists and musicians.”\n“The nobility and later on the wealthy bourgeoisie,” I corrected. “Any other reasons?”\n“And those who weren’t ambitious remained behind and ended up like our Egger-Lienz.”\n“Quite,” I agreed, “and, of course, they failed to develop. An artist needs to understudy his master; he needs to slave in a studio; and a musician has to be trained. He usually learns from his maestro and from the response of a sophisticated audience.”\n“How about novelists?”\n“They’re different: a talented writer can develop from reading alone. He needn’t be attached, or have direct access, to a literary circle. Think of Jane Austin, the Brontés and, possibly, Herman Hesse. They made it mainly because they had the gift, the perseverance and - Yuan Ming - luck.”\n“Luck?” she burst out laughing. “You are again on your hobby horse, Uncle.”\n“Guilty as charged; but remember, Yuan Ming, every author needs to find a publisher. The Brontés might have missed out if they hadn’t hit on the idea of using male pseudonyms; and Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver would have never seen light if the manuscript, which he threw out of his carriage into the publisher’s window, had been picked up from the floor by the charwoman.”\n“And how about artists and musicians?”\n“Think about Johann Strauss the Elder: how far would he have gone without the initial patronage of Joseph Lada? He couldn’t even read notes when he arrived in Vienna!” Pausing for a moment, I added: “And I suspect I could cite example after example.”\n“Alright, Uncle Solomon” she laughed as I recovered my breath; “you’ve made your point!”\nLater on, over a pizza in a small tavern in one of the meandering lanes of Canazei, she opened up again, reverting to a subject we had covered before.\n“Uncle, you are, of course, right when you say that talent alone, even if coupled with perseverance, is not an automatic ticket to success.”\n“Well,” I prompted.\n“I’m thinking of ‘her’. ‘She’ had the talent and, even before ‘she’ showed you ‘her’ drawings; and ‘she’ had ‘her’ motivation: ‘she’ loved to see her classmates giggling at the silliness of our teachers. So ‘she’ caricatured them. Then you came into ‘her’ little sheltered world and, out of the blue, started to talk about art, about the Harlequin, about aspirations. For a long time ‘she’ didn’t dare to show you a thing: her courage failed ‘her’; ‘she’ thought you might be amused! Then, when ‘she’ realised how much you doted on ‘her’, she drew the little vase. The rest was plain sailing. So, as I told you before, your influence turned my tide.”\n“Well then, do you concede the role of chance?”\n“Not as an independent force, Uncle” she said gently; “to me, chance is the hand of fate. It drives many of us to fulfilment. We discover a dormant gift. One day you will accept my view.”\n“Perhaps,” I said; “after all I may be moved to this conclusion by chance!”\nWe left the hotel shortly after daybreak. Despite a short delay at the Austrian customs point at the Brenner Pass, we reached Innsbruck well in time for our flight back to London. Late in the afternoon, we were back in the metropolis.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-hidden-rooms/chapter-3/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"12-her-loreley\"\u003e12. ‘Her Loreley’\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA  classy BMW, booked by Yuan Ming in London, was waiting for us on  our arrival  in Cologne airport.

The Punch Archie and I materialised in a market place in Thurii – an Athenian colony during the fifth century BCE. It was a sunny late spring day. Sicily was warm but the light breeze made the heat bearable. Recalling his own days in Syracuse, Archie looked around him with satisfaction. He felt at home.\nA tall man, with a balding head and long beard, was surrounded by a group of eager listeners. He was telling them details of the wars between Persia and Greece, referring to the courage of the Spartans at the Thermopylae and the heroics of the Greek navy in Salamis. His voice fell and rose as he talked; and members of the audience applauded whenever he narrated the end of an event.\nHe then proceeded to tell them about the wonders of Egypt, of the Eastern European realm (currently Ukraine) and, to my surprise, of North Africa. He spent some twenty minutes on the history of Babylon and even mentioned the Assyrians. Had he really been to that part of the ancient world?\nWhen the session was over Herodotus turned to Archie and me with patent curiosity. Did he sense that neither of us was flesh and blood?\n“And who are you two?” he wanted to know.\n“I am Archimedes, man of Syracuse, and this here is my friend Peter’le.”\n“From where are you heading?”\n“From a haven in purgatory. Lord Pan transported us back in time so that Peter’le would be able to keep his rendezvous with you.”\n“Lord Pan?” Herodotus let his surprise show.\n“You may have heard of him,” countered Archie sarcastically, having been stung to the quick because Herodotus did not recognise his name. Odd to say, Archie ignored the fact that Herodotus had lived some two hundred years before himself.\n“I know who he is; and you are a rude fellow. Didn’t your mother teach you manners?”\n“She told me that yokels like you ought to be hit before they can turn on innocent beings. And as to rudeness: you don’t have a monopoly,” retorted an incensed Archie.\n“Gentlemen, gentlemen,” I interceded. “Both of you are amongst the greatest heralds of Greek culture. You shouldn’t to snarl at one another like hungry wolves. How could Herodotus have heard your name, Archie? He lived long before you!”\nTo calm my enraged friend further, I gave him a biographical sketch of the great historian. Having been expelled from Halicarnassus – his birthplace – by a tyrant, Herodotus had travelled widely all over the world. He tried to settle in Athens, and accepted its traditions and cultural outlook. Still, at his time citizenship was not granted to foreigners. So, Herodotus volunteered to move to Thurii, one of Athens first colonies in Sicily. While residing there he wrote his history of the Persian wars, known as The Histories. When Archie nodded, I went on to discuss the nature of the tome.\n“Well put. But who is he?” Herodotus asked, pointing his finger at Archie.\n“The greatest Greek mathematician.”\n“Oh, the sort of chap who tells schoolchildren that 2 + 2 is 4?”\n“Even you can do this, you nincompoop!” yelled Archie.\n“What a hot temper,” grinned Herodotus. “Well, if you can’t even teach, what do you do for a living?”\n“I have worked out many puzzles,” retorted Archie. “For instance, I can calculate the measures of a hyperbola and a parabola. Can you do this?”\n“Of course not. And, tell me, you bumpkin: what would I do with the answer? What use would it be to me or any other sensible man?”\n“It might improve your confused mind,” summed up Archie.\n“But can your calculations be of practical use to anybody?”\n“Of course they can. I worked out a system of mirrors that should have put the Roman Navy on fire when it attacked Syracuse.”\n“And did your strategy save your town?” Herodotus wanted to know.\n“It didn’t,” admitted Archie sadly. “The Roman admiral changed the formation of his ships.”\n“So, your calculations were useless,” pointed out Herodotus, smirking gleefully.\n“Gentlemen, gentlemen,” I stepped in again. “I see no reason for discord. Archie is a conceptualist and you, Herodotus, are a pragmatist.”\n“But who are you? And why don’t you mind your own business?” bellowed Herodotus, reminding me that, in real life, an objective observer frequently incurred the two combatants’ wrath.\n“Should I perhaps attend to my task straightaway?” I asked innocently.\n“You might as well,” prompted Archie. “Why waste time?”\nHerodotus nodded. Without further ado I stepped forward and punched him. For just a second he clung to a stool but then toppled over with a scream. Instantly, Archie and I stepped over and helped him back to his feet. Archie, to my delight, brushed Herodotus’ apparel and spoke to him soothingly.\n2. Herodotos’ Writings Analysed For a few moments Herodotus remained speechless. Then, as he recovered his voice, he addressed me firmly: “Are you a nut? To start with you are ‘Mr Nice’. You try to make peace between Archie and me. I even begin to think you may be alright. And then, for no reason, you punch me. Are you out of your mind or did you flush it down this morning?”\n“Isn’t that an anachronism? I didn’t think you primitives had flush toilets,” I averred.\n“We didn’t,” conceded Archie. “But we were not ‘primitives’!”\n“This time Archie is right,” supplanted Herodotus. “We are Greeks. The rest of the world is barbarian and hence primitive. Still, you better tell me what twist of mind motivated your cowardly assault on an old man!”\n“It’s my mission!”\n“What mission?”\nHerodotus’ eyes opened wide when I explained to him the nature of my assignment. He then wanted to know what was Archie’s role. He looked relieved when I explained Archie was a mere observer. He had no mandate to punch anyone.\nI thought all was settled when Archie raised the telling point. He wanted to know why I considered Herodotus one of the greatest men in human history. Wasn’t a great mathematician superior to a mere historian? A mathematician was a Master of Science and a prince of the arts. A historian, in contrast, was a teller of stories, a base chronicler.\nHe was appeased when I explained that Herodotus was not just ‘some historian’. He was the ‘Father of History’. True, the Bible and the Iliad related events. They even included some pedigrees. Herodotus, though, was the first person to examine the causes and effects of sociological and political developments. To discern the causes of the war between Persia and Greece, he investigated relevant histories and events and explained the connections between them. He was not a mere narrator. For this reason, Herodotus occupied a special place in human history. All later historians – even men of genius like Thucydides and Polibius – played a secondary role. They advanced the new science but did not form disciplines.\n“But didn’t Herodotus tell us fairy tales about ‘gold digging, giant ants’ and remarkable marmots?”\n“So he did. And he told us some strange tales about a Persian monarch. According to Herodotus, Xerxes lashed the Hellespont with iron chains because a storm damaged the crossing fleet – a stupid act to attribute to a fine military leader who coordinated the advance of his forces by sea and on land. Worse than this – Herodotus told us strange tales about countries he may have never visited.”\n“He is the ‘Father of all Lies’,” pointed out Archie. “And you, Peter’le, have elevated him to a pedestal. He lacks the integrity and objectivity of a pure scientist.”\n“But I never claimed to be a scientist,” protested Herodotus. “I am a logios – a teller of remote events. I must embellish my narrations with anecdotes and stories bound to appeal to my audience. If I don’t, they may walk out on me; and I won’t earn a living. And, you know, I always distinguished between what I was told and what I thought had actually taken place. I may have been fooled: but I am not a knave!”\n“That’s why history respected him, Archie. Herodotus may have erred on many occasions but he gives you a sound and, yes, analytical reconstruction of political conflicts and of wars. I do admire his work. True, Thucydides is great. But isn’t he sometimes vague and boring?”\n“Thanks for your support, Mr Nose-Puncher. But please tell me about later loggie.\nWhose lead did they follow?”\n“They pretended to follow Thucydides’ objectivity but usually were much more biased than you. When I read your Histories, I wasn’t certain who was your hero. When I read Lord Macaulay’s History of England, I realised he worshipped William of Orange. I was aghast when I found out from other records that, far from standing by the helm of his lead ship, William was sucking a lemon in his cabin, green with seasickness. And the Japanese official records conveniently forget all about the massacre of the population of Nanjing. ‘Objectivity’ is easy to preach but hard to attain.”\n“So it is,” conceded Archie. “So, all in all, you have chosen well.”\n“Except that my nose is painful,” grumbled Herodotus.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novels/nose-puncher/part-4/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e(484 – 425 BCE)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"1-the-punch\"\u003e1.

My objectives were to revisit the past and to crystallize my beliefs in the supernatural. Right after my arrival in London I proceeded to Oxford.\nFeeling exhausted, I sank into the comfortable armchair in the small house I had rented for three months. Its location – off Walton Street near the heart of Oxford – was excellent. A five minutes walk would take me to St. Giles Road and Carfax. The Bodleian library’s reading rooms, which I had come to revisit and use, were readily accessible from there. Yet another advantage was the reasonable rent. Although I had amassed wealth over the years, I had remained parsimonious.\nOn all accounts, I should have congratulated myself on a job well done. But a feeling of unease overcame me as soon as I had made myself at home. The fine furniture, sparkling bathroom and modern kitchenette failed to relieve my inner tension. My choice of the abode had not been made freely but under an unexplainable compulsion. Something, I knew, was amiss.\nSuddenly, I felt a nudge. Having experienced it often before, I realised that the sequence of events had been dictated by my mentor. Generally, Theophil was not an interventionist; from times immemorial he had kept aloof though watchful. To aid his vigil, he had elected, generation after generation, a friend or two in our dimension. I was the latest. He had revealed himself to me, in full regalia, some two decades earlier in an antiques shop off Kensington Church Street in London. Since then, we communicated regularly. In a sense he was always within reach.\n“You directed me to this cosy house, Maestro!”\n“I am not an interventionist, Peter’le. I’ve told you this again and again!”\n“So you say. Still, I felt something like a nudge before I decided to take the house.”\n“I induced you to pause and think; the choice was yours!”\n“Very well, then. But what’s so special about this house. I could have taken a room in the Old Parsonage or in Queen Elizabeth House. Would have been even cheaper; and no need to cook.”\n“True. But this house is a good base!”\n“For what?”\n“For our exploratory trips into the past. I want you to meet previous occupants of this house! These meetings will help you to complete the records we have been discussing earlier on.”\n“When was this house built?”\n“There was a house here more than two hundred years ago. But it had been pulled down and rebuilt several times. I want you to see occupants you can relate to. If I took you back to the 18th century, you might not cope: no cars, no electricity and – you know – no gas.”\nTheophil had taken me into the past on previous occasions. To him the past, the present and the future were not delineated by clear boundaries. He dwelt in a different dimension: invisible and incomprehensible. Theophil could, of course, watch any event in our three-dimensional universe from his vantage point. Still, to ease communications he had often assumed a form visible to mankind.\nI was familiar with two images. One was Peppi’s: my father’s friend who had saved my family during the Holocaust and who had, many years later, become my own friend. The other image I knew was the traditional appearance of the being called the Archfiend. When I saw him in this shape for the first time I was overcome by terror. It took me an effort to quench it. By now I had come to like that image, especially as I knew that this too was a costume or perhaps a satire.\n“I am still in the dark, Theophil. If you choose, you can help me travel in time from any spot. So why the need for a ‘base’?”\n“Largely psychological. It will be good for you to recall that, when each trip is over, you are to come back to the new version of the very place we visited. Well, let us start”.\nA woman was holding a man in her arms. It was a deep, intimate, embrace. For just a while it lasted. Then it was over; but both kept smiling. He continued to pet her. She was fondling him.\n“Name the experience,” demanded Theophil.\n“Bliss, I think.”\n“Their nuptials. But now have a good look at the house.”\n“It looks similar yet very different. There is no electricity; just a kerosene lamp. Also, there are more rooms but they are cubby holes; and the walls are more solid; the windows much smaller; and the open fireplace is quaint!”\n“Excellent means for heating the space above the chimney,” he grinned. “As yet, no central heating in England.”\n“The furniture and furnishings are appalling and there is no bathroom.”\n“It’s an outhouse. When they are sick, or when it snows, they use a chamber pot!”\nGrinning inwardly, I recalled how my landlady told me, in 1959, that her in-house bathroom had been the first to be installed in Newton Road. And she had told me that in her younger days nobody in the street had ‘hot and cold running’.\n“To which era have you conveyed me?” I asked my pilot.\n“1918; just after the Armistice!”\n“Primitive,” I muttered.\n“In the eyes of a man of your generation. Care to see the 18th century house? It was quaint but smoky! The owners were pig farmers!”\n“But surely, the occupants must have raised families?”\n“My dear Peter’le: the object of the creation …\n“ … evolution?” I interceded.\n“No need to quibble, Peter’le. But – be this as it may – the object is ‘procreate and multiply’.”\n“So, they knew all about it!”\n“From times immemorial. Care to see Mount Carmel man and his Missis?”\n“No thank you. I am not a peeping tom!”\n“Very well, then. But have a good look at our lovebirds the day after.”\n“Sure. But Theophil: didn’t they take a honey moon?”\n“They had no money. You are viewing the post-war era. The young generation was ravaged by the mayhem in the trenches. Jack and Mary were lucky to have a place of their own. The College sought to reward Jack for his services as Chief Steward. They let him use one of their properties. But for this lucky break, Jack and Mary would have had to share a house with others.”\nMary held the door open for Jack, who was wearing a suit and tie. He kissed her cheek before he hopped onto his bicycle. To my surprise, the road was asphalted.\n“They had to maintain smooth, asphalt surfaced, roads for their bicycles,” explained Theophil. “Mass produced cars were developed later. In 1918 cars were rare: status symbols associated with wealth. Most cars were chauffeur driven.”\nJack rode his bike to a college. On the way, a self-propelled bus – known as an autobus – overtook him. It was a double decker, reminiscent of a horse pulled omnibus or a postal carriage. Its upper deck was uncovered.\nAs Jack rode through the College’s gate, the porter smiled at him familiarly. Jack nodded and walked briskly to the dining area.\n“Were many working class people employed by the colleges?”\n“The colleges were the main work providers in those days,” affirmed Theophil.\nJack inspected the kitchen, peered into the pots, tasted the soup and then smiled with satisfaction. Later, he carved the roast and supervised the heaping of potatoes and vegetables on plates. Adroitly, he added slices of the carved meat and, judiciously, ladled out the gravy.\n“No Yorkshire pudding?” I complained.\n“Not for a college lunch on a regular day, my dear Peter’le. If you like, I’ll add some to your plate!”\n“Am I lunching in?” I asked bewildered.\n“Incognito: the invisible guest.”\n“But what is the object, cher ami? Why don’t I associate with them?”\n“They’ll summon the college priest for an exorcism,” he chuckled. “We can do without such nonsense. But as regards the object: please watch Jack carefully. What does he feel? You know I can read his mind; but not his emotions. They are a blur! As I have told you repeatedly, I have no emotions.”\n“You’ve mixed too long with us humans to have retained your ‘immunity’.”\n“We’ll have to agree to disagree. So don’t you complain if one day I don’t step in to help you. I am Satan; not a guardian angel!”\n“Point taken – my friend,” I insisted on having the last word.\nIn the early days of our friendship, I would have feared tackling him in such manner. Theophil had the means and the power to destroy our entire three-dimensional universe. Initially, this knowledge invoked my fear of his wrath. But, as our routes continued to intertwine, I realised my apprehension was unfounded. The constant observation of our universe was the task my friend had set for himself. If our universe ceased, Theophil’s existence – whatever it might be – would lose its focus. He was not going to cut the branch on which – intellectually – he was sitting. I, too, was a requisite dictated by his task. All in all, I was his tool: his physical extension into an alien dimension. I had no reason to fear him.\nTheophil read my thoughts with usual ease. “You see, Peter’le, perhaps symbiosis is a more appropriate word than ‘friendship’?”\n“Maybe,” I gave in, “but I don’t like to think of it this way. I’ve become too fond of you!”\nBoth of us were now observing Jack. Theophil kept reading his thoughts. I tried to gauge his feelings. To my amazement, no trace was left of the happiness I had noted on the previous evening. Jack did not recall it. He felt at home with the menial work he was doing. Mary and his home were far removed.\n“Something doesn’t add up, Theophil,” I said when I completed my probe.\n“Explain?”\nWhen I had completed my analysis, Theophil confirmed that Jack’s thoughts, too, centred on his occupation. His wife and home were not reflected.\n“Isn’t that odd?” I asked.\n“What does it suggest to you?” he replied quizzically.\n“Lack of commitment?”\n“Lack of interest, rather. I’m not sure it is an odd phenomenon! Well, let us then observe later developments.”\nMary had just given birth to a baby boy. Having had a painful and difficult delivery, she looked pale and withdrawn. Staring fixedly in front of her, she did not sit up to admire the flowers Jack had placed in a vase on her bedside table. He, in turn, looked worried and worn out. Had he remained awake during her labour?\n“I’m not going through this again, Jack: It was awful!”\nDespite Jack’s patent sympathy and concern, he had resented Mary’s words. Sensing he had intended to express the same sentiment, I was puzzled by his reaction.\n“Perhaps he wanted to have a say?” observed Theophil.\nThe kaleidoscope moved onward in time. A small boy, some five years of age, was playing in the unfenced front garden. Mary concentrated on her needle work. I liked her embroidery.\nThe brief glimpse I had of Jack, showed him smiling with satisfaction. He was, again, carving a roast in his College. His heart was far removed from his home as his eye roved in the direction of an attractive kitchen maid, looking prim in her attire.\nThe next image showed the same boy – some five years later – lying istless on the ground. Mary was bending over him but her attempt to rouse him was in vain. As she continued to cry, Jack came rushing to the scene, dishevelled and shivering in his shirt sleeves.\n“What happened?” I asked my guide.\n“The boy was knocked down by a bike. His neck was broken in the fall. The rider did not stop! Have a good look at Jack and Mary!”\n“How ghastly,” I said feebly after probing. “He resents her carelessness. Why didn’t she look after the boy. Why couldn’t she put her blasted needle work aside for a while.”\n“And she?” asked Theophil.\n“She blames him for his parsimony. She had told him they needed a fence; but he thought the cost ought to be borne by the College.”\nThe next screen showed Jack’s dismissal. He had been drinking heavily and often turned up unfit for work. His next job was in a restaurant in a red brick town. Later, they moved to London, where he worked in a pub. He had lost weight, looked forlorn and was ageing rapidly. The real shock came when I glimpsed at Mary. She had never been an elegant dresser. Nevertheless, she used to be tidy and reasonably well groomed. To my disappointment, this image of a good housewife had gone. She was unkempt and looked neglected.\nI next witnessed Jack’s death. He had suffered a stroke as he got up in the morning. Mary, who was sobbing, looked frightened. Her next image – a few years later in London – displayed an old, broken, hag. She bore little resemblance to the once presentable even if plain Jane I had seen earlier on.\n“She is hungry, cold and miserable. She sees no point in going on,” I told Theophil.\n“It explains the next scene, which I’d rather not show you.”\n“Was she left penniless?”\n“No,” advised Theophil. “He left her enough for a modest living. But she had no head for affairs. It was all gone in no time!”\n“What a sad ending,” I said in a trembling voice. “But why, Theophil; why?”\n“Let’s go back to the start,” he suggested.\nWe were back in Oxford of days gone by. Young Jack and Mary were singing in a church choir. A pianist accompanied the group as they sang hymns. Jack was stealing glances at Mary. She was aware of his interest. The next screens showed them going to the cinema, sharing a meal in a modest eatery and walking together to church. Jack’s feelings manifested desire and anticipation. She was responsive. I could tell that both were shy and, as yet, not on familiar terms.\nI then watched him proposing. He was eager; she tried to hide her feeling of victory. Their church wedding was plain, followed by a modest dinner with a few friends and relatives. My next image of them was the very first I had observed on my time-trip. They were still embracing one another but their moment was over.\n“Watch them carefully,” requested Theophil. “What do you sense?”\n“Both are disappointed and Jack is disillusioned.”\n“What do you make of it?” he wanted to know.\n“Great expectations not coming true,” I mused. “They didn’t get what they hoped for.”\n“Both of them?” he asked.\n“Mary is not disillusioned. Perhaps she didn’t expect that much!”\n“I think you are right,” he conceded.\n“So, the sad end is an outcome of a poor beginning. Chance?”\n“One element, undoubtedly. Any other?”\nIt was a turning point. I needed his guidance. Holding my hand out, I waited for the nudge. With Theophil’s perception added to my own, I spotted the answer readily. I had, actually, guessed it for years.\n“Theophil, Jack and Mary would have come to a sad end even if the boy had recovered; wouldn’t they?”\n“The boy might have kept them together. Children are good glue. But the rot would have set in when he left home. Still, Jack might not have become a drunk.”\n“I have not encountered many happy marriages.”\n“Ditto! And, as you mutter, I’ve had plenty of time to observe!”\n“I believe I’ve now identified the reason for unhappy marriages.”\n“Please articulate!”\n“Regardless of whether He ‘created’ our Universe or was the ‘prime mover’ of evolution, there was a need to look for a plan: a sort of DNA plan. Did He then make some miscalculation when he ‘triggered off’ a three-dimensional Universe which is alien to him.”\n“A miscalculation respecting the physics?” he persisted.\n“He got this right. But he made a slip when it came to the psyche.”\nTheophil approbated. “Which distinguishes Homo Sapiens from other animals”\nWhen I looked around me, I was back in my rented abode in my own era. A magnificent early Meissen chocolate pot and a handsome beaker in a trembleuse saucer materialised on the dining table. The smell was delicious.\n“I’m not allowed to take sugar,” I reminded him.\n“I’ll fix it for you this time. So, enjoy it.”\n“Thanks for the trip and thanks for these magnificent pieces. Still, how will this trip and the insights based on it help me with the task we have agreed on?”\n“Wait and see!”\nThree Characters For ten days, following my trip to 1918, I worked in the library like a beaver. Luck, though, was with me. On several occasions an article, textbook or law report fell open at the very page I was searching for. When I returned home after completing my first rough draft, I felt the familiar nudge.\n“Today I’m taking you to 1932,” he advised as he materialised in front of me.\n“Theophil,” I wanted to know, “don’t you ever assume the form of a woman?”\n“Not when I am dealing with a heterosexual man,” he observed laconically.\n“I understand why,” I assured him.\nThe house had been refurbished. The partitions between the sitting room and the bedroom had been knocked down. The new large sitting room was more tastefully furnished than in the days of Jack and Mary. An old-fashioned gramophone adorned it and the light fittings showed that electricity had arrived. The room was comfortable without being grand or pretentious. The man sitting on the sofa was in his late forties, fat and flabby. The bottle and glass in front of him left no doubt about his state of mind. His eyes, bloodshot and weary, were staring fixedly at an unseen object in the distance. His face was contorted.\n“Jealousy?” I asked my guide.\n“Care to probe?”\nThe emotions of this new occupier – Richard Smith – centred on his friend. Willie had promised to come home directly after work but was two hours late. Richard – known to his friends as Dick – suspected Willie was out with a woman. His contorted face reflected the intensity of his dismay.\n“I don’t get it, Theophil. His jealousy is triggered by Willie’s involvement with a woman. He is repeating to himself: ‘If I’m not good enough why doesn’t he see another man.’ Surely, even in this scenario, Willie would be ‘unfaithful’? So where is the difference?”\n“Why not ask Dick?”\n“How? He doesn’t know we are watching him.”\n“Care to materialise in front of his eyes?”\nDick’s bloodshot eyes stared at me. He wiped them like a man facing a mirage. He then pinched his arm. At long last he said: “Are you here or am I seeing things?”\n“But Dick: if you ‘see’ things won’t you also ‘hear’ them? And let me assure you: I am here right in front of you!”\n“I get it,” he grunted. “But who are you and how did you get in? Through the chimney?”\n“My name is Peter Berger. And I did not use the chimney. My pilot let me materialise me in front of you!”\n“You are a foreigner. Still, you speak good English! From where did you emerge?”\n“From the future; I rented this very place in 2006!”\n“You expect me to believe such drivel. You some sort of nut?”\n“Believe it or not. And no: I’m not a nut. I’m a time traveller.”\n“Blimey,” he said and took a stiff gulp from the mug in front of him.\n“You are not an Irishman by chance?” I enquired, startled by the expression.\n“God forbid; but I lived in Dublin for a while: before I came to this mausoleum.”\n“But then, why did you leave Dublin?\n“I met a nice Oxford chap in a pub. So, I went with him to this damned place!”\n“What’s so terrible about Oxford? I lived here from 1959 to 1961; it’s quite OK!”\n“It stinks. And here’s where I met that bloody Willie.”\nIt was my turn to stare at him. Dick’s feelings were in tandem with his words. He needed Willie. At the very same time, he resented Willie’s hold over him and had no illusions about his friend’s motives and nature.\n“If he’s so bloody, why don’t you tell him to get lost?”\n“Compulsion, Berger: don’t you know what it means?”\n“I do. But look here: with some resolve you can set yourself free?”\n“Have you ever managed to do so?”\n“Not directly, Dick. But I managed to get some females to jilt me!”\n“If that’s what you wanted, why didn’t you simply kick them out?”\n“Cowardice … and confusion!”\n“They sound familiar,” he said with a shrug. “Here, have a drink!”\n“Sorry, Dick, the doctor has forbidden any alcohol.”\nHe looked startled. It seemed best to tell him I suffered from Hepatitis C and Diabetes. He was familiar with the latter but, of course, had not heard of the former. Still, he gathered it was some liver complaint. Following a few moments of reflection, he suggested the Randolph Bar. He could have a drink and I could get black coffee or a tea. He believed they had saccharin.\nElectricity was by then used for street lighting. The roads were better and their surfaces smoother. Cars had become common and the buses looked similar to those I had seen in the fifties. As we proceeded, I was amused by the old houses in St. Giles, which had later been replaced by Queen Elizabeth House. When I asked about concerts and shows, Dick advised a chamber orchestra was playing in the Sheldonian. He added that they had a few cinemas. Further, a Shakespeare comedy was performed by a group of amateurs in New College.\nThe Randolph looked as it had in 1959. It was marked by its ugly and plain architecture: a masterpiece of bombastic pomp. The bar, too, was familiar as were the neatly dressed waiters. Dick grinned appreciatively as he sipped the beverage in front of him. I enjoyed the strongly brewed black coffee. The appetising snacks placed in front of us were soon gone. For a while, I thought I was back in 1959. Then, as we had a second round, I started to worry about the bill. Dick, I realised, was living from hand to mouth.\n“Dick: today it’s my treat. But would they accept my credit card?”\n“Your ‘what’?”\nDick stared with amazement at the Visa card I took out of my wallet. He listened attentively to my description of its use and admired my ATM card. He appreciated the advantage of using a dispensing machine to get money from the bank.\n“So, you don’t have to queue up to present your cash cheque over the counter every week?”\n“Precisely,” I told him, “I can use an ATM in any part of town and even in some cities overseas.”\n“And how does the bank keep its accounts?”\n“It’s all done by computer. And – just in case any data is lost – the bank has a second copy, called a ‘back up’.”\nDick was out of his depths. The nature of computers and their use in industry had to be explained to him. When I finished my basic introduction, he pointed out that, when a bank had such a ‘computer system’, it could get rid of its incompetent personnel. As Assistant Branch Manager of a local bank, he appreciated the opportunity. Still, he sensed that such automation could, in due course, exacerbate the unemployment faced in his days in many industries. He knew that generally the machine threatened the labour force. He had studied the history of the industrial revolution.\n“Can I use these banknotes?” I asked, showing him the pound sterling notes in my wallet.\n“I haven’t seen anything like them.”\n“How about these?” I asked as another roll appeared in my wallet.\n“These are OK,” he confirmed, “and that’s a lot of money.”\n“Let’s use it, then” I told him. “And you keep what’s left when I go home.”\n“Thanks, but you know: that’s more than a year’s salary.”\nI had another coffee and Dick ordered three stiff whiskeys. His face became flushed and, every now and then, he glanced nervously and surreptitiously at his watch. Realising what was on his mind, I suggested he ring home.\n“Awkward when you use their telephone,” he told me.\n“I wish I could lend you my handphone.”\n“And what’s that?”\nDick did not try to conceal his amazement when my handphone materialised in front of us. It took me a while to explain the nature and the use of a cellular phone. In the event, the idea of a person carrying a telephone with him, day in day out, amused Dick. The owner would, then, be available regardless of where he was at the time of the call.\n“Provided there is a network connection. You can’t be reached if you are out of bounds or if you switch the instrument off.”\n“This means that you have the option: you don’t have to take incoming calls.”\n“Precisely,” I told Dick and, having had a word with Theophil, added: “Come, give it a try. My friend will provide a network connection this time.”\nWillie answered instantly. He must have been sitting next to the receiver. He had wondered where Jack had gone and could not understand why he was being kept waiting. True, he himself had been held up; but that was no excuse for Dick’s behaviour. Willie’s aggressive complaints, accompanied by demands for money, went on for a few minutes. Before long Dick was dismayed and flabbergasted. In a broken voice, he promised to be back in no time.\n“Dick,” I tried to open his eyes, “the chap is preying on you; he is taking you for a ride. I understand he has a hold over you. But he’ll bleed you white before he’s done.”\n“I know,” lamented Dick; “but I can’t break his hold.”\n“And there’s one more thing I can’t understand. If Willie had been out with another fellow, you’d shrug your shoulders and mutter ‘live and let live’. Why does it matter if he’s with a woman? The very thought gets you berserk!”\n“Seeing a woman means he doesn’t give a damn about our … friendship.”\nBefore long we were back in the house. As I had suspected, Willie was in his late twenties or early thirties. Neatly groomed and well dressed, with a smart sheepskin and shining shoes, his appearance contrasted sharply with Dick’s slovenly and poor attire.\n“Did you get me the dough?” he asked aggressively, ignoring my presence.\nDick handed him one of the notes I had given him. “And here’s another for keeping you waiting.”\n“Don’t you do it again,” Willie spoke contemptuously. “And I’m off for a snack.”\nAs he spoke, I probed Dick’s emotions. His desire and commitment mingled with a deep loathing. He was aware Willie was ruining him and did not care for him. But for the hold Willie exercised over him, Dick would be glad to see the last of him.\n“Want to step in his aid?” asked Theophil.\n“How?” I asked.\n“Provoke Willie. Dick cannot stand violence. If Willie loses his cool, Dick might assume the resolve to boot him out!”\n“Hello, Willie,” I said.\n“And who are you, you ugly mug?”\n“Name is Peter Berger; and you Willie – why don’t you look into the mirror?”\n“Why on earth should I, you idiot?”\n“To see real ugliness!”\n“You’re talking to me?” he yelled.\n“I am, indeed, you half-wit!”\n“Next thing you’d call me names!” he shouted.\n“Difficult choice: swine, scum, bloodsucker and louse come to mind; and a few others!”\nWillie’s fist went through my image and slammed into the door frame. Losing his balance, he crashed into the wall. When he recovered, his nose was bleeding and he was clutching his wrist painfully.\n“Lost your balance? Poor Willie!” I taunted him, wondering whether he was a professional boxer or a mere street hoodlum.\n“You better watch your own balance,” he yelled. He was about to ram an empty mug at me, when, using my voice, Theophil warned: “You better cool down, Willie. If you throw this mug, it’ll land straight on your own face!”\n“Chickened away?” I chuckled, as Willie’s arm dropped.\n“Why don’t you throw him out?” Willie wailed as he turned to Dick.\n“It’s not him I want to boot out!” Dick responded.\nShocked and terrified, Willie rushed out into the street. Dick, in turn, went over to the table and took a gulp from the open bottle.\nAdroitly, Theophil manoeuvred me to the nearest street corner. Trying hard to appear unruffled, Willie was talking to a woman, who must have been waiting for him. Blossoming in her late thirties, she was too tall and heavy set to be attractive. But I could sense her vitality and strength. A probe confirmed she was not enamoured of Willie. Actually, she disliked him.\n“Here take one of these, Liz,” he told her as he produced the two notes he got from Dick. “I’m off to ‘emergency’ at the Radcliffe. I’ve injured my wrist.”\n“What on earth happened?” she feigned concern.\n“I slipped. And I’m through with him. I’ve had enough.”\n“Want me to come with you?”\n“You better go home; have a bite to eat on the way. I’ll be back as soon as I can.”\nFor just a moment she reflected. “I think I’ll walk over to Jane’s. I’ll stay with her if it gets too late.”\nAs soon as Willie was out of sight, Liz walked to the very door from which Willie had emerged. For a few seconds she hesitated. Then, resolutely, she knocked.\n“Who’s there?” I heard Dick startled voice.\n“It’s me, Dick – Liz – open up.”\n“What a night,” said Dick as he opened the door. “To start with, some time traveller calls on me. Then I’ve a fight with my boyfriend and boot him out. And then, it’s my separated wife. What a night!”\n“Don’t you worry,” she assured him as she stepped in and closed the door. “I’m not after a reconciliation. It’s been over for two years. I’ve come to bring you back some of your money. Here – that’s what Willie gave me.”\n“Willie? What on earth do you have to do with this … chap?”\n“I’ve been seeing him for some time.”\n“Surely, not that … crap; you can’t be in love with him!”\n“Of course not. But I wanted to get you out of his clutches.”\nLiz looked around her. Her eye rested disapprovingly on the half empty bottle and the glass on the table. She then grinned as she looked at the smears of blood on the wall and door frame.\n“So that’s where Willie slipped?”\n“Is that what he told you?” chuckled Dick.\n“What happened?”\n“He wanted to hit that time traveller but slammed into the door!”\n“What’s this nonsense about a time traveller? Are you well, Dick?”\n“Of course,” he rebuked.\n“You haven’t been seeing things?”\n“No, Liz, I haven’t! And look, here’s what he gave me!”\nLiz’s eyes opened wide when she saw the money. Having counted the notes, she observed it was nearly enough to buy a large house in Iffley. She wanted to provide a haven for women escaping from brutal husbands or oppressive parents. A mid-way house would provide a shelter whilst they decided how to start afresh.\n“Have it,” Dick told her. “We might as well put it to good use.”\n“It’s about 300 quid short,” she said sadly.\nShe looked astounded as the sheaf in front of her swelled. Having counted the notes again, she affirmed it was now more than enough. Then, still looking bewildered, she wondered whether she herself had started to see things.\n“No, Liz,” Dick told her, “I too saw them ‘multiplying?”\n“Joint hallucinations?” she asked anxiously.\n“No, Liz; amazing as they are: the facts are clear! You better take the money with you.”\n“Don’t you want to keep some, in the very least?”\n“I’ll keep 10 quid: for drinking money.”\nLiz looked at him sadly. Once again, I sensed her affection for him. Saddened by his steady decline, she knew he had long passed the point of no return. All the same, she made her last attempt.\n“It’s never too late to make a new start. Why don’t you pull yourself together and make one last effort. You are killing yourself. That stuff’s poison; and you can’t take it.”\n“I know. But, Liz, do you think I wanted to be like that? Don’t you think I wanted to be a good husband; have a family and a delightful home. Do you think I had a choice?”\n“I don’t know, Dick. I don’t know. I too tried. How do you think I felt when we were sitting together – in a restaurant or a party – and you kept stealing glances not at other women but at men? I’m a normal woman, Dick.”\n“I know. And you, too, have your needs. Yes, I know: and you did your best. What a pity I was made my way.”\n“Don’t you think everyone has a cross to bear?”\n“Perhaps; but mine was – still is – an unfair load to carry!”\nLiz did not reply. As she made ready to go, Dick urged her not to return to her home that evening. She could use his spare room. As I expected, she declined. A friend, whom she had helped through with her divorce, had asked her to come and stay if the need arose. She lived just around the corner.\n“You better take this with you,” Dick pointed at the pile of notes.\n“I don’t dare to carry so much money with me. Can I come and take it tomorrow?”\n“I’ll deposit it in the old bank account. It’s still in joint names. You can take it whenever you want.”\nShe looked at him sadly as she departed. As soon as she was gone, Dick seized the bottle. Taking in his pallor, I knew he would be gone before long. Theophil’s shrug affirmed my prognosis. I, in turn, had a question to raise.\n“Theophil, I do believe that people are never saints or monsters. They come in different shades: Dick is light grey.”\n“I agree.”\n“How about Willie? Where is his bright side?”\n“How was he with Liz?”\n“Coming to think of it, he was OK. Didn’t let her come with him to ‘emergency’: quite considerate, I think.”\n“Let’s have a look at him in a different scenario,” he suggested.\nWillie was sitting by a low table in an old-fashioned sitting room on the outskirts of Reading. His right wrist was in a cast but his face did not display discomfort or pain. As he took the cup of tea with his left hand, his expression radiated warmth and happiness.\n“Tell me again how this happened,” asked his aging mother with concern.\n“I just slipped, Mom, and fractured my wrist when I broke my fall. It’s just a trifle; it’ll be alright next time I come over!”\n“But you better be careful, Willie. Fractures take a long time to heal.”\n“I know. It’s just bad luck; and I was clumsy. Don’t you worry; it won’t happen again.”\n“She thinks Willie is a travelling salesman,” advised Theophil. “And she is proud of him. Her husband left her a tidy nest egg. Willie makes sure she has enough to spread jam on her bread and butter. Well, what do you say now?”\n“I get your point. This is a different Willie: I like him.”\n“You see,” he approbated.\n“The human soul – the psyche – is complex and fragile, isn’t it?” I asked as we returned to my era.\n“It is,” he said emphatically. “Read this carefully; it will tell you all about it.”\nAs he vanished a neatly produced book materialised in front of me, entitled The Psyche by Peter Berger and S. Theophil. Its back revealed that it was published in 2028.\n“It’s an advance copy,” my friend chuckled. “But you must see the importance of this episode. Some tasks – like saving a lost soul – are futile. You, Peter’le, ought to know. You’ll come back to this very point when you try to carry out the main task imposed on you.\nA Dedicated Author My third trip into the past took place some ten days after I had returned from 1932. By then I had recovered from my harassing experience with Dick, Willie and Liz.\nIn most regards, Oxford of 1948 looked as it did ten years later, when I arrived there as a post graduate student. Even the college façades looked the same and the double decker buses appeared familiar. Walking invisibly down Cornmarket, Theophil and I observed the flow of people. Their clothes were familiar and the traffic was as heavy as it used to be by the end of the next decade.\nThe occupant of the house was sitting by her desk and bashing her portable typewriter steadily and incessantly. Her fingers hit the keys rhythmically and unerringly with the lines accumulating speedily on the page she was typing. The house was well furnished and decorated but it needed the attention of a maid.\nA mug of coffee placed on the desk was no longer steaming. The occupant had not taken a sip for hours. She was too absorbed in her immediate task. I noted, further, she was unkempt, poorly groomed and appeared to have dressed without glancing into the mirror. Her sweater and slacks were of good quality but would have benefited from washing and pressing.\n“What is she typing, Theophil, a research report?”\n“Have a look,” he responded. The title page of the work read: “Bright Tiger: a Novel by Barbara Brown”.\n“I haven’t heard of her, Theophil.”\n“Nobody has,” he advised and produced from one of the drawers in her desk a folder of letters of rejection sent by different publishing houses. Some advised that her work did not “fit into our mainstream”, others suggested the work would not be of the type popular with their readers and others still were curt refusals.\n“Care to read her novels?” asked Theophil and pointed to a shelf of typescripts. The were altogether twelve bundles.\n“It would take me months to read them,” I faltered.\n“I’ll let you use my reading speed,” he volunteered.\n“She is brilliant,” I told him some twenty minutes later. “Why on earth do they keep rejecting her books? They are well above standard: sparkling style; excellent dialogue; inordinately rich vocabulary and exciting plots.”\n“She just sends the manuscripts to publishing houses. She has no connections, no backer and no PR or skill in handling people. Also, she has no luck”.\nWhat kept Barbara Brown going, I mused? She did not write for money. With her excellent style and writing skills she could have made a handsome income from writing for magazines with a literary or political bent. Obviously, she was not a penny a liner. The furniture, furnishings and, in particular, the modern and well-fitted kitchen showed she was not poor. Why did she not devote a few hours per day to her writings and pursue a hobby or some social events in the time left available? What chained her to the desk, to the typewriter and to the stories formed in her mind?\n“Escape?” I asked Theophil.\n“Her husband’s sudden death from pneumonia was an incentive to inject all she had into her work. You see, he believed in her. She wanted to prove him right. But that wasn’t all!”\n“Was vanity the further incentive?”\n“Have you recorded any?”\n“I haven’t,” I advised. “I sense some emotion I cannot classify; but – somehow – it appears familiar.”\n“No wonder,” he replied dryly; and displayed a scene from my own life in Wellington: a Peter Berger – with dim eyes and a nervous twitch – striving to add a few footnotes to his belaboured legal analysis.\n“Was your motivation money?”\n“Of course not,” I rebuked. “I wanted to establish my international credentials!”\n“Vanity?” he asked rhetorically.\n“To a certain extent,” I conceded. “But that wasn’t all.”\n“What else, then?”\n“A wish to escape from daily life coupled with an irrational drive to do something you feel you ought to do.” Pausing for a moment, I saw light: “an instinctive compulsion not explainable on any rational or emotive basis.”\n“A monomania: I’ve seen it possessing you when you looked for a specific piece of porcelain or a print.”\n“How do you explain it?”\n“A twist of the survival instinct, I think.” he said.\nHis hints explained one aspect respecting Barbara Brown’s books. At the moment, though, I was puzzled by one matter respecting them. True, I have not seen anyone of the books published under her name. But I had read three of them. They appeared under the name of Ruth Black. Was this Barbara Brown’s nom de plume?\n“It was not,” Theophil advised. “Here, meet Miss Ruth Black.”\n“Hello, Auntie: I’ve brought your lunch,” said the pleasant girl, in her mid twenties, who burst into the room. She was neatly made up, casually dressed and appeared self-assured and confident.\n“Thanks, Ruth,” Barbara responded and devoured the two Wimpy hamburgers ravenously. She had been too immersed in her work to notice she was hungry.\n“And you should eat more regularly,” Ruth chided her. “What did you take for breakfast?”\n“I can’t remember,” said Barbara.\n“You must have stepped straight to your typewriter when you got up; and on an empty stomach!”\n“Could be,” Barbara admitted. “You know how I get possessed when I want to write something down before I forget it.”\n“I know, but it’s not good for you. You can have breakfast in just ten minutes. That’s what I do every morning; and so can you.”\n“You are right,” conceded Barbara. “But bad habits die hard.”\n“I know,” Ruth summed up. “And Auntie: what are you writing?”\n“I am just about to finish ‘Bright Tiger’. I’ll send it to Fair Publishers; I haven’t tried them before.”\n“But Auntie: that’s not the way to do it. They may not even look at manuscripts sent in by people they don’t know. Why don’t you make an appointment to see the Editor or his Assistant: the personal touch, you know?”\n“Oh, I can’t be bothered. And I’m not sure it’ll do any good.”\n“But why not give it a try?”\n“I want to start writing ‘A Bleak Comedy’. I should have done so weeks ago.”\n“I understand,” Ruth appeared crestfallen. Before she left, she reminded her Aunt to send her a copy of the new manuscripts. She loved to read Barbara’s books and kept copies of each.\n“So, Ruth is a snake,” I said to Theophil.\n“Care to discuss it with Barbara? I won’t materialise you but we can ring her!”\nBarbara picked her receiver up promptly. At the very same time, my handphone appeared in my hand. There was a comic element in my ringing Barbara from her own room by using an advanced instrument made in another era.\n“Good day, Mrs. Brown,” I responded when I heard her ‘hallo’. “My name is Peter Berger. You don’t know me!”\n“And I don’t recognise your voice. Who are you?”\n“I’m from a different era. I come from 2006! A good friend guided me to times past!”\n“I’ve read H.G. Wells’ Time Machine. It’s fiction, isn’t it?”\n“His novella was. But time travel is feasible. My friend can travel regularly through time; and he can take others with him.”\n“But where are you?”\n“In the very same room as you. I rented the house in 2006.”\n“Can you see me?”\n“I can.”\n“So why can’t I see you?”\n“My friend won’t materialise me. But he has enabled me to ring you.”\nTo test me, she stuck out her tongue and asked me what she had done. Disapprovingly, I observed her tongue was heavily coated, indicating she was eating irregularly and smoking too much. I then told her there was no need to cover her eyes with her hands: neither of us was an ostrich.\n“I suppose I’ll have to accept the facts. Still, what made you ring me?”\n“I’ve read your books. They are brilliant. I couldn’t tear myself away from them.”\n“But how were you able to read them? Were they published? And reading all of them would take months. It took me years to write them.”\n“Theophil …” I started\n“… you mean your ephemeral friend?”\n“Precisely. You see, he ‘lent’ me some of his reading speed. Even so, it took me about half an hour!”\n“And this friend – your lover of theology – is he who I suspect he is?”\n“Yes!”\n“I understand,” she said, adding after a pause: “So you liked my books?”\n“I did – I mean, do. But look here: the strange thing is I’ve read three of them before. But according to the title page, the author was someone else.”\n“Who?”\n“Ruth Black – your niece. She has plagiarized your works. And Theophil tells me she published some others as well.”\n“Oh, well,” she said without any sign of anger or even change of expression.\n“I don’t understand. I thought you’d be furious. Ruth is – obviously – a snake in the grass! A thief!”\n“That’s one way of looking at it. But you see, I want people to read and enjoy my books. That’s why I write them. It doesn’t matter to me if Ruth published them under her name or mine. The main thing: the books saw light.”\n“Will you still give Ruth copies of new manuscripts?”\n“Of course. But now I must really get back to my work. It was nice talking to you. Ring me again when you are next around.”\nTheophil was neither astounded nor put off by Barbara’s reaction to her being plagiarised. To him Barbara’s response made sense.\n“But how could Ruth do such a thing? Didn’t she have qualms?”\n“Let me show you how she made her decision.”\nInstantly, we moved to a small office in East London, some ten years later. Barbara had died from a perforated ulcer three years earlier, leaving all her money and other possessions (including her manuscripts) to her niece. Ruth Black was immersed in a discussion of her aunt’s books with a young, radical and reasonably successful publisher. He was impressed by the books but, all the same, was reluctant to publish the work of an author who had failed to gain any recognition during her lifetime. He thought it was too risky. He added that the dialogue and general vocabulary had to be brought up to date.\n“I thought auntie’s style was excellent and modern.”\n“It was up to the standard of her own days. Language – especially English – metamorphoses constantly. Even for her own days, Barbara Brown’s choice of words was a bit pedantic, perhaps even old fashioned.”\n“Can anything be done about it?”\n“The manuscripts need editing – a revision. Why don’t you give it a try. You majored in English literature.”\nRuth heeded his words. Two years later she saw the same publisher again, with three fully revised manuscripts. To her delight he agreed to publish them but insisted Ruth should figure as the author. He saw no point in publishing them under the name of a long deceased, unrecognised, writer. Reluctantly, Ruth agreed. She salved her conscience by using the royalties to fund the Barbara Brown Scholarships for needy students. In the preamble to the trust deed, she recognised her debt and lauded Barbara’s achievements.\n“Ruth wasn’t really a snake in the grass,” I had to admit. “Just a collaborator in a piece of chicanery. Still, this way, these excellent books saw light. I’m glad they weren’t lost to posterity.”\n“I agree with your sentiment,” Theophil concluded as we re-entered my natural era. “Well, you better have a rest now.”\n“But before I do, please explain why this experience is relevant to the task I have accepted?”\n“It indicates that every emotion, thought and reaction is relative. This knowledge will stand you in good stead when you set out to deal with your lasting marriage.\nThe Musician A few days following my time travel to 1932, Theophil took me for my next trip. We surfaced near Radcliffe’s Camera: on a bright late spring morning. The air was crisp and the sun played on the cobblestones. As I looked around me, I saw a man in his mid-twenties, in a shabby leather jacket and corduroy trousers. He wore thick glasses, was unduly thin and his hair was receding. Staring fixedly in front of him, he proceeded to the entrance of the Bodleian reading rooms.\n“Did I really look so forlorn in 1959?” I asked.\n“You did rather,” he chuckled.\nTurning into Turl Street, we walked past Walters. Recalling days gone by, I insisted we step in. But the blazer I used to admire – and could not afford – appeared showy and vulgar. Reading my mind, Theophil pointed out that individual tastes changed over the years. In my youth I had been a moderately conservative dresser. I had, since then, become a fuddy duddy: a reactionary.\n“Would you wear corduroy trousers nowadays?”\n“Of course not,” I responded spiritedly. “I am 70! Might as well wear pink pyjamas!”\n“I’ll get them for you,” he chuckled.\nThe Broad looked exactly as I recalled it. For the sake of old times, we had tea in a coffee house opposite Blackwells. Most patrons were undergraduates, some accompanied by their girl friends. To my delight, the waitress wore the outfit I recalled.\nAbout fifteen minutes later we faced the old version of my present rental accommodation. The occupant – a middle-aged portly gentleman – had just finished shaving. On the sofa lay a cello, which he had played earlier in the morning. It bore witness to his occupation.\n“I’d like to meet him.”\n“I can’t materialise you or arrange a call on your handphone. He is superstitious: might start screaming.”\n“Oh, well,” I gave in gracefully.\n“But there is a way: care to join him for lunch?”\n“Oh, yes: but you can’t sit down at a stranger’s table?”\n“You can ‘join’ if they have a full house! I’ll nudge him to the Oxford Union.”\nThe cellist took the only vacant table. Having been laid for four, the chief waiter looked at him disapprovingly. He would have preferred him to take a high stool at the bar. When I went through the door, the chief waiter asked me if I would mind joining and led me to the same table. The cellist looked at me with interest as I placed my order.\n“In which district of Vienna did you live?” He wanted to know.\n“Leopoldstadt,” I retorted, referring to the 2nd predominantly Jewish district of the town.\n“I thought so – from your accent. I, too, come from there. I’m Heinz Popper.”\n“Peter Berger. And it’s nice to meet you. When did you leave?”\n“In 1936: I saw the writing on the wall.”\n“My parents fled in 1938: just in time.”\nWhen his first course was placed in front of him, I urged him to start. He tried the soup, muttered it was too hot and waited until my starter arrived. Sensing he was responsive, I asked what his line of business was. It turned out he was the lead cellist of a well-known London orchestra. He had been with it for more than ten years.\n“Do you give recitals?”\n“Very seldom. I’m not a soloist. But I play regularly with a chamber orchestra.”\n“I know very little about music. I can’t even tell a specific instrument – except a harp and percussions – when I listen to a concert.”\n“So, you do go to concerts?”\n“Well, yes; but not often: only when they perform pieces I’m fond of.”\n“Like?” he persevered.\n“Sibelius’ Violin Concerto; Spring, Chopin or one of Mozart’s piano concertos.”\n“You probably know more than you think,” he said supportively. “Very few people can identify individual instruments when they listen to an orchestra. Do you play an instrument?”\n“I’m afraid not.”\n“That’s the explanation. Your hearing develops as you play.”\nFor a while, we continued to talk about music. He had chosen the cello mainly because of its mellow tone and elegance. Chance, too, had played its role. Some two years after he had started to take violin lessons, he had inherited his grandfather’s cello. Out of curiosity, he tried it out and came to like it. In due course, he switched to it.\n“Can you tell the cello when you listen to a piece?”\n“I can. I get upset if one of the cellists is no good.”\nEventually, I assumed the courage to ask what had dissuaded him from becoming a soloist. Solo pieces for cello were uncommon, he explained; the demand for cello soloists was not there. But, he added, even if he had concentrated on some other instrument – like the violin – he would have opted for a musical chair rather than a soloist’s career. Employment by an orchestra provided security and enabled you to lead a normal life. You could keep regular working hours and had the chance to engage in teaching. You had a base and you could bring up a family.\nA soloist, in contrast, had a harum scarum existence: travelling whenever invited and, except in the case of top performers, having no steady income. Instead, there was the endless waiting for prestigious invitations. Worse still, when the concert was over, the soloist was left on his (or her) own, often spending evenings in an impersonal hotel room. No wonder so many soloists remained single, gave up or, alas, committed suicide.\n“What determines a soloist’s success?”\n“To start with a soloist must be good; but that’s not all. He must believe in himself, be confident, be good in his PR and have some presence or charisma. A mentor can, of course, help. But you need luck. I can think of a few excellent musicians who have preferred a steady engagement in a good orchestra to the soloist’s limelight.”\n“The same considerations apply in other fields too,” I conceded.\n“In yours?” he wanted to know.\nIt did not take him long to grasp the difference between the role of a dedicated court room advocate and the less glamorous existence of the backstage solicitor or notary. The litigation attorney had to be endowed with confidence and needed good tactical ability and timing. He had to be quick on his feet and often had to know how to counter bombshells whenever they were thrown at him.\nThe solicitor, whose main task was to prepare documents, had to have the same practical grasp and discerning eye as a court room advocate. Often, he, too, worked long hours and had to grope with minute details. In the ultimate, though, he was the master of his own time and could plan his progress. Once he left his office for the day, he had the right not to be disturbed.\n“I take it you opted for the backstage?” he observed.\n“Not exactly. I was too slow on my feet to opt for the limelight. However, I found the endless drafting of documents a bore.”\n“Well, what did you do?”\n“I became a law teacher. The university offers a safe career and a comfortable way of life. And I had no wish to become rich.”\n“So, you compromised?”\n“I suppose so. But I do enjoy my career. And I get a lot of ‘opinion work’.”\n“What is that?”\n“Some generalist lawyers ask me to opine when they get cases or difficult transactions in my area. I enjoy it; and it pays.”\n“ctually, you have a foot in both camps.”\n“I do, rather. And this way, I have my share of the limelight.”\n“That’s why I perform with a chamber ensemble. I lead it.”\n“Doesn’t your wife mind your being out so often?” I asked naively.\n“She left me some time ago. For years we used to play in the same orchestra. Then she fell in love with a young violin soloist and eloped with him.”\n“How long did it take you to recover?” I asked.\n“My pride was dented and I kept regretting my decision to turn down the chance of becoming a soloist. Still, time is a great healer: when she wanted to come back to me after two years, I refused. Fortunately, we had no children.”\nWe had coffee together in the Broad. We then walked together in the direction of the house in Walton Street. Shortly before we reached it, I took my leave.\n“Shall we return to your era?” asked Theophil.\n“Why not take a walk?”\nStarting at Addison’s Walk in Magdalen College, we walked by Merton College and onward to Christchurch Meadows. As we proceeded, a squirrel hopped onto my shoulder and looked at me expectantly. It accepted the nut proffered by Theophil, cracked it open with its sharp teeth, jumped back to its tree and disappeared in a hole in the trunk.\nTo my chagrin, my glasses were getting misty. Looking at me sympathetically, my mentor observed that I had been walking down memory lane. No wonder my emotions were getting the better of me.\n“Were these my happiest days?” I asked him.\n“You didn’t think so then.”\n“The future was so uncertain. My heart was full of foreboding!”\n“It’s your nature, Peter’le. When you drink, you see the empty portion of the cup. Later, you recall the cup as it looked when it was filled to its brim.”\n“You may be right,” I conceded. “But how can anybody know, in retrospect, which were his happiest days?”\n“It’s simple. Would you want me to turn your clock back? It can be done.”\n“Actually, I’d rather stay put,” I told him after a pause. “Better the …”\n“ … devil you know than the one you haven’t experienced,” he chuckled. “No, Peter’le, I’m not offended. I know what you mean. You have traversed life from childhood to old age. You have usually been quite contented with your lot or – in the very least – you came to terms with it. In contrast, the ‘unknown’ is ‘uncertain’. You fear it.”\n“True.”\n“So let us proceed with your afternoon walk,” he concluded.\n“You mean: our walk,” I corrected him. “You have held my hand from day one. I happen to know.”\nShortly thereafter, we reached St. Aldate’s. For a while, I kept staring at Tom Tower. Despite its pomp, I loved it. It had been an integral part of my old world. As we emerged back in my era, I had just one question to ask.\n“Oxford changed my life, Theophil. What happened?”\n“During your days in Israel, the idols of your home clashed with the milieu of your school. You realised that both were bent when you travelled to Italy with your mother. But you didn’t accept the Italian norms: the trip filled you with doubts.”\n“I never accepted Oxford’s British mores, surely?”\n“No, you didn’t. But Oxford opened your eyes. You realised that you had the right to make your own choices. You too had a voice to raise; and you did.”\n“Did Oxford set me free?”\n“It did, rather. It enabled you to exercise your right to individuality. There was no longer a need to search for a mid-way.”\n“I understand. This entire period was crucial, definitive. Is this why you chose to reveal yourself to me during it.”\n“Surely, I did not reveal myself to you in Oxford.”\n“I know. But I met you in the opera when I visited my father in Vienna; in 1960.”\n“Care to revisit the event?” he asked magnanimously.\n“Wouldn’t I ever?”\nThe performance of Freischütz lacked lustre. Weber’s music was dull; and the libretto was, as I well knew, childish. Father, who was sitting to my right was equally bored. We had intended to book seats for the Rosenkavalier but got muddled over the dates. The patron sitting to my left appeared a colourless, middle-aged run of the mill Viennese. During the first two acts, I hardly noticed him. During the intermission, though, as I queued up at the bar for a drink and snack, he was standing in front of me.\n“It’s a long queue,” he muttered as people shuffled their feet.\n“Is it always so crowded?” I asked.\n“Not really, especially when it’s not a mainstream event: like a Verdi or Puccini. But quite a few people thought they were showing a Richard Strauss opera tonight.”\nWhen – at long last – we were served our drinks, he asked me to join him at the high tabletop adjacent to the bar. For a few moments we talked about operas. When I told him my favourite was Carmen, he pointed out that, like Freischütz, it abounded with prejudices about the supernatural.\n“Still, Bizet’s music is more exciting than Weber’s,” he conceded. “I enjoyed the premiere. It was great, although the audience did not appreciate the last two acts.”\nHis words gave me a jolt. Carmen was first performed in 1874. I wondered whether I had heard him correctly. But, before I had the chance to ask, the bell summoned the crowd back.\n“You better return to your seat,” he told me.\n“Aren’t you going back?”\n“I don’t like the remaining part. I’ll give it a miss.”\n“This was our first encounter, wasn’t it?” I asked my friend.\n“The first in which I gave you a hint. You perceived me earlier on but without a clue it was me.”\n“But what was your object in 1960?”\n“To make you ponder. To prepare the ground for the future.”\nTheophil’s materialisation had had its desired effect. My heart and instincts told me whom I had met. My mind, though, remained sceptical. Should the logical equations I had accepted for years be affected by such a chance meeting? I sought to dismiss the event as a hallucination. All the same, my staunch atheistic philosophy was shaken. It dawned on me that the universe was more complex than I had assumed. Dismissing the supernatural out of hand was as dogmatic as a blind adherence to faith.\n“You certainly made your point that day in 1960,” I told my friend. “You are a good teacher.”\n“Thanks for the compliment” he replied.\nAs I looked around me, realising we had once again returned to 2006, a small parcel surfaced on the sofa in the sitting room. The tracksuit contained was of greyish pink. It looked warm and comfortable.\n“Wear it as you walk in the park,” Theophil advocated. “It is more suitable – more useful – than a pair of pink pajamas.”\nMilestones During the next few mornings of my visit to Oxford, I jogged in the park. The tracksuit given to me by Theophil was warm and comfortable and fitted like a glove. The swans on the Cherwell looked at me with interest. So did some of the punters who made their way up the river.\nHaving finished my work at the library, I kept revising my draft in my study in the house in Walton Street. One morning, as I raised my head from the sheaf of papers in front of me, Peppi Stölzl faced me across the table. He looked as he was in his late eighties. His hair was grey streaked with white. He was no longer too heavily set but did not look gaunt; and his broad shoulders gave him an aura of robustness.\n“Hi, Peppi: nowadays Theophil calls on me in his other form. What’s up?”\n“You are going for a trip of revelations. We want to get you ready and to humour you. You love to see Peppi!”\n“True: seeing him puts me at my ease. But what’s so special about this trip?”\n“We move from the present to the past: your own past. We are not restrained by a pre-determined spot like your rented house.”\n“In any event, I’ve just rented the house; I’ve got no ‘past’ in it.”\n“Actually, you had a glimpse at the house when you looked for lodgings in 1959. But the room had been taken. So, you ended up in Newton Road.”\n“So, this house was never my centre. Where are we going to?”\n“To milestones in your life! We are travelling backward.”\n“Very well. And when do we start?” I asked him.\n“We did so a few minutes ago. We are in Oxford, in 2006. Where shall we make our next stop?”\n“In Singapore: my emeritation?”\nThe Kallang Theatre was fully packed. Law degrees were to be conferred on students who had finished their Bachelor of Laws course. In addition, five of my research students were to be awarded their Masters. I, too, was the recipient of an award. Some years had elapsed since any staff member had been constituted an Emeritus Professor. My selection was an act of recognition. But it also signaled my retirement from full service!\nAs the University Orator narrated my attainments, a sad ambience descended on me. What had I really achieved? A safe place by the academic hearth backed by a long list of sound publications, none of which would be read by the end of the decade. I may have fooled the world: but not myself. True, I had made the careers of some bright men and women. Some had been appointed to the Bench; others had made their own academic careers; and others still were successful lawyers. All the same, I knew that each of them would have got to his target even without me. In a process of natural selection, the individual educator had but a minor role to play.\nAs the University Orator’s tirade reached a new peak, I spotted my wife and guests. They were sitting in the second row of the huge hall. Pat was smiling: was it an expression of satisfaction or, perhaps, just good manners? We had never been happy together. Was she, nevertheless, pleased by the University’s decision to honour me?\n“In some ways, Pat is a simple soul, Peterl’e,” Theophil whispered. “She is proud of you. She basks in your glory.”\n“What glory?” I asked sardonically. “And Pat’s no fool!”\n“She isn’t. But she is keenly aware of the honour conferred on her husband.”\n“Well, I am not! It’s hollow!”\n“I don’t think so,” he countered. “But to you it does appear this way. You see, it’s your wake-up call but you aren’t ready to be passed over. You want to hold on!”\n“Is that why I looked for a fresh link?”\n“That’s one reason. The other is the void in your personal life!”\nHe was right. My years in Singapore brought me professional laurels. My personal life had remained in the disarray occasioned by my myopia. I had little to be ashamed off; but even less to brag about.\n“Where do you want to make our next stop? It has to be your choice, Peter’le.”\n“Monash; saying farewell to Carol.”\nMy decision to resign had been made after what had appeared a prolonged agony. I kept counting the pros and the cons, getting mixed results. In truth, though, my decision had been made as soon as I received Singapore’s final offer. Two years earlier on I had turned down an offer to move to London. The salary was poor and I feared the harsh climate. In addition, I was not ready for a change. When the unexpected deterioration in my wife’s eyesight ruled out a move to London, I became ready to make the ‘sacrifice’ of staying put. Relief overrode regrets.\nThe offer to move back to Singapore – my wife’s hometown – made room for a salvage operation. In Melbourne we led an isolated existence. And we were falling apart. Singapore presented the opportunity for a fresh start.\nBefore we left, I called on Carol. I had visited her house in the Carlton district on previous occasions. A student who lived across the road saw me when I walked in. Being a simple soul, he concluded that two and two made five. In truth, though, it had not been an affair. When Carol was ready to say ‘yes’ I failed to act. When I made a feeble attempt, it was too late. Outwardly, we remained on good terms. Rumours about us were rife although the smoke was thin. During my nine years at Monash, I remained the moth attracted by the candle’s flame. I was scourged in the process but – all in all – the scars remained superficial. A positive response could have done more harm.\nThat evening, I came over because Carol had invited me. Her influence had, actually, abated during two periods of leave I had taken when my administrative duties at the University became too much for me. It dawned on me that, notwithstanding the spell Carol had cast over me, life was simpler without her.\nMy decision to leave Monash was not a direct result of the entanglement with her. It was my realisation that I had been promoted to my level of incompetence. Managing people had never been my skill. My strength was in research and, to a lesser extent, in teaching. When Monash appointed me, the Selection Board had overlooked my patent inadequacies for a post requiring leadership.\n“When are you leaving?” asked Carol soon after I entered her house. Even as she spoke, I felt the old admiration and desire. True, Carol was not a beauty: her features were too sharp, too accentuated. But her effervescent personality, her ability to call a spade a spade and her down-to-earth mannerism had remained captivating.\n“By the end of the month.”\n“What made you decide?”\n“The hope Pat will be happier there.”\n“She won’t,” Carol spoke soberly. “You were wrong for one another from the start. The rift is too deep to heal. I wish you well. But don’t kid yourself.”\n“You are, probably, right. I wish I knew what really prompted me to resign.”\n“The need for a fresh start. I think it’s the right decision.”\n“Have I been a total failure here?”\n“I don’t think so. You were alright when you got back into your banking law. Your attempt to get into the policy-oriented areas was unreal. You are not interested in policy and law reform.”\nCarol was thinking of a book on Legal Change we had been working on for five years. I had completed some of my chapters but Carol kept pulling back. She remained committed to American realism, which searched for sociological motivations behind abstract legal principles, such as a judge’s prejudices based on race, sex and class. I was searching for the historical origin of principles and for their conceptual basis. Each approach was legitimate. But they were incompatible. At the end of my second sabbatical spell, when my new text on banking law was getting into shape, I gave Carol my completed chapters of Legal Change and suggested she better proceed on her own. It turned out to be the end of the project.\n“You were right about our research project. The book was doomed from the start,” I conceded. “Is it because I am a conceptualist, divorced from real life?”\n“I don’t think so,” she replied candidly. “You are pragmatic when you deal with the facts of some sordid commercial dispute. But you don’t care whether a party is a poor slob, a racially disadvantaged minority person or a wealthy bank. You want to tackle the concepts and win the case.”\n“True; I work for my client: once I accept a brief.”\n“In reality, policy is irrelevant to you. To me it matters.”\n“I know. The truth is: I wanted to work with you. So, I suggested the book.”\nTo my relief, she did not persist. Did she know I had confused the scholar with the woman? I had had my doubts about her intellect all along. She was encyclopaedic and good at repartee but lacked substance. When, for instance, she criticised a bank that called up a mortgage loan, she closed her eyes to the fact that the bank was not a philanthropist. It would have turned the borrower’s application down if the Credit Officer had suspected difficulties in its repayment.\nThe scholar in Carol was one-eyed. The woman, in contrast, was fascinating: a Roman Catholic convent girl metamorphosed into a radical. It had taken me a while to realise that many of her acts and attitudes were motivated by her need to rebel. She had been unable to walk away from the hearth without a fuss. My own separation from many tenets of Judaism had been less dramatic. I had shaken off the bonds but, at the same time, kept my foot in the door. The road back remained traversable.\nAs Carol prepared the meal, I reflected that on all previous occasions we had gone out for lunch or dinner. All in all, Carol’s cooking left much to be desired. The fish was undercooked, the vegetables tasteless and the potatoes soggy. The wine I had brought with me was poor; but then, my taste in wines had been defective all along.\nDuring the dire repast we engaged in small talk. Had I ever managed to kindle some response in her? As often before, the answer eluded me. Perhaps I was no longer interested in the subject. I was relieved when I sensed the time was ready for my departure. As I left, Carol gave me a cold goodbye kiss on the cheek. It was a befitting end to a spell in dreamland.\n“Were my years in Monash a waste of time?” I asked Theophil.\n“You entrenched your academic credentials during the period. You were a well-regarded minor scholar when you joined. You left as one of the leading men in your field.”\n“But my personal life?”\n“It was a mess both before and after Monash. I fear Pat would agree.”\n“Why have I been such an utter failure with women?\n“You weren’t, Peter’le. Quite a few nice family girls bestowed gentle glances on you. But you kept looking at glamour women who caught your fancy.”\n“Why was I so blind?” I asked, realising he had put his finger on the pulse.\n“I can’t be certain. Still, I suspect that you were obsessed by the need to maintain your independence. Plain Janes are possessive: you looked in another direction. And you were guided by your sexual impulses.”\n“Did they drive me to Pat? She was attractive,” I told him\n“So she was; and she had the mystique of the East. That’s why you fell for her. You did not realise she was a possessive and insecure girl. She expected a lot from you; and you were not ready to deliver.”\n“Was a divorce the only solution?” I asked.\n“Perhaps. But you were unable to set yourself free. And when Pat wanted to leave, you asked her to stay. You were not acting rationally but compulsively.”\n“Where shall we make our next stop – in Wellington?”\n“Yes,” I nodded. “Do you think our Bridge session at lunch is worth a re-visit?”\nThe Staff Common Room in the Rankine Brown Building was crowded during lunch time. The snacks were inexpensive and the coffee strongly brewed. It was more convenient to have a quick meal there than to take the cable car down to Lambton Quay.\nMost staff members congregated at a table occupied by other members of their own department. The Bridge players alone were interdisciplinary. As soon as four of us arrived, we started to play. Later arrivals were given the chance to play by ‘cutting out’ one of those who had already played four hands.\nThe daily Bridge game was a relaxation. None of us took our sessions seriously. It was a pleasant pastime for the midday break. Over the years, I came to know most amateur Bridge players in the University: engineers, sociologists, political scientists, philosophers and administrators. If they knew the game, they were welcome to join in.\nIn the early years I was in doubt as to whether to join my colleagues from the Law Faculty or to partake in the game. In most instances, I was guided by my instincts, which told me that Bridge was a pleasant game whilst the administration of the Law School was tedious and that discussing it with my long-winded colleagues was a bore. After a few months, the lawyers ignored my arrival whilst the Bridge players made room for me.\nThe Bridge game had a further advantage. It saved the need to ring my wife during lunch time. I knew she felt cooped up at home and was thoroughly unhappy. The meetings of the wives of the diplomatic core, which she attended regularly, exacerbated the problem. She envied those who came over for just a stint of three or five years. She yearned to be back in Singapore or – in the very least – in a more cosmopolitan environment. Her success as an amateur potter was of little help. She did not believe in her own creativity, although many of our friends thought her pieces were exceptional.\n“I suspect that, but for her, I should have stayed put,” I told Theophil.\n“I am not certain. You knew your research was getting stale and your personal life brought you no satisfaction. You needed fresh horizons.”\n“Was there a point of no return?”\n“Let’s look for it,” he suggested.\nThe social worker had taken her leave. She appeared neither surprised nor disappointed by our decision. After eight years of a childless marriage, Pat had suggested we adopt. We had tried all other avenues – but our case kept eluding the specialists. Pat was convinced it was my fault. The medical men kept mum.\nWhen we contacted the Social Welfare Department personnel, they recommended a baby boy fathered by a Singapore Chinese on a New Zealand girl. All went well but – at the very last minute – Pat changed her mind. She was not prepared to adopt a boy. In addition, under the law of New Zealand, an adoptee had the right to be told the identity of his (or her) natural parents. Pat found this an unpalatable constraint.\n“You must be disappointed,” Pat said when we were left on our own.\n“Not at all,” I lied. “As Miss Lawrence told us: if in doubt, don’t adopt because you may not love the baby. She also said you must adopt for the sake of the child; not for your own personal reasons.”\n“Do you think she is right?”\n“I think so. But when couples want to adopt it is usually because they are childless or can’t have more children.”\nTo my dismay, Pat started to cry. She had cried in the same manner when she turned down a suitable job in a bank I found for her after a long search. Another disappointment had been her decision to discontinue her studies at the University. She had done well in her first two terms but, alas, was unable to adapt. On that occasion, she made her announcement calmly; but I realised she had become bitter.\n“Why was the failed adoption the point of no return?” I asked Theophil.\n“You realised Pat’s feelings of insecurity and inadequacy were the real block. She would not have another go at adoption. Where did this leave you?”\n“With a barren marriage and a career …”\n“… getting routine and hence boring. The Bridge game was not an adequate compensation. You were too young to move backstage. A change of venue was the only realistic way out.”\n“I could have divorced Pat?”\n“You were unable and unwilling to do so.”\n“That sums it up, rather. Theophil: why did I propose to her?”\nThe Residential Fellow’s flat at King Edward VII Hall, the medical students’ dormitory near Singapore’s General Hospital, was compact. It had a spacious sitting room, a bedroom and a convenience. There was no kitchenette. Fellows were expected to participate in the students’ meals. This way we had the opportunity to meet them.\nI had met Pat about a year after I had moved into the Hall. We were introduced by a colleague, who had dated two girls for the same evening. I accepted the unexpected invitation to join them when he assured me that I should be his guest. In the end, though, he stuck me with the bill. I avenged myself by dating his girlfriend.\nAfter a few weeks, I started to take Pat out regularly. Before long we were going steady. After some time, she started to visit me in the Hall. One of the revelations made to me was that Pat had spent a few months in the local TB hospital. She had been cured by antibiotics. At the very last moment, an operation was pronounced unnecessary.\nI met Pat some two years after her discharge. Over dinners and visits to my flat, she told me about her harassing spell in hospital. Fortunately, there was no danger of a relapse. Her spirit, though, had not recovered. She missed the boyfriend who had jilted her when she was diagnosed. Further, she remained unemployed. The impoverished condition of her once wealthy family was another cause for concern. She could not remain idle for too long.\nEven so, Pat did not see me as Prince Charming appearing from nowhere. When I proposed, she had a reservation. Jews, she told me, had been persecuted persistently. She had misgivings about marrying in. In addition, she knew I was not an easy man to manage. I had my own idiosyncrasies, was a career rather than family orientated and had a hard and stubborn core. All the same, she accepted: she preferred a European to another Chinese and – I suspect – knew that few of her countrymen would show an interest in a girl with her medical history.\n“Why did I propose?” I asked Theophil. “I sensed it would be a mismatch.”\n“You found her attractive. Also, you were still on the rebound. You feared to miss the bus again.”\n“When did I decide to propose?”\n“Probably, long before you did. You passed the point of no return when you started to date her. Your mind turned her faults – her difficult character and her patent unsuitability – into virtues. You wanted to show you could accomplish the impossible, Peter Pygmalion.”\n“How about her resistance to pre-marital sex?”\n“It underwrote her aura of mystique.”\n“So, I made a fool of myself?”\n“I don’t think so,” he countered. “Pat has been a faithful and constant wife for over forty years. True, no love was left; perhaps there wasn’t much to start with. But how many loving couples have you met in your life? And I suspect many a wife would have run away from you. You can be impossible!”\n“Thanks,” I muttered.\n“Telling the truth can test a friendship,” he replied.\n“Not when you ask a friend to tell you the truth!”\nThe kaleidoscope kept turning to scenes from my old days in Singapore. The visits with Pat to local antiques shops, the long evening walks along the night market that stretched for about two kilometers along Tanglin Road and Orchard Road and the pleasant meals in local food courts and hawker centres. My working life, too, was reflected. The fan-ventilated lecture rooms; the stormy Faculty meetings and my regular spells in the library.\n“Why did I leave Singapore?”\n“Your premature and unsuccessful application for promotion and the need to look for fresh pastures. And you hoped a move would detach Pat from her family.”\n“It didn’t,” I told him.\n“I know. It was a lost cause from the start. The two of you never made it and so she had to look back at the family hearth. Your having remained childless exacerbated the problem. You were unable to build up your own family environment.”\nI saw no point in revisiting Oxford. We had done so on our previous trips. It was time to shift the kaleidoscope to my twenty years in Tel Aviv. They were the formative years, in which my character and aspirations were forged out of a sickly childhood and of my inability to fit into my environment. Despite its remoteness, this period was the branch on which I had been sitting later in life. It could not be cut away. All the same, I had no wish to put these years under a powerful lens.\n“You feel no need to meander through your youth?” queried Theophil.\n“I do not. But I’m not certain why!”\n“Are you afraid of opening Pandora’s box?”\n“I suspect I am,” I confessed, adding after a pause: “I must overcome these baseless fears. Very well then let’s resume our trip.”\nDonolo Hospital was on the outskirts of Jaffa. I had been admitted when, after a lengthy court case, my chest could not take any more. My hissing breath and appalling pallor told their story. The Head of the ward – a well-known consultant of internal medicine – decided to make a last effort to break the hold of my asthma. It had to be carried out under medical supervision.\nInitially, all went well. Then, during a cold spell, I caught a chill. Late one night I experienced an attack of breathlessness. Dr. Bruner was unavailable. Mahmood Diab, the male nurse in charge of the ward, sat by my side during my struggle. Postponing the administration of an injection, which would have brought instant relief, he insisted I should try to combat the attack on my own. If I shook off the ensuing panic, the spell of breathlessness would come under control.\nIn the event, I succeeded. When it was over, I smiled at him gratefully. He smiled back with patent relief. I then noticed that his hand, which I had grasped throughout my ordeal, was swollen.\nMahmood Diab became a close friend. We went out regularly for lunch, dinner or a show. Regrettably, Mahmood had to leave Donolo. He had fallen in love with a Sephardic nurse. When her brother, who served in the Military Police, found out, he had Mahmood beaten up. A transfer to a hospital in Haifa was Mahmood’s best way out. Dahlia, though, was a constant nymph. Though uninvited, she kept calling on him in his new quarters on Mount Carmel. On one such occasion she arrived when three Arab fugitives, Mahmood’s group had been sheltering, were about to depart. Dismayed by her discovery, Dahlia consulted her brother. Having witnessed his wrath, she rang me. Would I see how to save Mahmood from the clutches of the Military Police?\nMy old bomb – a Ford Anglia – stood us in good stead. When I arrived at Mahmood’s premises shortly after dawn, he packed his few possessions and was ready to leave within ten minutes. To avoid an undesirable encounter, we took an indirect route out of Haifa. Shortly before lunchtime, Mahmood told me to stop on the outskirts of Tiberias. To ensure my safety, he decided to cover the remaining few miles by a local bus.\nHaving no wish to return home, I drove to Jerusalem, with a view to spending two days in the University library. Early next morning, I took some documents for stamping by the Registrar of Companies’ office. To my delight the attendant had forgotten to adjust the date on her rubber stamp. The imprint suggested the documents had been stamped on the previous morning. In consequence, I had an iron clad alibi for the day involved.\n“Did you step in aid?” I asked Theophil.\n“Of course not,” he grinned. “But I nudged her to think of her errant boyfriend. In the process, she forgot all about her rubber stamp for some forty minutes. Naturally, she was not going to blabber about her lapse. You – my dear Peter’le – reaped the benefit of her state of confusion.”\nIn the event, although one of Mahmood flat mates told the Military Police of my involvement, no alibi was needed. The force thought it best to shove the incident under the carpet. But a stern warning – coupled with a suggestion that I make suitable plans for my own future – was conveyed informally. To my surprise, though, Officer Kaplan concluded his homily by conceding that, if Jewish refugees had asked for his protection in Europe, he would have given it. He could understand – perhaps even sympathise with – my act.\n“In peace,” he told me, “friendship and loyalty are assets. In war they can turn into a liability.”\n“Are we then in a state of war with our neighbours?” I asked him.\n“Surely, you know the answer!”\n“Theophil,” I asked my pilot, “what bound me to Mahmood? Was it just gratitude for his having helped me to break the grip of my asthma?”\n“That was the initial cause – the causa causans. But it went much deeper than that! Have a look.”\nThat day, Mahmood had called unexpectedly. I knew something was on his mind but thought it best not to probe until after dinner. I was about to proceed when Mahmood came to the point without any prompting on my part. In a shaky voice, he told me about certain atrocities that had been committed by the Israeli army in an Arab village. Our soldiers had destroyed property, had raped women and had killed children and innocent old people. I had heard some rumours about the massacre but had tried to disbelieve my ears. Having listened to Mahmood without interruption, I experienced a deep – biting – sense of shame.\n“Eli,” he asked, using my Hebrew name, “what are your politicians trying to do? Israel’s only hope of survival is to come to terms with us. And the people killed by your soldiers were not enemies or terrorists. They were peaceful Falachim: all they wanted was to live and let live!”\nMahmood’s narration cemented our friendship. I realised he would not have referred to the sordid episode unless he had full trust in the listener. He knew he could count on my sympathy.\n“Well, you see, Peter’le,” confided Theophil. “We are not dealing with hidden passions or desires. You had no such inclinations, drives or urges. Mahmood Diab brought to the surface that strange sense of national guilt, a communal sense of responsibility, that had plagued the Jews from times immemorial. If a gentile commits an atrocity, you dub him a brute, a barbarian or a savage. If the predator is Jewish, you feel ashamed – even if you had never heard his name before!”\nHe was right. According to our folklore, the Jews were a chosen people: a holy nation of priests. Politically, they were the underdogs; but notwithstanding persistent persecutions they had managed to cling to their heavenly heritage. Although the Viennese Jews of my parents’ generation were amused by such fantasies, they too believed in the ‘superiority’ of the Jewish ethos. In their own way, the assimilated mid-European Jews were patronising and objectionable.\n“You see, Peter’le,” proceeded Theophil, “you were taught in school that the atrocities of the Holocaust or of Russian pogroms were not something ‘your people’ would ever carry out. Mahmood exposed the fallacy. He opened your eyes to the plain truth: the Mongols, the Turks, the Cossacks and the Huns were no angels. Your own people were no better. Violence, cruelty and disregard for aliens are part and parcel of human nature.”\n“Homo homini lupus,” I stammered.\n“No, Peter’le: wolves are faithful and warm hearted animals, although they are not kind to hunters! The correct saying is: ‘homo homini monstrum’.”\n“Some people rise above this,” I protested. “Peppi was ready to sacrifice his life for my family’s survival.”\n“And you, mon cher Pierre, took a similar risk to save Mahmood! So perhaps you too were not a plain monstrum!”\n“A mixed-up character: between a saint and a …”\n“… devil from hell,” he chuckled. “Quite so, Peter’le. Perhaps Erasmus was nearer to the truth when he said: homo homini aut deus aut lupus.”\nI decided to revisit my four years in Secondary School. During that period, I had grown from an unformed boy into a youth. The child – even if not innocent – was superseded by a teenager, with his own aspirations and view of life. In some regards he was still immature and biased; but his eyes were open and observant. Behind the cynical façade and the selfishness produced by ill health and caring parents, he had developed the urge to be liked. Many of his acts were dictated by this need.\n“How can I meander through these years?” I asked Theophil. “They were full and rich: the formative years!”\n“Why not traverse the entire period and focus on the telling episodes. You’ll recognise them as we skim through your youth.”\nMy school days were brightened by interesting and creative classes. Much as I disliked Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry, I had the stamina to memorise their essentials. The subjects I enjoyed were Literature, Composition, History and Bible Studies. The last was enhanced by the excellent classes of our Biblical Studies Master, a shriveled, rapidly ageing but charismatic lecturer. His dispassionate, critical analysis of the Book of Job and of Jeremiah had a lasting effect on my intellectual life.\n‘Old Frank’ – as we had nicknamed him – was an eccentric and, unlike most of our teachers, an atheist. Although the school’s guidelines required teachers to show due respect to our traditions during Bible Classes, his skullcap usually dropped off shortly after he entered the classroom. In contrast, the secular boys in the class kept their Yarmulkes on, mainly out of respect for orthodox classmates.\nOn one occasion, when our Principal – dubbed Sheen on account of his bald pate – made a surprise visit to our form, Frank’s skullcap was lying beside the book on his desk. Sheen looked at him disapprovingly and, a few minutes later, was incensed when Frank exposed two verses which he considered interpolations. Sheen’s orthodox outlook found such views intolerable.\n“Our school’s policy requires teachers to cover their head in Bible Classes,” he told Frank.\n“I am sorry, Sir,” stammered Frank. Placing the Yarmulke back on his head, he added: “please forgive the oversight.”\nEverybody was shocked. A rebuke in public, especially of an eccentric teacher close to retirement, was monstrous. If Sheen felt like making a remark, he could have done so in private, during the break.\nSomething had to be done. “Sir, this rule of covering your head – does it apply to teachers and pupils alike?”\n“No; it doesn’t,” advised Sheen, embarrassed by his outburst and ill at ease. “It applies only to our teachers and only in respect of religious studies.”\n“Thank you, Sir,” I responded and removed the skullcap from my own head. Most of our classmates, including an orthodox friend of mine, followed suit. For a few seconds Sheen stared at us. He then left the room. As soon as he was gone Frank resumed his class. We, in turn, replaced our head attire.\n“You admired Old Frank,” observed Theophil.\n“I did; still do. He taught me that the Old Testament is a magnificent literary work of art. I love it but do not accept it either as a historical truth or as a divine revelation.”\n“You have read it daily since you left Israel!” Theophil told me.\n“I have. It is my foot in the door; and I remain grateful to my teacher!”\n“You protested when Sheen humiliated him. But did you rebel just out of respect and sympathy for him?” he probed.\n“What else?” I prevaricated.\n“Wasn’t it a declaration of independence?”\n“It was,” I conceded. “I was willing to show tolerance; but would not submit to coercion.”\nFor the next half hour, I re-visited cherished scenes from that long gone by period. During the summer and early autumn, I used to roam on our beaches: Bat-Yam, Herzliya, Caesarea and as far north as Tantura. Notwithstanding my bad chest, I was an accomplished swimmer. During weekends I rowed with friends on the Yarkon and, on rare occasions, drove over to Tiberias.\nDuring the evenings, my home was the meeting place of a circle of friends from amongst my classmates. An indoor football set was much in demand. Occasionally, we played cards and, from time to time, mahjong or dominoes. During the local festival of Purim, we marched through the streets in masquerade. I recall the chaos we had caused when we put on Ku Klux Klan uniforms and chanted tunes from Gone with the Wind. Next day, a local rag described our performance as childish and inarticulate: a silly debacle dreamed up by a bunch of pseudo-intellectuals, who merited a punch in the nose.\n“So – in retrospect – what do you say of your secondary school days?”\n“All in all, they were good days, marred, alas, by asthma and bronchitis. I hate to think how I had to miss out on our school’s trip to Masada and to the Galilee.”\n“But were there compensations?” he probed.\nHis query reminded me of the development of my reading habit. Even during my primary school days, I was a voracious reader. By the time I was fourteen, I had covered German literature and had read translations (into German or Hebrew) of the major Russian, French, Italian and English writers. During my secondary school days, I taught myself to read English and American writers in their own language. This way they gained momentum. I recall the pleasure I derived from The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and from Light in August.\n“Is there any specific episode you want to re-live?”\n“Most people would wish to re-visit their first day in school, their first sexual encounter and – I suspect – their graduation ceremony?”\n“And you?” asked Theophil\n“I want to find out what induced me to read for law. My mother wanted me to study medicine. Coming to think of it, would I have been any good at it?”\n“You did not have the hands, the eye and the presence of mind of a good surgeon,” he told me. “You would have been a tolerable diagnostician; but your bedside manner would have been appalling and your hypochondria and fear of sicknesses would have been a handicap.”\n“So it is fortunate I opted for another calling.”\n“It is,” he agreed; “here, let us see how you made your decision.”\nThe examination in Basic Mathematics and Algebra, administered by the Department of Education, was held in a building owned by the Town Council. All of us had to sit for it. When it was over, my friends suggested we walk to a modest eatery in Yehuda Halevi Street. I was tempted to join them but decided it would be better to have a rest before we had to return in the early afternoon to sit for the Geometry Paper.\nHaving quenched my hunger, I went for a short walk. It took me to the District Court, housed in those days in a building adjacent to the examination hall. A long queue comprised spectators keen to follow a spectacular murder trial. To avoid the need of waiting, I entered another courtroom with a session in progress.\nThe accused were prosecuted for trading in smuggled refrigerators. When I took my seat, their counsel, a small middle-aged man with protruding eyes, was cross- examining a key witness. Jacob Keren was renowned for his down-to-earth manner and his persistent and searching questions. Further, his highly effective gestures and grimaces manifesting disbelief were effective. In no time he convinced everyone present in court that his clients were not hardened criminals, seeking to profiteer from unlawful trade practices. They were ordinary middle-class merchants. True, they might be guilty of some technical breaches; but their object was to compete with the prices offered by the government’s fat cows, which were exempt from taxes and import charges.\nI was so captivated by the proceedings that I came a few minutes late for our afternoon examination. During the next weeks I went over to the court whenever I had free time. After a while Jacob Keren got used to my presence. By the end of the year, I secured an attachment to his firm. Later, he became my pupil master.\n“Was my decision to opt for the law produced by the spell exercised by the courts?”\n“That too. The decisive cause, though, was your unwillingness to adhere to the course dictated by your mother’s nagging.”\n“Rebellion?” I asked.\n“To a certain extent. My own summing up is: the strive for independence!”\n“Plus, a friend’s subtle nudges?”\n“The less said about them the better.”\nI had no urge to view in detail my primary school days, suggesting that, instead, we take a brief tour. To start with, Theophil produced a screen showing how I ate my non-Kosher food during our school breaks, ignoring my classmates’ jibes and unfriendly stares. Our teachers, too, disapproved but adhered to the strict edicts against discrimination.\nNext the kaleidoscope showed my endless visits to medical charlatans, who were trying to cure my chronic asthma. Their unreasonable financial demands were patiently met by my loving parents. I was relieved when the screen turned to my involvements in activities of the boy scouts and to my first swimming lessons.\n“I’d like to show you your home: it was your cradle,” said Theophil.\n“More so than the school?”\n“I think so,” he replied.\nThe reek of stale tobacco offended my nostrils. Mother had been a chain smoker ever since she enjoyed her first cigarette whilst hiding in the bathroom in grandfather’s flat in Vienna. Our two rooms, in the flat in Melchett Street (shared with a childless couple), were plainly furnished. Father was struggling hard to keep us going financially. Mother assisted by running a table d’hote, which she had to close when the price of food kept escalating. Later, she accepted contract work from a textile factory. Her job was to eliminate faults left in the cloth by the loom. It was hard, poorly paid work, which made its demand on her eyesight. I recall her pulling one length of cloth up after the other, constantly tapping her cigarette against the ashtray.\n“How could she endure it?” I asked Theophil. “She was the pampered daughter of a rich Jewish merchant. She helped her father in his business in Vienna and managed his real estate for him. But she had never experienced manual labour!”\n“There was no other way out, Peter’le: and beggars can’t be choosers.”\n“If she had only given up smoking. What a difference it would have made to all of us – especially to me. Cigarette smoke was poison; sheer poison.”\n“She didn’t know any better. And your family doctor, too, was a chain smoker! The international campaign against smoking commenced in the sixties!”\n“Would she have stopped smoking, if she had found out it was harmful?”\n“She would have tried,” he told me. “But addictions are not easy to overcome. We can’t tell.”\nMy eye caught the affectionate face of Rudi Marx, who ran a secondhand book shop. That evening he came over to deliver a book ordered by mother. He also had a small parcel for me. When I took my new book out of its cover, a sheet of paper dropped onto the floor. It contained a typed copy of a terse entry from a diary. Don Quixote, it advised, was Sancho Panza’s demon.\n“An extract from Franz Kafka’s notebooks, edited posthumously by his friend,” confirmed Theophil. “I thought you ought to read it.”\n“I understand, Herr Rudi Marx. I didn’t realise you assumed his role that evening.”\n“I beg to differ,” he told me plainly. “You had by then sensed my presence, although your eyes were closed until that evening in the Vienna opera.”\n“Maybe. Still, most of the people I’ve met in life are Sancho Panzas: world wise, greedy and materialistic. But each of them had his quixotic dream.”\n“Such dreams kept your people going in periods of disaster. And Peter’le, I never stopped any assault on the windmills: broken bones are better than unrequited aspirations!”\n“I have to agree,” I affirmed. “Well, what was my mother’s dream?”\n“She wanted her only son to be a doctor. But she had to give up. Still, her real defeat was her realisation you did not love her.”\n“Why didn’t I? She was a good mother. Was it the stench of the cigarettes?”\n“That too; but you kept resisting her attempts to dominate you. In the process you lost your son’s affection for her.”\n“I loved my father!” I observed lamely.\n“He knew how to handle you.”\nI had no wish to re-visit other events from my primary school days. I could not help smiling when Theophil displayed scenes from our days as refugees. Mother’s prowess was evidenced by the scene she created when the Police in Marseilles proposed to press my father into the Foreign Legion. The Police Commissioner was relieved when she left the station accompanied by her husband and son.\nWe went further backward to the small pension in Chantilly. It looked drab and neglected when, years later, I revisited the posh racing town during a trip to France. It had looked grand and commanding to my little boy’s eyes. Another screen showed how I pulled a chair away when an old lady was about to sit down. Fortunately, she did not break her back. Father had thrashed me although the very idea came to me when he pretended to pull my own chair away. The incident left no doubt in my mind about human justice.\nThe next kaleidoscopic images took me back to Venice, where we had landed after our escape from Vienna, and to our refuge in Palermo. One screen showed my resistance of an attempt to convert me to Roman Catholicism. I knew that the family friend, who tried to persuade me to cross myself, was well meaning. All the same, I refused and burst into tears.\n“What stopped me, Theophil?” I asked my guide. “I know you did not intervene.”\n“Of course not,” he confirmed. “But I watched you intently!”\n“What happened?” I persisted.\n“Your mother’s expression was a bar. You still loved her then. But there was another element: your instinctive rejection of the unknown and an unwillingness to obey orders.”\n“What would have happened if I had gone ahead?”\n“That’s a speculation: a waste of time!”\nTravelling further back in time, we broke our trip to observe an event that had taken place in an orange grove near Palermo. Mother and our family’s friends had a picnic. Having wandered away on my own, I came across a saturated lime pit. Its white smooth surface appealed to me: I stepped onto it. Fortunately, I had taken just a few steps when I started to sink. Overcome by panic, I nevertheless managed to climb back to the brink. Mother – and everyone else at the picnic – was flabbergasted when I got back all covered in white lime and mud.\n“Why was this stupid antic so significant? I have recalled it – with terror – all these years!”\n“It was your ‘survival’ lesson. Your instinct was dormant till then. Children who fail to acquire it often die prematurely.”\nThe kaleidoscope screens lost their luster as we made our way back to Vienna. My recollections were hazy and far in between. One was of an outing in the Prater [Vienna’s Loona Park], where I was frightened by a brief show depicting the four seasons in the life of man.\n“That pretentious performance communicated to you the inevitability of death. No wonder it frightened you,” advised Theophil.\nAnother screen showed a rare antic of little Peter’le, some two or three years old at that time. To manifest his irritation with a guest who came to admire him, he opted for an act unique to small boys. Mother was shocked and the charming guest fled in dismay. I can’t recall her ever coming over again to our flat.\n“Good riddance to bad rubbish,” I told Theophil with a grin.\n“But did the end justify the means, Peter Gulliver?” he observed, not seeking to hide his merriment.\nIt dawned on me that Theophil was present visually only when he wanted me to see ‘him’. In other scenes, where he hovered around without materialising, his presence was not reflected in the screens recorded by the kaleidoscope.\n“I won’t materialise myself in scenes in which you did not see me when they took place. Further, up to now, I have re-played the past. Changing any detail in it retrospectively is too risky. Still, I’ll let you ‘sense’ my presence at your beginning.”\nMy mother, Dora Berger, was lying in her hospital bed in the Moll Clinic in the 1st District of Vienna. A uniformed nurse was bathing the newborn, ready to place him in his cot. He looked small, shrivelled and agitated. I viewed him with curiosity and sympathy: yet another visitor to our earth-crust who would seek to leave his mark. I was about to avert my eyes when I noted a blur in the background.\n“That’s my impact; the shadow alone is visible to you,” confirmed Theophil.\n“I understand. But what were you doing?”\n“Your mother smoked heavily during her pregnancy. I was cleaning your organs and vascular system. The small blood vessels in the brain required special attention.”\n“How about my breathing system?”\n“Too affected to be tampered with. In any event, I saw how asthma and a weak constitution were to be turned by you into an asset. So, I decided to leave well alone. You – my friend – have enjoyed bad health all your life!”\n“I understand” I said, noting with glee that, for the first time in our encounters, he described me as a friend. Deeply moved, I raised my last point: “But how did you work all this out years before it took place?”\n“Prescience,” he summed up laconically.\n“Is this then the end of the trip?” I asked after a lull.\n“I think so,” he responded. “Anything that happened before then is blurred, unformed. Still, I am sure the trips have given rise to questions. Care to raise any?”\n“Just one,” I told him. “Why was I so reluctant to re-visit my years in Israel – my youth. In reality, the sun was bright most of the time. So why did I recoil?”\n“Surely, you must know the answer.”\n“Most people recall their youth with glee,” I told him. “If a person wishes to cut it away with a sharp razor, he has a reason. His childhood or youth could be a matter of shame or of sufferings. But I can’t understand my own urge. There was nothing to hide.”\n“Not if put in these terms,” he agreed. “But Peter’le, let us outline the stages of your life.”\n“Early childhood in Vienna cum a few months as refugee in Italy and France. The rest of my childhood and most of my youth was spent in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. I then left Israel and spent the rest of my life in Anglo-Saxon and Asian milieus.”\n“Were you at home in these places?”\n“I was accepted as a respectable and civilized foreigner!”\n“And back in Israel – did you feel a man of the crowd?”\n“Not really. I interacted comfortably enough with my classmates. But their powerful East European Jewish milieu and outlook drove a wedge.”\n“So, you moved back to a fresh Diaspora: you exiled yourself.”\n“I did: it was easier to live as an odd-man-out away from Israel than within its realm.”\n“Which means, Peter’le, that you preferred your ‘alien’ existence to the making of the concessions anticipated from you in the country in which you grew up. No wonder you sought to escape from that period when you re-visited the past. You had no wish to concede that you were an odd-man-out all your life: not just abroad but also in your home country.”\n“But once I took the courage to look back, I was pleased with what I re-visited.”\n“Precisely,” he agreed. “You were relieved to realise that all in all you have been the same man throughout.”\nAs I reappeared in Pandan Valley – our family home in those days – Pat assumed I had returned from my trip. It appeared best to leave well alone. Hopefully, Theophil arranged for the payment of arrears in the rent for the place in Walton Street in Oxford.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novels/theophil/part-3/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"early-occupants\"\u003eEarly Occupants\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout a year after my release from the hospital in Singapore, I decided to fly over to Britain.

Although I had amassed wealth over the years, I had remained parsimonious.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Part 3: The Occupants"},{"content":"The prologue is followed by the debate between Job and his three friends. It would be tedious to go through each cycle of the debate because in essence only two points of view are set out: Job’s stand and the opposite outlook.\nJob’s position is clear, commencing with his lament: “I had no repose, nor had I rest, nor was I quiet yet trouble came” [3:25] and his bitter question: “[w]hy is light {meaning ‘life’} given to him that is in misery …” [3:20].1 Job accepts the existence of an underworld, Sheol,2 which is the destination of all mortals.\nIn subsequent speeches Job emphasises his innocence and states that he has not “denied [concealed] the words of the Holy one” [6:10]. He then exclaims: “I am fed up; I shall not live forever; leave me alone for my days are meaningless” [7:16, my translation]. He then points out that his sins, if any, do not affect God and enquires why he is denied forgiveness and a peaceful death.3\nJob continues in the same vain. In chapter 9 he describes God’s greatness and refers to him as the creator of “Hyades {the Bear}, Orion, the Pleiades and the South Wind Chambers” [9:9].4 This reference supports the view, to be discussed later, that the anonymous writer of Job was a Diaspora Jew.\nJob then voices his complaints, asserting that God crushes him “with a tempest, and multiplies [He] wounds without cause” [9:17]. In sheer bitterness he adds: “it is all the same. And so I declare: The innocent and the guilty he brings to [the same] end. While his scourge brings death to fools, He laughs [mocks] at the trials [sufferings] of the spotless” [9:22-23].5\nJob points out that there is no entity capable of acting as a judge,6 to whom he may complain and amplifies his bitter speeches by saying: “Oh that I had perished and no eye had seen me … I should have been carried from the womb to the grave” [10:19]. He adds that his days are numbered and that, in due course, he is to end up in Sheol from whence he would never return.\nConceding God’s omnipotence,7 Job disputes His being just (the “theodicy issue”). In Job’s opinion “the tents of the robbers prosper, and they who provoke God are secure” [12:5]. “He [God] leads counselors away [astray] bereft of counsel, and makes judges fools” [12:17]. Emphasising his innocence [13:18], Job asks God to tell him where he sinned and to enable Job to contend without being afraid of retribution [13:21]. Subsequently, Job expresses doubts about his three friends’ motive. “Will you speak wickedly [contextually: incorrectly or wrongfully] for God? And talk deceitfully for him? Will you show him partiality?” [13:7-8]. Asking his friends to remain loyal to himself, he says: “Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O my friends: for the hand of God has touched [torched] me. Why do you, like God, persecute me …” [19:20-21].8\nIt is difficult to translate Job’s bitter words. The tendency of translators is to soften Job’s pronouncements. The climax is in chapter 14, where he exclaims: “Who can tell the pure from the impure [tainted]. No one [can]”[14:4].9 It has to be conceded that this translation is based on rendering the word יתן[yiten] as “tell”. Traditionally, the words are understood as indicating that no one can produce pure humans from tainted ones.10 יתן is, however, closer to ‘tell’ than to ‘produce’.11\nWith these pungent words, echoed by the Ecclesiastes [9:2], Job reiterates his doubts about divine justice and, further, questions God’s capacity to tell observant disciples from transgressors.12\nNotably, God’s fallibility emerges from the prologue. Just as Satan questions Job’s motivations, so Job questions God’s justice and sympathy for the fallen. We also know from the prologue that Job’s misfortunes were not a retribution for sins but the fruit of a bet between the Almighty and Satan!\nJob’s bitterness is emphasised in subsequent speeches in which he treats God as being both unjust and merciless. He complains that God “has filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me” [16:8] and adds that He “tears me in his wrath, and hates me: he gnashes at me with his teeth” [16:9]. Seeking support for his unjust sufferings, Job exclaims: “O earth, cover not my blood … Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven and my testimony is on high” [16:18-19]13. Here Job calls on earth to be witness his having been wronged. His words may be an outcry. It is also possible to discern in them the influence of polytheistic creeds, which rank divine beings and which regard ‘earth’ as superior.14 Job also expresses his having been deserted by all who were close to him and berates his three friends. In desperation he exclaims: “Why do you, like God, persecute me, and are not satisfied with my flesh” [19:21].15\nJob adds [caps 23, 24] that his sufferings would prevent him from pleading his cause. In a sense he argues that an adversarial hearing is ruled out by his having been penalised before his guilt was established.16 He concludes this part of his addresses by affirming his innocence and his having been penalised unjustly [27:1-12].\nThe Qumran Scroll lends support to this analysis. It indicates that chapter 26 commences with an attribution of it to Job but does not comprise the first verse of chapter 27, which advises that the words that follow are further (or supplementary) words uttered by him. 17 In this manner, the Qumran Scrolls treats the first verses of chapter 27 as spoken by Job and as being a clear sequel to what he says in chapter 26.18\nIndeed, Job’s stand is crystallized in chapter 27, where he says: “Far is it from me that I should justify you: till I die I will not put away my integrity [innocence] from me. My righteousness I hold fast, and I will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me as long as I live. Let my enemy be as wicked, and he who rises against me as the unrighteous” [27:5-7]. These are not the words of a patient and penitent Job.\nThe approach of the three friends – Elifas, Bildad and Zofar – differs. Although the prologue tells the reader that they came to comfort Job [2:11-13], they turn out to be accusers. Their attitude is best captured in William Blake’s illustrations19 and is neatly expressed by Elifaz, who sets the tone for the ensuing speeches of the trio.\nTo start with, Elifaz rebukes Job for his doubts and asks “who that was innocent ever perished?” [4:7]. By saying this he hints that those who suffer (as does Job) are not innocent. Elifaz goes on and emphasises that God is just and raises the rhetoric question of can “mortal man be more just than God?20 Can a man be more pure than his maker?” [4:17].21 Praising God’s justice and might, Elifas opines that “man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upward” [5:6]. He urges Job “not to despise the chastising of the Almighty; for he makes sore, and binds up: he wounds but his hands make whole” [5:18].\nBildad’s opinion is similar. He observes that “God will not cast away an innocent man, nor will he uphold evil doers” [8:20]. In his opinion, Job’s only hope is to supplicate for divine help, for “… does the Almighty pervert justice?”[8:3]. He maintains that “if thy children have sinned against him, he has cast them out for their transgressions” [8:4].22\nNotably, Bildad does not treat Job’s offspring merely as a facet of Job’s property. He suggests that they perished because of sins. The prologue indicates that he is wrong. Bildad’s stance does not undergo any change in his second (cap. 18) and third (cap. 25)23 speeches.24 Likewise, the third friend – Zofar (caps 11, 20)25 delivers speeches reminiscent of Elifaz’s original stand. Both of them refrain from accusing Job of any specific transgression but take the view that only the guilty are penalised.\nIn the same way, Elifaz restricts himself, in his second speech (cap. 15), to implying that Job’s words manifest his guilt and tells us: “What is man, that he should be clean? And … that he should be righteous?” [15:14]. He concludes his speech by saying that evil people come to a bad end,26 and that God alone can determine a human’s purity.\nElifaz’ tone changes in his third speech. He is irked by Job’s firm rebuke: “Behold, I [Job] know your thoughts and the device you wrongfully imagine against me. For you say: Where is the house of the prince? And where is the tent in which the wicked dwelt?” [21:27-28]. Elifaz’s retort is equally harsh. He accuses Job of oppressing the poor and the helpless (the widows and orphans) [22:5 et seq.].\nThis is a shift in Elifaz’s language though not in his stand. In his earlier speeches he hinted that Job was guilty. He now raises the accusations which, as is known from the prologue, are unfounded.\nBy now it is clear that the friends’ stand is diametrically opposed to Job’s. The latter maintains his innocence and his having been wrongfully penalised. The friends’ approach is neatly summarised by Bildad, who asks: “How can man be justified with God?” [25:4].\nFor a similar lament, see Jer. 20:14-end, esp. verse 18.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nSee Part VIII and see Job 3:15, 7:9 and 14:13.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nFor an analysis of Job’ first speech, J.

Cp. Greenstein’s translation and comment, op. cit., at p. 85.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nAn issue arises in respect of chapter 26. The editor’s caption attributes it to Job.

Greenstein, op cit., at p. 16 suggests that the words just cited constitute part of Job’s first discourse. Again, I disagree.

The True Nature of the Deal Jack’s advice was sound. Although I had formed a reasonably clear picture of the background facts, I had come to a dead end. I had virtually decided to give the case a miss, when I had a stroke of good luck.\nCases to be litigated before a court in London were usually discussed with a member of a law firm, a solicitor. His task was to obtain the required evidence, to assess the basic nature of the case and to form an initial impression. When his work was done, the law firm referred the file to a barrister. If the latter thought the ‘cause’ was sound, he would prepare the case for trial.\nUsually, a solicitor refuses to provide any information respecting a case to outsiders. It is part of his legal training. Indeed, Seddon’s law firm retained its reticence. However, Mike Smith, the solicitor who had been in charge of Seddon’s file, had quit practice and became a business entrepreneur. From time to time, he came up to Oxford – his alma mater – in respect of a donation made by his new business to my college.\nWhen we met during a formal dinner in the Senior Common Room, Mike told me that Seddon had been a ‘full partner’ in Ng’s Hong Kong firm. Further, Seddon knew the supplier in China who had shipped the dust. Ng and his supplier took Seddon for a ride following a commercial dispute that had arisen between them. It related to the price of earlier shipments and to delays by Ng in making the payment due to his supplier as well as in the remittance of part of the ‘price’ to a Swiss bank account in Seddon’s name.\n“We thought it inadvisable not to refer to this matter when the case was heard by the High Court. You see, Peter, the transactions involved breaches of the Exchange Control Act. Seddon arranged to have the invoices made out for about twice the price of the goods. Ng and the supplier were to get what was due to them. The balance was to be remitted from Hong Kong to Zurich.”\n“Do you think Masterman Bank knew?”\n“They were not born yesterday,” grinned Mike\n“Why did they proceed with the transactions?”\n“Well, they wanted to ‘please’ a good customer. Further, Peter, they wanted to earn the fee payable when a letter of credit is opened by them! They are not philanthropists!”\n2. Further Investigations The fresh background facts intrigued me. Was it possible that many letters of credit were issued to disguise the illegal movement of funds out of the country? Here was I, a young lawyer from Tel Aviv, hoping to build a castle consecrating the law of letters of credit. But wasn’t I yet another starry-eyed researcher, who failed to see that his holy cow was nothing but a technique used to camouflage shady dealings?\nHoping to find out whatever remained unclear, I went down to London and managed to buttonhole Jacob Brown – the barrister engaged by Seddon. Sensing that he could trust me, he opened up.\nIt turned out that he, too, was aware of Seddon’s illegal design. Further, he was not surprised when the Judge rejected Seddon’s arguments.\n“So, it was a bad case. Wasn’t it?”\n“Touch and go,” replied Jacob. “And you know, Seddon’s usual legal advisers, Messrs L \u0026amp; K – a conservative firm specialising in international trade and property transactions – did not handle the matter themselves. They told Seddon ‘it was not their line of country’. They referred him to H \u0026amp; C – a well-known law firm specialising in commercial litigation.”\n“Didn’t the partners of H \u0026amp; C see the writing on the wall?”\n“Who can tell? Still, their object is to take cases on and – whenever possible – to make a profit. I was known as one of their ‘hawks’. The file was referred to me.”\n“So, the case was not altogether hopeless?”\n“As I already said, it was a ‘touch and go case’. It all depended on Seddon’s evidence. Did he rely on the Bank’s advice or did he simply give his instructions. That’s why I decided to proceed. In the event, the Bank refused to settle. And Seddon was destroyed in the cross-examination. He had to admit that he had not asked the Bank to advise him on details of the transaction.”\n“Who appeared against him?”\n“My good friend, Bernard. Another Oxbridge man.”\n“Why didn’t the Masterman Bank raise the issue of the exchange control contravention?”\n“To what end? They did not want to invoke the wrath of the Bank of England. They relied on the skill of their barrister. Bernard tore Seddon to shreds in the box: got him to admit he had had regular dealings with Ng for years. Bernard thought it best not to refer to the ‘partnership’ and illegality points.”\n“So, all in all, Seddon got what he deserved?”\n“He did, rather. And you know, the case ruined him. The shipment was worthless. The ensuing loss and the legal costs drove him into bankruptcy.”\n3. Jack Sums Up Jack, the publican, did not appear surprised by the facts I conveyed to him. To my surprise, he grinned when I mentioned the court proceedings. When I finished, he observed: “Look, Peter, that fellow knew his counterparty in Hong Kong. Still, before you make up your mind you ought to hear his version of the encounters with the Z Bank and the lawyers.”\n“I know. Still, on the face of it our Mr. X appears to be a naughty fellow.”\n“But why? Haven’t you yourself taken things through customs without declaring them? Have you never smuggled US dollars on your travels out if Israel?”\n“Of course I did. And I have hidden some income from our tax authorities. Most middle-class persons are guilty of such petty dishonesties. What I find ugly is our Mr. X’s attempt to recover his losses from the Bank.”\n“It is not nice. But you should find out what made him act in such a manner!”\n“Only one person can tell us,” I muttered.\n“Quite so,” replied Jack averting his eyes.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/worthless-goods/part-4/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"1-the-true-nature-of-the-deal\"\u003e1.

The sons and heirs took the fraud lightly and did not even attempt to get at the truth. To satisfy myself that I was not being drawn into a morass, I obtained a copy of the proceedings instituted by the prosecutor against Lena. It turned out she had confessed and her lawyer’s only task was to plead for a light sentence. The police did not attempt to trace the money. Indeed, this was not their task.\nFor a few days I reflected. I did not need a fee and could simply turn down the brief. My curiosity, though, had been roused. After an internal struggle I rang up the bank officer who opposed the idea of a settlement.\n“Sorry, Peter,” said Quentin as soon as he recognised my voice, “I am extremely busy these days. I do not have the time to train for the forthcoming Contract Bridge Tournament. I’ll have to give it a miss.”\n“I am not ringing you about this event. I, too, must take a rain check. I’ll be outstation when it is held. I am calling about a matter involving your former branch. I suggest we have lunch as soon as possible and – Quentin – this will have to be an off-the-record chat.”\n“How about tomorrow, Peter?” he chuckled. “And listen – old boy – I think I know what this is all about.”\n“So, our chat will be off the record! We are, in all probability, on opposing sides. Our confidential chat is contrary to the Law Society’s rules of ethics and to the Bank’s own policy.”\n“Of course: but don’t you worry! Both of us believe in leaving well alone. Obviously, you have grasped that something is wrong.”\nQuentin arrived a few minutes after me. The cosy restaurant, in the heart of the city, looked old fashioned. The slightly shaky tables were placed closely together so that usually the noisy speech of loud guests carried over. Still, the manageress had secured for me a table in a distant corner. True, the place was inelegant – a fact evidenced by Quentin’s expression. Still, the food was excellent and reasonably priced.\n“Well, what is on your mind, Peter?”\n“You had a very old and illiterate customer.” I went straight to the point. “Don’t you think he deserved special attention.”\n“I know all about the case you refer to. In essence, we were pacified by our awareness of the assistance the deceased got from Lena. She is – or rather was – an officer at another bank. This way we were ‘lulled into safety’. What do you think?”\n“How about the payment of cheques for large amounts over the counter?”\n“Lena was known to us and, usually, she muttered that the money was needed for some investments.”\n“I see. But there remains a question mark. How comes that you – from all people – decided to oppose a settlement? You are acting out of character!”\n“I investigated the case, Peter. Aren’t a few facts puzzling?”\n“Well,” I prompted.\n“To start with, didn’t the faked bank statements look pretty genuine? How about the colour scheme and the quality of the paper. They did look genuine to me!”\n“Was it then an in-house job? Thomas thought that digital made such fakes reasonably easy provided you had a good printer and camera.”\nFor just a moment Quentin hesitated. Then he went on unflinchingly: “I disagree. Even water marks were beautifully reproduced. The fakes were produced by an employee and I managed to unmask him. It will take him a long time to get another job!”\n“Didn’t the Bank report him? Was he prosecuted?”\n“Somebody higher up decided that his dismissal was good enough. We decided to avoid the unsavoury publicity that could result from a hearing.”\n“I understand; but then, why didn’t you recommend a settlement?”\n“Because Lena must have had an accomplice in the late Mr. Lim’s household. Someone who removed each original statement from the letter box and substituted the pre-prepared fake!”\n“I can think of but one person. The venerable Freddie, Lena\u0026rsquo;s adoring stepfather. He did have access to the letter box. But what would be his motive?”\n“The oldest one in the world,” Quentin asserted dryly.\n“Not curiosity, surely?”\n“Greed, Peter. Craving for a bit of an extra.”\nQuentin’s words made sense. Freddie stood to inherit the family’s home and one third of all the estate’s other assets, including the amount standing to the credit of the account. His own stepdaughter ‘milked’ that account. If part of her spoils had gone to him, then he would in addition be entitled to one third of any amount refunded by the bank.\nFreddie’s ill-gotten gains though would depend on the amounts paid to him by Lena. I had thought that the money stolen by her had ended up in her paramour’s account. On that basis, Freddie would have got a small amount. But this did not make sense. Why would he facilitate a fraud without making a genuine profit?\nQuentin looked at me keenly. He guessed my train of thought. His next words threw light on the outcome. “Lena’s boy friend got about $300,000. The accomplice at the bank pocketed a miserable $150,000. The balance was shared by Lena and Freddie. No wonder Freddie remains attached to our new prison convert: a model Christian! I am sure they’ll go to church together – arm in arm – when she is out!”\n“So, the true losers are the deceased’s second and third sons.”\n“So, it would appear. But who knows how much they got out of their dad when they bought their owns houses. In my books, Peter, family frauds usually remain undisclosed. Nobody wishes to wash the dirty linen in public. All in all, family Lim is united. Their bloody hope is to get an extra $2.1m. from the Bank. In the circumstances, Peter, do you still think I am ‘acting out of character’? Why should they milk us!”\nQuentin’s outburst surprised me. Had he himself been gotten at by members of his own family? Still, my present business concerned Lena’s defalcations. To clear matters, I observed: “I see your point now, Quentin. But how about the money that went to the Bank’s accomplice and to the paramour?”\n“We got the money bank from both the internal culprit and the boy friend. You see, Peter, the boy friend had an account with us. We used the rights conferred on us under the General Terms and Conditions vigorously: we debited his account.”\n“I see. So, in reality you got back $450.000. Can’t you – in the very least – pay these back? After all, you don’t want to make a profit from the family’s loss? Further, don’t you want to avoid the publicity of the episode. Its handling by the Press would not enhance confidence in the Bank!”\n“You have a point there. Let me think all this over,” concluded Quentin. “But Peter – on which point do they want you to opine? Just the validity of our existing terms.”\n“Quite,” I affirmed dryly.\n“Surely, you can do so without any issue of conflicts.”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ingenius-fraud/part-4/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eBack in my office, I felt that something was fishy.

Bearing in mind Hendra’s nefarious conduct, Freddie suspected that the case might involve money laundering.\nA few years earlier, the issue would not have been a cause for concern. A bank’s function was to receive amounts payable to its customer and to execute his payment instructions if he had the requisite balance. The position changed in the wake of terrorist activities in the United States. Under American pressure, many governments in the Western World passed laws under which a bank was expected to freeze amounts suspected of coming from dubious sources and to notify the reserve bank. The funds would be unfrozen only if cleared by it.\nThe Republic of Singapore passed the required regulations in 2002. The money laundering provisions required a bank to advise the ‘Authority’ when the bank had ‘reasonable grounds’ to suspect that funds remitted to the credit of a customer could be traced to, or linked to, terrorist activities or laundering of illegal funds. If a bank reported the receipt of such contraband funds to the Authority, the funds had to be frozen, and the customer could not be advised or ‘tipped off’. In consequence, the customer would not even know that the money involved was no longer available to him.\n“Freddie, do you suspect Hendra is involved in terrorist activities or is a money launderer?”\n“Surely that’s not the question, Peter!”\n“What is it then?” asked Norbert.\n“Freddie is telling us that the issue is the source of the money. If it’s black money, its payment to a numbered account in Switzerland would complete the laundering cycle.”\n“Precisely!” Freddie spoke firmly. “And look, I can understand why Hendra arranged for the remittance of the money to his account in Singapore. If he had asked his ‘payer’, or ‘remitter’, to credit part of the sum directly to the payee’s Swiss numbered account, the payer could work out how much money Hendra was making.”\n“So what?” I asked innocently.\n“In future transactions, the remitter might manage to discover the payee’s identity and deal directly with him.”\n“So why is the transaction suspicious?” asked Norbert.\n“The remittance is coupled with an instruction to pay a similar amount out. That is suspicious. Further, I’m sure that Hendra would not care too much about the source of money paid to him! In his eyes, money doesn’t stink,” said Freddie vehemently.\n“You are right about him,” conceded Norbert. “But then, Hendra told me he purchased some mobile phones cheaply and sold them at a huge profit. He rang me this morning to ask if his purchaser had paid up.”\n“What did you tell him, Norbert?” I asked anxiously.\n“I said I’d let him know as soon as the money comes in. I should ring him back before 4 o’clock. Up to now we haven’t credited his account. But look here, Peter: suppose we credit his account. Where is the risk? His balance will be short of the amount he wants us to pay out?”\n“But the very crediting of the money is prohibited,” interjected Freddie before I had a chance to answer.\n“Should we send it back then?”\n“You can’t do that. There is case law in point, Norbert.” I interceded.\n“So, what should we do?”\n“Credit the money to a temporary account, I mean a ‘suspense account’, which includes a reference to the transaction. It’s the only thing to do,” insisted Freddie.\n“Is it that simple?” asked Norbert.\n“I am not certain,” I warned. “If the suspense account is then frozen until the matter is cleared up, Hendra could get a court order diverting the money to another bank as soon as it’s unfrozen by the authority. It could then be too late to exercise a set-off.”\n“So, what should we do?”\n“Why not contact the Authority and ask for a direction?”\n“I did so earlier today. They advised me to refer the matter to our legal advisers,” chuckled Freddie. “Norbert rang you as soon as I showed him their email!”\n“So we are back at square one,” I muttered unhappily.\nWe continued to discuss the matter over our coffees. In point of fact, the Bank faced an impasse. To sort the matter out, I volunteered to call on a former colleague who had taken a post in the Authority’s legal department. Hopefully, he would give me a hint respecting the policy in cases of this type.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/matter-of-compliance/part-4/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHeaving a sigh, Freddie raised the issue of the funds remitted and Hendra’s order to pay out a substantial part forthwith.

Jack Smith, the plaintiff, had to be the first to present himself as a witness. Robert asked him the usual questions respecting his background, his experience in horse breeding and his reliance on the catalogue. He ended his examination by a set of simple questions.\n“So why did you rely on the John Brown’s statement?”\n“I have dealt with the sales house for years and have full trust in them.”\n“How about the auctioneer – Douglas Brown?”\n“I have known him for a long time”. Turning to the judge he added: “I thought he was a decent chap. And his statement was clear: he said the mare was with fowl.”\n“Did you ask for a copy of the certificate?” interceded the judge.\n“I saw no need for this, Your Honour. I was sure he was a gentleman and, further, could not imagine that the sales house would have any other type of man on its staff.”\n“No further questions,” concluded Robert.\nThomas Bardwell looked sombre. His own clients, Douglas Brown and the sales house, were accused of misrepresentation and misleading practices. These were serious allegations. Thomas had to convince the judge they were unfounded. The plaintiff, Jack Smith, was a reputable businessman and his word should not be taken lightly. If the judge accepted his version, the sales house’s reputation would be tarnished regardless of legal niceties.\nThomas was considering his line of attack. Since his years as a law student, he had grown from a heavily set but agile young man into a middle-aged man. His hair was receding and his sunken eyes and tired expression evidenced the constant stress of his work. Still, I knew he was taking his daily exercise and often spent some time in the gym. In comparison, Jack Smith looked bloated and under-exercised. I thought it unlikely that he spent much time riding his horses. And his beer belly suggested that he frequented pubs and clubs rather than stables. My friend and colleague, Robert McBride, appeared younger and more vigorous than either of them. Was it possible that his studious life and regular lectures kept him from aging?\n“Your interest in horse breeding is only a hobby, Mr Smith” started Thomas.\n“Quite,” replied Jack Smith.\n“Could you please tell us more about your other hobbies and main occupation?”\nTo my dismay, Robert rose to his feet and objected to the question on the ground that it was irrelevant.\n“I’ll withdraw the question then,” volunteered Thomas. “We have no wish to probe into the witnesses’ private affairs.”\n“I have nothing to hide,” interceded Jack Smith angrily.\n“The question has been withdrawn. So, it is no longer before us,” explained the judge.\nRobert had disclosed his weak point. On legal grounds his objection was sound: the question was not in issue. The question, though, was harmless and the judge’s body language showed that the episode left a negative impression on him.\nThomas’ reaction was swift. “Well, Mr. Smith, how many hours a week do you spend on your … horse breeding hobby?”\n“Most weekends and about two mornings during weekdays.”\n“Quite a major hobby, isn’t it?”\n“Well, yes.”\n“And how many horses do you have?”\n“Objection, your Honour. I don’t see the relevance of the question,” interceded Robert.\n“I’ll allow it,” retorted the judge. “Answer the question, Mr. Smith.”\n“About thirty,” replied Jack Smith.\n“Quite a large stable for an amateur, isn’t it?”\n“It is,” conceded Jack Smith with some pride.\n“And how may of them have you bought from my clients?”\n“This was the first. I know them from transactions in my main type of business. It is …”\n“Please confine yourself to answering the question put to you,” instructed the judge.\n“We’ll accept the answer on the question asked,” clarified Thomas. “And Mr. Smith, you read the catalogue.”\n“I did. That’s where I got the description of the mare.”\n“Did the catalogue say she was with fowl?”\n“It did not. Mr. Brown augmented the description in catalogue!”\n“Did you read clause 15 of the terms and conditions printed on the first page of the catalogue?” asked Robert, referring to the exemption clause\n“I did. But I did not pay much attention to it.”\n“Why?”\n“It is printed in every catalogue I receive!”\n“So, you were told not to rely on the descriptions in the catalogue. You were asked to examine the items you were interested in.”\n“I did not have the time to do so! Nobody does”\n“Your Honour, I ask that the second part of the answer be struck out or that Mr. Smith convey to us the source of his information.”\n“Mr. McBride?” asked the judge.\n“I agree this part of the answer be struck out,” yielded Robert.\n“So, you took a calculated risk, Mr. Smith,” pointed out Thomas.\n“But Mr. Brown made an express statement!”\n“What exactly did he say?” Thomas lowered his voice.\n“Could you please repeated the question. I wasn’t able to hear you.” Jack Smith sounded flustered. The judge, in turn, took notes of the incident.\n“Well Mr Smith, what exactly did Mr. Brown say?” Thomas raised his voice to its normal level.\n“He said the mare was with fowl.”\n“So now you can hear me,” noted Thomas. “Are you hard of hearing Mr. Smith?”\n“I am not,” replied an irritated Jack Smith.\n“I don’t see the relevance of this enquiry,” objected Robert.\n“Mr Bardwell has demonstrated that Jack Smith’s hearing is not perfect,” observed the judge. I heard the question well when first asked. I’ll allow the record to stand unless you establish its irrelevance later on.” Turning to Jack he asked: “Mr. Smith, was the room noisy?”\n“It was, rather,” conceded Jack Smith.\n“And how many dealings have you had with Douglas Brown?” asked Thomas.\n“None.”\n“So how comes you know him well and have formed opinions about his gentlemanly character?”\n“I have met him in clubs and have dined with him!”\n“Very well,” conceded Thomas, adding firmly: “and how much did you bid for the mare, a mare you had not viewed or examined?”\n“Three thousand dollars,” muttered Jack Smith.\n“A very substantial amount of a man’s yearly income, isn’t it?”\n“Not of mine,” protested Jack Smith. The judge, I noticed, raised his eyes from the notes he was taking. His annual salary, as we all knew, was in the vicinity of $10,000.\n“And you started bidding without having a look at the alleged certificate waved by Douglas Brown?”\n“True,” conceded Jack Smith.\n“No further questions,” said Thomas and resumed his seat.\n“You are satisfied Mr. Brown waved a certificate and alleged a veterinary had certified the mare was with fowl,” asked Robert, exercising his right of re-examination.\n“He did indeed!”\n“No further questions,” said Robert, adding: “this is the plaintiff’s case.”\nRobert’s statesmen indicated that he had resolved to rest his case on Jack Smith’s testimony. If his allegations remained unchallenged, Jack was in a powerful position. Thomas Bardwell’s task was to refute them. He was ready to rise, when the judge looked at his watch. As it was mid-morning, his Honour called a 15 minute break.\nThe first witness produced by Thomas was John Hicks, a store man and administrative clerk of the sales house. He confirmed that all communications respecting the mare had been between himself and its owner. The documentation related to the mare were all in a file. At Thomas’s request he produced the file which was thereupon treated as record submitted to the court and marked Def1 [Def exhibit 1].\n“Is there any document in Def1 which suggests the mare was with fowl?” asked Thomas.\n“No.”\n“No further questions”, said Thomas.\n“Could a certificate attesting the mare was carrying be handed to the auctioneer just before she was put up?” asked Robert. The judge raised his eyes. The question called for the witness’s conclusion on matter unknown to him. It was therefore contrary to strict evidence rules. Thomas, though, did not raise any objection.\n“I have no idea. Still, I was at the auction and would have taken a note and asked that the certificate by handed to me.”\n“On what do you base your assertion?” Robert McBride let his irritation show.\n“We follow certain procedures during auctions. If any statement made by the auctioneer is at variance with the catalogue description, we have the practice of recording it.”\n“Don’t tell me you never depart from practices,” Robert sounded victorious.\n“I have no recollection of having done anything like that for years,” John Hicks let his annoyance show.\n“Can you be certain?”\n“I am!” responded John Hicks.\nThomas did not find it necessary to re-examine. Instead, he put Douglas Brown on the stand.\n“Mr Brown, did you make any statement about the mare when the bidding started?”\n“I did,” answered Douglas turning to the judge.\n“What did you say?”\n“I read out a certificate, handed to me by John Hicks. It stated that one of the horses bred from her had won a minor race in Auckland.”\n“Please look through the file, marked Def1.”\nObediently Douglas perused the file. I felt confident that Thomas had trained him well. When Douglas raised his eyes, Thomas asked directly.\n“Did you make any statement about the mare carrying a fowl at the time of the auction?”\n“I did not.”\n“Did you wave any certificate and proceeded to sum it up for the attendants?”\n“Only the certificate handed to me by John Hicks.”\n“Are you certain there was no other certificate?” asked the judge.\n“I am, you Honour.”\nRobert’s attempts to shake or break the witness were futile. Douglas Brown stood his ground. I sensed that Robert was getting nowhere and, on top of it, was exhausted. Everyone in court, except himself, knew he had lost the case.\nThe proceedings were brought to their end by the judge. “I do not see the object of your line of questioning, Mr. McBride. The witness has made his position very clear.”\nFor the first time Robert looked deflated. “In that case, you Honour, I have no further questions.”\nThomas waived re-examination and, further, closed his case. All that was left, were the addresses to be made to the court by the counsel of the parties. Still, it was by then well past noon. The judge rose for the lunch break and advised that, unless the parties came up with a settlement, he would listen to their arguments when the Court resumed at 2.30 p.m.\nThomas Bardwell’s address was short. On the evidence, the ‘item’ was as described in the catalogue. He agreed that any misleading behaviour could lead to actions for misrepresentation or non-compliance with the Sale of goods Act. Here no such facts were established. To the contrary: the item put up for sale was described as a pedigree mare; and that was exactly what she was. The certificate on record did not establish that any incorrect description had been made. He asked that the action be dismissed with costs.\nRobert address in return was complex. He asked the judge to accept the version put forward by Jack Smith. He then analysed a substantial number of authorities which established that, if a wrong statement had been made, the sales house and Douglas Brown were liable.\nThe judge took notes but looked only marginally interested. Then, unexpectedly, Robert raised a new point. Even if the facts were as alleged by the defendants, the contract respecting the mare was null and void as it had been entered into under a genuine mistake made by the plaintiff, Jack Smith.\nInstantly, Thomas Bardwell was on his feet. He pointed out, vigorously, that to ‘mistake’ was not pleaded. Accordingly, this line of argumentation was precluded. Robert countered by an application to amend the pleadings. Thomas objected on the ground that this application was made at far too late a stage.\nFor a few minutes the judge wavered. Initially, he asked for further arguments on this point. Thomas was well prepared. Evenly but firmly he pointed out that the defendants should not be subjected to surprises. Justice in proceedings had to be observed. Then, as coup de grace, he cited a passage from Robert’s own book which suggested that an amendment could not be allowed once both parties closed their respective cases.\n“In any event,” interceded the judge, “the plaintiff claims monetary compensation. Does an action based on a mistake support such a claim?”\n“Not normally,” conceded Robert. “But if the mistake is linked to misleading dealings on the defendants part it can! In their absence it cannot!”\n“In this case what is the basis for application?” asked the judge.\n“An attempt to do justice!”\n“Which can be done if the defendants were guilty of a misrepresentation,” chimed in Thomas. “And this very question before Your Honour even if no ‘mistake’ is added to the pleadings at the last moment and without warning.”\nFor a few more minutes the judge hesitated. Then he disallowed the application, pointing it could be raised if the case was taken further up. Robert retorted that, in the circumstances, he had nothing to add. Thomas in turn waived his right to have the last word.\n“I’ll allow a coffee break,” said the judge. “I’ll deliver judgment when we resume in 45 minutes. All rose ad bowed.\nWhen the judge returned, he went directly to the point. He found Douglas Brown’s evidence reliable and preferred it to Jack Smith’s. He held that no misrepresentation had taken place and that the mare was as described in the catalogue. The certificate on file reaffirmed her being of a good pedigree but did not state she was with fowl. His Honour did not accept that any other information was provided by the sales house or Douglas Brown. Accordingly, he dismissed the case and ordered that Jack Smith pay the defendants’ legal costs.\nThe parties, the lawyers and the few onlookers milled out of the courtroom. As I made my way into the street I ran in Thomas Bardwell. He grinned at me and observed, nonchalantly, that it had been a nice experience to cite Professor McBride’s book against his own application. I could not help nodding sympathetically.\n“Weren’t you surprise he had not pleaded ‘mistake’ from the start?”\n“No, I was not. They wanted to keep the mare and, in addition, get damages. Don’t you think this was too greedy?”\n“The less said on the topic the better,” I told him and added: “But don’t tell me Robert was a poor teacher. I came over to enjoy his lectures. The class liked him!”\n“So did I. He was a clear even if somewhat dogmatic lecturer. Still, his place is in the ivory tower. In the courtroom he is out of his depth.”\n“You have a point there, Thomas,” I conceded and rushed off.\nFor the next few days I avoided Robert McBride. Twice I saw him on the mezzanine, checking books on the law of contract. I appeared best to return quietly to my office and to keep looking out of the window. The view was as fascinating as always. The harbour was beautiful. Still, the taste in my mouth was bitter. Robert had made a fool of himself and even failed to see what happened to him. If he ran into me he was bound to complain about the judge’s lack of understanding and the scoundrels in the sales house. I did not want to have to listen to such futile arguments.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/catalogue-description/part-4/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe trial, which took place some two months later on, demonstrated that, in the case in question, Robert was no match for Thomas.

Accordingly, the judge was entitled to review the documents before the hearing. A conscientious man like Morag would go ahead. In consequence, he would have a basic grasp of the case before the trial.\nThe more I looked at the documents the less easy I felt. Fischer had stated in his report of the accident that he had parked his car on the grounds at about 8.30 a.m. The car-park-attendant’s record suggested he had arrived half an hour earlier. I realised it might have taken Fischer time to find a vacant lot. Thirty minutes, though, suggested the car park had been near full. But could this happen early in the morning?\nAnother suspicious fact related to the accident itself. Fischer claimed it occurred shortly after he climbed up to the first floor. The affidavit of the workman, who had arrested his fall, stated that Fischer proceeded to the ‘accident spot’ on his way down from the 2nd Floor. A further perusal of the documents revealed that the 2nd story was, at that time, ‘still in progress’. It had not been ready for inspection.\nThe third oddity related to the plank that had given way. It was not part of the scaffolding and should not have been there. Labourers used it as a short cut when hopping from one part of the scaffolding to another. The workman’s report mentioned the plank had been loose. Obviously, the labourers took their chance when they made use of it. Fischer should have insisted that it be removed. Instead, he too stepped on it.\nMother looked with concern at my harassed expression. When I explained the problems, she thought they would be a good starting point for Fischer’s cross- examination. She was startled when I showed her Ruth’s instructions. She understood, instantly, that a genuine cross-examination was ruled out. She then asked whether such instructions were common.\n“Of course not, Mamma. But, you see, I am told Fischer is Ruth’s current boyfriend.”\n“I am not surprised. I saw them together in the theatre and in a restaurant. And you told me a lot about Fischer years ago. I am not surprised he is a Tachshit [ornament; slang for philanderer].”\n“I suspect that explains it. Are you surprised, Mamma?”\n“Of course not. And a fellow like Fischer would make use of an old maid like Ruth. I used to feel sorry for her when she came to concerts and shows unaccompanied. But Peter’le, could there be even more to it than that?”\n“What do you mean?”\n“Is Ruth entitled to give such instructions?”\n“Well, she is the Head of Rotem’s Legal Department. In this case, she is our boss.”\n“But doesn’t she have to clear such an odd instruction with her superiors?”\nMother searching question threw fresh light on the issue. At the same time, neither Rachel nor I were in a position to question Ruth. Still, Jacob Keren, the Head of our firm, was a non-executive director of Rotem. He could bring the matter to the attention of Ruth’s superiors by raising it at the next Board meeting.\nA further study of the file exacerbated my misgivings. Both the car park attendant and Fischer’s rescuer had no reason to lie. True, one or the other could have made an honest mistake. But could both err?\nI was, accordingly, inclined to believe them. But even so, I remained in the dark. Why would Fischer misrepresent the time of his arrival at the site? Further, why did he proceed to the 2nd story when the area was still out of bounds? Fischer was a cunning and unprincipled fellow. But he was no fool. What was he seeking to hide?\nDespite her effort, mother was unable to come up with any clue. One thing, though, became clear. Ruth’s instruction ruled out an attempt to get to the bottom of the matter during the hearing. She had played right into her boy-friend’s hand. All in all, the outcome depended on the delicate legal question.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/scaffolding/part-4/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eTo my relief, Boaz and Rachel  had agreed on a ‘bundle’ of documents.

The pleasant odours emanating from the kitchen, revealed Miri had prepared a sumptuous meal: she had mastered the art of cooking from her mother, who oversaw the kitchen in their Kibbutz, and had complemented her expertise by taking cooking lessons in Tel Aviv. Although I preferred mid-European and Mediterranean dishes to the East European cuisine, I always looked forward to a dinner at the Tamirs.\nBoaz grinned as I produced a small parcel, while he uncorked the bottle of white wine I had brought with me. “I hope you didn’t bring chocolates for Ruthi. They give her rashes.”\n“I brought her a doll.”\n“Eli,” chuckled Boaz. “Ruthi is getting too ‘old’ for dollies.”\n“And I’ve a book for Benji!”\n“Not War and Peace I hope.”\n“Don’t be silly: it’s David Copperfield.”\n“I’m not sure he’s up to it; he’s just had his 7th birthday.”\n“I expect great things from him!”\n“Thank you, thank you. But you won’t have to answer the thousand questions he’s bound to ask when he struggles through the book.”\nMy affection for Boaz’ young son had a great to do with his being a fellow sufferer. The asthma attacks I saw Benji fighting reminded me of my own, marred, childhood.\n“I hope he hasn’t had any attacks recently,” I ventured.\n“Not bad ones. But we had to call the doctor two weeks ago. Still, we hope he’ll snap out it when he grows up.”\n“He’ll have a better chance if the two of you don’t molly-cuddle him. But I know: it’s not easy. Well, time will tell: fortunately, he loves sports. That’s good; I hated them.”\n“Miri takes the brunt, Eli. Benji’s sickness is hard on her.”\nAt that point Miri announced dinner was ready. Except light conversation and gossip, little was said during the excellent meal. When we dug into the sweet – a pudding of dates and figs – Ruthi and Benji slid in from their bedroom. To my relief, Ruthi broke into a smile when I declared I got the doll because she was almost as cute as my little friend.\n“Uncle Eli flatters you like a big girl, Ruthi” Miri coaxed her.\n“And that’s a nice book, Benji,” affirmed Ruthi. “I’ve read it, Uncle Eli; and I like David: he was a brave boy.”\nWhen the children retired, Miri started to tidy up, rejecting the offer for assistance from the two of us. Boaz, I though to myself, had chosen well: a common sense, pleasant and straight wife like Miri was to be preferred to a spoilt glamour woman. With Miri beside him, my friend had gone from strength to strength.\nLeft on our own, Boaz and I started to gossip about our respective colleagues. We then discussed an address on the dangers of chauvinism we were preparing for a meeting of the Philosophical Society. Finding ourselves in agreement, we turned to what had been on the mind of each of us from the start.\n“Are Rachel and you in charge of Dahlia Nissim’s case?”\n“We are. Jacob Keren would not handle a case against Rotem personally.”\n“Just like Lordship Israel Silver. But we, of course, are expandable!’\n“You said it,” I consented. “But your client – is he going to resist the claim?”\n“Off the record – no; he isn’t! He wants to do the right thing by Dahlia!”\n“Off the record – how did this happen? How can a machine be both off and on?”\n“Faulty production, we suspect!”\n“Have you written to the manufacturers?”\nIt soon dawned on me that in this regard we faced an uphill struggle. The manufacturers – a well-known West German firm – relied on their manual and on the terms and conditions in the Standard Sale and Purchase order. They had warned purchasers that the machine was not to be cleaned or subjected to any maintenance procedures unless its own switch as well as the main switch had been turned off. They had also restricted their liability to the replacement of defective parts and had excluded ‘consequential loss’. In consequence, Boaz’ clients, Wollor and Franz Wolf, were pessimistic about an action against the manufacturers. It would have to be instituted in Western Germany and the outcome would depend on the law there prevailing.\n“Did you get an opinion from a German law firm?” I asked.\n“Franz Wolf did. The prognosis is negative.”\n“Even if the action was brought by Dahlia?”\n“I am afraid so. The German law in point is even more antiquated than ours!”\n“This suggests that the best way is to induce Rotem to pay.”\n“I think so. But then, we have to reckon with Mr. Ben Zion Vered. He will take the formal line of ‘no cover hence no liability’. I suspect we would do the same in his place.”\n“Rachel thinks we must find a legitimate argument to induce him to change his mind.”\n“She’s right, Eli. And it’ll have to be a sound argument. Ben Zion will examine any plea coming from the two of us with a powerful microscope.”\n“So where do we go from here?”\n“It’ll be best to go through the facts with Franz Wolf. We might come up with something. And I’m sure the two of you will get on fine.”\n“Because we are Yekkes?” I protested. “I’ve told you many times that Austrian Jews are not pure Yekkes!”\n“All right, all right; but he collects porcelain: so, the two of you share an interest.”\nMiri reappeared, wheeling in a pot of strongly brewed coffee and chocolates. Boaz produced a set of dominoes. Before long, the three of us were immersed in the game. As often before, Boaz and I ensured Miri won. Her childlike happiness made both us break into a smile. Knowing her well, I realised, at the same time, that something was on her mind.\n“Eli,” she said when we stopped playing; “why didn’t Rachel come with you?”\n“I asked her,” I told her, ignoring Boaz’ embarrassment at his wife’s directness. “But she said she wanted to finish some work.”\n“What was the true reason?”\n“I suspect she doesn’t like to advertise our … liaison.”\n“But that’s silly, Eli. Most of your friends know.”\n“Quite, Miri. But, you see, I keep proposing and she is stalling. Perhaps she doesn’t want to create an impression of a permanency.”\n“I think I understand … ” Miri cut herself short in response to Boaz’ expression.\n“I am not sure I understand Rachel’s stand, Miri. But, in any event, what on earth am I to do? I love her and want to share my life with her.”\n“Be patient. Rachel is concerned about the age gap between you.”\n“Also,” Boaz broke in, “she has two failed marriages behind her and fears another miss.”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ravages-of-a-guillotine/part-4/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eBoaz’ home was as welcoming as ever.

Having the Omri Tal case assigned to Justice Ehood Morag was an unfortunate development. Although Morag was a fair minded man and an excellent lawyer, his sympathy was bound to be with the victim of the accident.\nOriginally, Ehood Morag’s liberal orientation had come as surprise to the legal fraternity of Tel Aviv. Prior to his elevation to the Bench, he had been one of the leading advocates engaged by insurance companies in road and industrial accident cases. He was an accomplished cross-examiner. He had also been renowned for driving a hard bargain when cases were settled before trial.\nWhen his appointment was announced, insurance companies and industrials firms smirked gleefully. At long last, the Bench would be graced by an incumbent who could be trusted to see matters their way. Their jubilation, though, was short lived. Justice Morag’s philosophy bore no resemblance to the sentiments expressed by him in his years as an advocate. In that earlier role, he owed a duty to his clients. On the Bench his duty was to do justice. He made use of his first-class knowledge of the tight fisted, often unfair, attitude of insurance companies and of industry. He readily thwarted their untoward manoeuvres. In no time he became the champion of the cause of the little man, whose overworked and often poorly remunerated lawyer was no match for the skilled gladiator engaged by the business world.\nIn our case, his sympathy was bound to be with Omri Tal. This was the first handicap Hannah and I would face. The second hurdle, alluded to by Jacob Keren, was of a more personal nature. One of Ehood Morag’s passions in life was dancing. For years he and his charming wife, Varda, held the trophies awarded by the Tel Aviv Classical Dances Society for the Tango and for the Waltz. Eventually, they lost the latter to a younger, more sophisticated, couple. But they clung to the former. Indeed, Morag’s nickname in the profession was ‘the Tango King’! From all the judges in Tel Aviv, he was the one most likely to feel empathy for Valentino’s mental sufferings when his dancing career came to such an abrupt and untimely end.\nObviously, Jacob Keren wanted to see Morag off the case. The oblique instruction given to me was clear. Morag’s weakness was his hot temper and his inability to suffer fools lightly. On two previous occasions, his outbursts in reaction to stupid remarks of advocates were used as grounds for appeals against what were, in reality, well balanced judgments. Sending the cases back for rehearings, the Court of Appeal pointed out that justice had to be both done and seen to be done. How could a party to a case be expected to believe he had been given a fair hearing, when the judge had ridiculed and abused his legal representative!\nJacob Keren’s idea was to utilise the tension, which he knew existed between Morag and myself as lever for getting the case set before another judge. I was to use picador tricks to induce the Judge to charge! It was a daring stratagem, manifesting Keren’s trust in my discretion and tactical ability. But despite the hidden compliment involved, I was not pleased with the task allocated to me. I had developed a great deal of respect for Morag’s intellectual ability and trusted his integrity. I had no wish to sour the relationship, which went back to my second year in Law School, beyond repair. At the very same time, I feared to gain a bad mark from Keren for failing to carry out his instruction.\nAs I tried to decide how to deal with the Hobson’s choice fostered on me, I let my mind run through my years of interaction with Ehood Morag. Shortly after his elevation to the Bench, Morag was constituted an Adjunct Lecturer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In my second year of studies, I had enrolled in his course on the ‘Law of Civil Wrong (Torts)’ and admired the clarity of his lectures and the brilliance of his stimulating and highly imaginative analysis. Despite his acid tongue, I took his own tutorials in the course and discovered that Ehood Morag appreciated a good argument in class and was willing to consider novel and unorthodox points. In no time, I became his star student for the year.\nThe scene changed in my next year at the University when I enrolled in Morag’s optional course on Commercial Transactions. He took the course over for just one session to fill a gap created by a resignation of another lecturer. It soon dawned on me that Ehood Morag had no aptitude for the subject. He read his lectures out perfunctorily and evaded any intricate question raised from the floor. Indeed, my own understanding of some of the topics, gleaned during periods I had spent as a cadet in banks, surpassed my teacher’s.\nThe sensible reaction would have been to keep silent and to outshine the rest of the class in the examination. But I was a contentious young man and, in addition, chagrined to find that my idol had feet of clay! To give vent to my disappointment, I started to raise confusing points, asked daunting questions and made observations highlighting absurdities in Morag’s ill conceived analysis of the topic.\nEhood Morag was a fair man. Notwithstanding my boorish behaviour, I got a high distinction in Commercial Transactions. His Honour, though, had a long memory. When, after two years of articles in Jacob Keren’s firm, I was called to the Bar and started to appear in interlocutory matters, Ehood Morag gave me a taste of my own medicine. True, he listened attentively to each argument I developed and remained objective in his decisions. But he gave me a rough time whenever an opportunity presented itself.\nJacob Keren’s instruction provided a legitimate opportunity to turn the tables again. One inner voice whispered that I ought to go ahead. Another, more sober voice, counselled caution. True, Morag’s taunts and jibes were humiliating; but they had remained harmless. The same voice reminded me that Ehood Morag was a fine judge. Why should I damage his reputation and standing?\nMy chance to test the ground materialised some five weeks later, on an exceptionally hot day in late spring, when our application came up for hearing. As soon as Boaz Tamir and I took our appropriate seats on the two sides of the oblong table in the small conference room, Ehood Morag entered through the door leading to his Chambers. Having nodded politely when we rose to welcome him, he sat down unceremoniously and mopped the sweat off his brow.\nMorag leafed rapidly through the file in front of him. Although he was well into his forties, his deportment displayed the vigour of youth. Notwithstanding his massive head, which appeared out of place on his short and stocky torso, he projected the aura of upper-class elegance and self-assurance.\nWhen he was done, Morag closed the file and replaced the thick reading glasses he had been using with a pair of sleek, lightly tinted, spectacles.\n“Quite a neatly drafted application, Mr Berger,” he observed with a tight smile. “But you do cross all the T’s and dot all the I’s!”\n“An old weakness, Your Honour – not easy to shake off!”\n“I am not saying it’s a weakness. Still, it has a bearing on the length of your documents.”\n“In this regard, my Learned Friend is in the good company of Emanuel Kant and Karl Marx,” chimed in Boaz.\n“No wonder I never finished the first page of The Critique of Pure Reason. Quite a book,” observed the Judge dryly.\n“But, surely,” I retorted, trying to sound just as detached as the Judge, “the object of this first page is to warn off the casual reader!”\nEhood Morag, who was the Honorary Treasurer of our Philosophical Society of Israel, ground his teeth. Boaz Tamir tried hard to suppress a chuckle. He did, at the same time, give me a wink. Obviously, the first round went to me.\nThe next move was up to Ehood Morag. In open court, he would have followed the rules of procedure and asked me to address him in support of my application. In the less formal ‘camera meeting’ – where we did not wear our gowns – most judges tended to speed up the proceedings. In this spirit, Ehood Morag turned directly to the points that concerned him.\nTo start with, he instructed both of us to supply details of the other party’s alleged negligence. When that issue was settled, he turned to the main point of contention.\n“Mr. Berger, you request that the plaintiff supply particulars of his other hobbies or interests, if any. Isn’t that a fishing expedition? Why should he provide details of his personal life and interests?”\n“I agree that a ‘fishing expedition’ is improper in an application of this type, your Honour \u0026hellip;”\n“Quite,” observed Morag sternly. “Even in cross-examination a person’s private life should not be exposed more than is absolutely necessary.”\n“Of course. But my Learned Friend has opened the flood gates, if I may use the expression!”\n“How?”\n“In clause 24(3)(ii) of the Statement of Claim, which deals with the plaintiff’s loss of enjoyment of life, it is averred that ‘dancing constituted the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s main hobby and interest as well as a major source of pleasure and satisfaction”. Aren’t we then entitled to explore whether his other hobbies or interests will minimise or mitigate that loss?”\n“But why should that affect the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s claim based on the sufferings caused to him by the sudden end to his dancing activities?”\n“If your Honour has already decided that no other interest or hobby can mitigate the plaintiff’s loss on this count, our request for further particulars on the points in question ought to be denied!”\nStung by Morag’s dismissive tone, I had carried out Keren’s instruction. The angry flush that spread over the Judge’s face and the look in his eyes showed that the barb had gone home! Morag was about to erupt; but just before he did, Boaz Tamir stepped in.\n“Perhaps I could clear the matter up. The plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s only other hobby and interest is chess. He has played fifth and occasionally fourth board of the Emanual Lasker Club in national tournaments. We are prepared to provide the particulars, although I do not think they have a direct bearing on the count.”\nHis words smoothed the stormy waters. Ehood Morag’s face cleared and the fire went out of his eyes. Deliberately, he replaced his glasses again and pushed the documents to the corner of the table. I in turn, bestowed a grateful glance on Boaz, whose expression had remained immobile throughout. If he sensed how deeply I regretted my antic, he showed no sign of it.\n“Dancing and chess: not an ordinary combination, I suspect.” Morag was again his composed self. “I know nothing about chess. What is the Emanuel Lasker Club – something akin to our august Philosophical Society of Israel?”\n“In some ways – except that there are far more chess players than philosophers,” answered Boaz.\n“And how would you rate the Emanuel Lasker Club?”\n“It’s the best,” affirmed Boaz.\n“What then is this 4th and 5th board business all about?”\n“Ranking. First Board is top; fifth is the lowest.”\n“Is either of you gentlemen a chess player?” asked the Judge, showing a flicker of interest.\n“I’m pretty lousy,” I told him openly.\n“Ditto,” said Boaz. “My Learned Colleague usually wins six of every ten games we play!”\n“I though it was the other way round,” I said uneasily. “Still, neither of us would be invited to play for the Emanuel Lasker Club. They’d rather arrive short of one player and concede the set.”\n“I don’t understand,” said Morag testily.\n“If one of us played, a chess columnist might have something to say about the remarkable standard of the fifth player of club,” muttered Boaz.\n“I see.” Morag broke into a smile. “So why do you imply that the plaintiff’s achievements at chess are irrelevant?” he asked Boaz, adding uneasily; “but perhaps we should not touch on this. It has to settled in the trial. Unless you wish to discuss it informally.”\n“I do. Such a discussion is bound to be of considerable assistance,” opined Boaz.\n“I agree, your Honour.” My words gave the Judge the assurance that our deliberations would be kept out of the official record of the case. A breach of such an undertaking was unthinkable in our tightly knit legal community. A transgressor would become a pariah.\n“Very well then. Let’s proceed.”\n“The plaintiff’s performance as an amateur dancer was outstanding, Judge,” said Boaz. “As a chess player, he is mediocre!”\n“Do you agree with this analysis, Mr Berger?”\n“Our investigations confirm my Learned Friend’s statement. Omri Tal is unlikely to rise to second or even third board at the club: he ain’t a chess champion. Still, many people would be proud to play 4th board! If I may say so, Judge, I’d rather play 4th board in the Emanuel Lasker Club than be acclaimed a dancing champion!”\n“Quite a line for somebody who might make an exhibition of himself on the floor!” countered Morag dryly. Boaz Tamir chuckled. Obviously, the second round went to the Judge.\n“The matter has to be left for the trial. The Judge will decide the issue in reliance on the ‘objective bystander test’: would a young man like Omri Tal get over his ‘loss’ and enjoy other hobbies. Agreed?”\n“Agreed, Judge,” conceded Boaz.\n“So, anything respecting the ‘victim’s’ hobbies is relevant. Well then, let us turn back to our session,” said Morag, indicating the off-the-record discussion was at its end. “Unless you have an objection, Mr Tamir, I propose to grant the application.”\n“I have none, Your Honour.” Boaz reverted to the more formal form of address. “Still, I should like to reserve the right to serve a similar application. Can I have three weeks?”\n“Mr Berger?” asked the Judge.\n“I have no objection, Your Honour.”\n“Very well then. But, before we adjourn, I should like to ask why this case has not been settled. The liability issue, for instance, speaks for itself. Have the parties discussed it?”\n“We negotiated with the insurers, but reached no agreement,” explained Boaz.\n“May I ask the parties to have a further go? Even if no agreement is reached as regards the amount, a consensus on the liability issue is bound to save a great deal of time.”\n“May we have Your Honour’s tentative views on this issue?” I asked with some hesitation. “Copies of the main depositions are attached to the pleadings.”\n“Off the record?” Morag asked after a pause.\n“Of course,” said Boaz and I in unison.\n“Fifty-fifty as a starting point. What do you say, Tamir?”\n“I agree, subject to a variation of 10 per cent either way depending on the outcome of the cross.”\n“Berger?” asked the Judge.\n“Quite.”\n“So why not use 50-50 as a base for apportioning liability?” Morag trod carefully. “From the documents available to me at this stage, I cannot form any impression about the damages due under the different counts. Perhaps you could consider these as well?”\n“We’ll sure try, Judge” affirmed Boaz.\n“Can we then fix a date for the hearing – just in case you get stymied?” suggested Morag.\n“There may be a need for further applications, Your Honour,” I said apprehensively.\n“Depending on the ‘better particulars’?” asked Morag.\n“Yes, Your Honour!”\n“But in that case, we shall be unable to fix a date before the June break.” Morag spoke testily.\n“Also, Your Honour,” stepped in Boaz. “I appear with Israel Silver in a major industrial accident case, which has been set for the last week of this term.”\nFor a few minutes Morag was lost in his thoughts. When, at long last, he spoke, he let his disappointment show: “When the Registrar referred the case to me, we both thought it could be tried either before the break or at the very beginning of the next term. It now appears we were unduly optimistic. May I suggest that, if the parties wish to take any further procedural steps, they discuss them amongst themselves. Where each party agrees to the requests of the other, there is no need to revert to the Court. I’ll schedule the case for a pre-trial hearing in chambers in the second week of the next term. I shall be away during the first week.”\n“Very well, your Honour,” said Boaz. I, in turn, nodded.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/the-luck-of-valentino/part-4/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eBack  in  my minuscule office, I took stock of the situation.

Anna\u0026rsquo;s Change of Heart Anna was growing up. Occasionally she brought up subjects she had never raised before. Some related to human relationships. Others touched on faith and religion. Peppi recalled, in particular, a conversation they had one evening on their way home. They had been shocked to witness a van knocking a young man off his motorcycle. Once they had recovered, they continued their walk home. Then, unexpectedly, Anna asked: “Papa, does the Good Lord really exist?”\n“You ask two separate questions, my pet. One is whether God exists. The other is whether He is good.”\n“Our teacher says He exists and is good. She says He loves all of us. Is she right?”\n“Then why did He let this young motorcycle rider die on the road? The poor youngster was only four or five years older than you.”\n“My teacher would say we are too small to understand Him.”\n“Your teacher, then, must be grand: obviously, she claims to understand Him.”\nAnna did not reply. Instead, she looked sullenly at her father. The conversation, though, was the first sign of a change in Anna’s demeanour. Shortly after her fifteenth birthday, she began to distance herself from Peppi. She appeared to have lost her affection for him and remained aloof.\nInitially, Peppi assumed that his pet was growing up and her aloofness was simply a passing phase. Anna, though, continued to maintain this distance and, worse still, never smiled when he was around. Genuinely irked, Peppi asked her what the matter was. “Nothing, Papa,” came the reply, and Anna slipped out of the room.\nIn his frustration, Peppi turned to Helga but, again, drew a blank. “You can’t expect a young woman to go on acting like a little girl!” she said dismissively.\n“I know. This is what I keep telling myself. But often I sense that Anna is hostile, perhaps even afraid of me.”\n“Aren’t you just fancying all this?” asked Helga, still doubtful.\n“Am I a fanciful chap, Helga?” asked Peppi.\n“Not normally!” conceded Helga. “Alright, I’ll look into it.”\nSome two weeks later Helga resumed their conversation. She had raised the subject with Anna but got nowhere. Anna remained uncommunicative and elusive.\n“You are right, Peppi,” she told him. “Something is wrong; but I’ve no idea what it can be. You must remain patient. Sooner or later we’ll get to the bottom of it.”\n“It’s just awful: feeling that she doesn’t love me anymore!” exclaimed Peppi.\n“I don’t think that’s the case; but I can’t be sure. And you mustn’t apply pressure, Peppi! It would only make things worse. So be sensible,” said Helga. She then added, flustered: “It would all be so much easier if you were a believer. You would turn to the Good Lord.”\n“We’ve been through this many times. I won’t profess a faith I don’t accept!”\n“I’ll keep praying for your enlightenment,” sighed Helga.\nLater that evening, Peppi retired to his study, unlocked his safe and took out his special bottle. As always, the cork slipped out readily but the hearty swig did not bring him comfort.\n“I need your help, Theophil,” murmured Peppi. He had not beheld his metaphysical friend since that memorable day in Munich, when he saw him, principally, through the eyes of Dad. Occasionally, though, when he asked for help or guidance, a gentle voice responded in his head. In all previous instances it had counselled or proposed a solution.\n“I’m afraid there is not much I can do for you this time.”\nResignedly, Peppi closed his eyes.\n“Why, Theophil?” asked Peppi after a while.\n“All your previous ‘riddles’ could be solved by an application of reason. That, as you know, is where my skill lies. But I am no good at handling human emotion.”\n“I’ll have to be patient, then,” said Peppi.\n“Yes: take Helga’s advice,” agreed the voice in Peppi’s head. “But don’t look so crestfallen. Have a good look at the panel painting you purchased two days ago from the scruffy peddler, the one who calls on you from time to time.”\n“Judging from the motives and composition, it’s a 13th century work.” The connoisseur’s smile spread on Peppi’s face.\n“Have a good look at the lower left hand corner,” urged the voice.\n“It has been overprinted. I wonder what’s under it.”\n“Let me clean it for you.”\nAs if by magic, the ugly patch of dark paint disappeared. Using a piece of chamois, Peppi gently wiped the surface. When he had finished, his eyes opened wide. A diminutive image of a smiling Lucifer was staring right at him.\n“Albigensian?” Peppi was referring to a religious group that had thrived in Southern France during the 12th and 13th centuries. Unlike other factions of Christianity, they emphasised the inherent dualism of good and evil. When the Roman Catholic establishment’s attempt to convert them failed, the entire sect was annihilated in a crusade.\n“Albigensian, painted in Toulouse. This relic survived the first cultural revolution – the first ‘burning of vanities’ in the pious medieval world,” confirmed Theophil.\n“I gave that peddler just 300 marks for it,” sighed Peppi.\n“But that was what he asked for,” the gentle voice said soothingly. “And, my dear Peppi, we both know you’d never sell this piece. So – my boy – get a grip on yourself. As the British say: you win some, you lose some. Life was not meant to be a bed of roses.”\n“As our History Master used to say: everybody has a cross to bear,” conceded Peppi.\n“True, Peppi, except that I am not at all fond of the cross!” The voice chuckled, and then faded.\nResignedly, Peppi accepted his rejection by Anna. To escape the feeling of emptiness that descended on him from time to time, he spent many evenings in his office at Schultz \u0026amp; Stölzenfeld. Frequently – and although Lucy ran Theophil’s Antiques efficiently – he found excuses to fly to London. In due course, he became a familiar figure at Artiquar and a regular contributor to its quarterly.\nWhen he felt disinclined to spend the evening in the club, he scanned the entertainment pages of The Times. Like many foreigners, he had developed a penchant for British comedies and musicals. Occasionally, he went with Lucy to a show in the West End. After one such outing, as the two of them enjoyed a cup of coffee back at home, Peppi confided: “If your mother agreed, I’d make London my headquarters. London is nicer than Munich.” Lucy nodded, smiling.\nShortly after Peppi returned from one of his sojourns in London, Anna made an unexpected request.\n“Some of my friends are going up to Hamburg for a fortnight. Mind if I join them, Papa? The new term begins in three weeks and I haven’t had a break.”\n“Have you told your mother?”\n“She said it’s OK – if you agree.”\n“You will be careful, Anna, won’t you,” said Peppi anxiously. Although Anna’s playful demeanour had been replaced by a sober, mature countenance, Peppi was overcome by the protectiveness he continued to feel for his younger daughter.\n“Of course,” laughed Anna. “Papa: soon I’ll be seventeen! I’m not a child any longer!”\n“I know,” Peppi hurried to concede. “But you have never been away on your own for so long!”\n“It’s time I started – don’t you think?”\n“Very well then,” yielded Peppi, charmed by Anna’s friendly manner.\nAnna came back full of impressions. She admired Hamburg and Kiel and thought Helgoland was a “cute little spot”. Proudly she showed her parents a series of snapshots. Some were taken in front of places of interest, like the Michaelis Church in Hamburg. Others were beach and boating scenes. In some of them she stood next to a tall and good looking man who appeared to be a few years older than she. The smile on her face reminded Peppi of her expression when she used to sit on his lap in years gone by. He was not surprised when, a few weeks later, Helga told him that Anna was receiving regular letters from Hamburg and was writing back promptly.\n“Writing back promptly: that’s not like Anna,” said Peppi thoughtfully.\n“Young women act this way when they set their heart on a man,” answered Helga.\n“Who is he?”\n“He’s a student of theology. His name is Otto Schwartz. Anna is very much taken with him.”\n“Is it a passing crush?”\n“I’m not sure. She read me one of his letters. He sounds like a nice young man; and I think he’s steady. He expects to be ordained in a year or two.”\nShortly after she finished her Gymnasium and obtained her Matura [the Mid European Secondary School Leaving Certificate], Anna had a heart-to-heart with Peppi.\n“Papa – I want to talk to you about my future,” she told him.\n“Go ahead,” said Peppi warmly, marvelling, as often before, at the change in her outlook and appearance. His younger daughter had lost her frivolous interest in smart clothes and innovative coiffeurs. She had grown into a seriously minded young woman of character. Her neat appearance and forthright manner were bound to leave an impact on many a man looking for a dependable and presentable wife.\n“Papa, you will not like what I’ve got to tell you. Oh, I know you want me to enrol in a university; like Lucy did. But I’m not as smart as she and I am not interested in book learning.”\n“What do you want to do, then?” asked Peppi, bewildered.\n“I want to attend a school for professional secretaries, Papa!”\n“But why?”\n“I’m good at languages and I’m well organised. I can be of real use in a large company.”\n“Then why not study business management?”\n“Because I don’t want to run my own business and I don’t want to become an executive. I don’t want the responsibility.”\n“What, then, is your main aim in life?” asked Peppi.\n“I want to be a good wife and mother,” said Anna.\n“So the professional skills are to be a sort of insurance, I suppose?” asked Peppi lamely.\n“That too. But I may have to help my husband out for a few years.”\n“Don’t you see that this is unnecessary, Anna? If you ever needed help, I’d be there. Don’t you realise?”\n“I know, Papa. But I don’t want to depend on anybody.”\n“I see,” said Peppi, a lump rising in his throat.\n“And, Papa,” continued Anna, embarrassed yet determined to set all her cards on the table. “I want to enrol in the School for Secretaries in Bremen.”\n“What’s so special about Bremen? Why not Frankfurt or Hamburg?”\n“Mama told you about my friend Otto. He has just been ordained and constituted a curate in a protestant church in Bremen.”\n“I see,” Peppi repeated himself.\n“And the school is excellent; I’ve checked!”\n“Does your mother approve?”\n“She does. But I need your help, Papa. It’s a two year course; and it’s expensive.”\n“Very well then,” said Peppi. “And, Anna, best of luck.”\n“Thanks, Papa.”\n2. Helga’s Decline and Demise The large suburban house, which the Stölzenfelds had purchased shortly after Peppi became old Herr Schultz’s partner, felt empty after Anna’s departure. Peppi suggested that they sell it and move into a flat in an inner district. Helga, however, refused to hear of it. She loved her garden, felt at home in her large kitchen and hated the idea of living in the inner city. Peppi gave way gracefully. To ensure that Helga would not feel isolated, he decided to give London a miss for the time being. Helga, though, encouraged him to fly over from time to time.\n“You like London, Peppi. And I don’t want Lucy to feel cut off.”\n“But I don’t like the idea of your staying alone in this huge house!”\n“Don’t be silly, Peppi,” protested Helga. “Believe it or not – I can still look after myself.”\nThe trips to London revived Peppi’s morale. After some hesitation, he accepted an Honorary Stewardship at Artiquar. On his next visit to the English capital he joined a well-known dining club and after another few months purchased a share in an Austrian restaurant in Chelsea.\n“Lucy, can’t you persuade Helga to move to London or, at the very least, to accompany me when I come over?” asked Peppi one evening.\n“Mother will not leave Munich before Anna completes her course.”\n“But Anna has moved to Bremen; and I don’t think she’ll ever return to Munich.”\n“I know, Papa. But mother won’t listen.”\n“Then I’ll have to be patient,” sighed Peppi. “But you know, Lucy, next month I’ll be 72!”\n“You don’t look it, Papa,” soothed Lucy. “So stop talking like a septuagenarian.”\nIn the event, Peppi’s patience was not tested for long. One morning, as he was tiptoeing into their bedroom with two cups of steaming coffee, Helga did not rise to take the tray from him. Having placed the tray on his bedside table, he called out Helga’s name softly. She did not move. With a growing sense of unease, he nudged her, first lightly, then, when she did not react, more vigorously. Still there was no response. Peppi gingerly turned her on her back. One look at her face confirmed that she was dead.\n3. Peppie’s Credo After the funeral, Peppi and his two daughters had a quiet meal in a neighbourhood restaurant. For a while, each was lost in thought. Peppi was the first to break the silence.\n“I can’t live alone in the big house,” he said.\n“Why don’t you sell it and buy a flat near the shop?”\n“I thought you might like to have it,” he responded lamely.\n“I’ve decided to settle in London,” said Lucy.\n“I prefer Bremen, or even Hamburg, to Munich,” nodded Anna.\nOnce again there was a lull in the conversation. The waiter served dessert and coffee. Peppi sensed that Anna was eager to get away. Nevertheless, he felt the need to unburden himself.\n“I never thought Helga would go before me. She was only forty-nine years old.”\n“There are no guarantees, Papa,” observed Lucy.\n“I know: but it was a shock,” said Peppi. “My only comfort is that I did all I could to make her happy.”\n“But you didn’t accept the Good Lord,” said Anna sternly. “She craved for your conversion more than for anything else; and it’s not as if you didn’t know.”\n“Anna \u0026hellip;” started Lucy.\n“It’s alright, Lucy. Yes, I knew, Anna. But I am not a believer; and a conversion without faith is a sham. And I am not a hypocrite! Your mother would not have wanted me to pretend!” said Peppi. He did not flare up, but a distinct firmness crept into his tone.\n“Would it have been so difficult for you to accept a simple truth?” Anna snapped angrily.\n“What do you mean by that?” asked Peppi, ignoring Lucy’s imploring look.\n“I mean ‘faith’ – simple faith in God!” said Anna, unruffled.\n“I was unable to do this; just as others are unable to offer of a word of comfort when those who love them are down!”\n“Papa!” exclaimed Lucy, shocked.\n“No, Lucy,” Peppi had raised his voice. “Don’t try to stop me. If we must have it out it’s better that we do so now. I’ve swallowed a lot but I’m not taking this bullshit. Anna, what gives you the right to use your faith to criticise me? Who on earth do you think you are?”\n“I am only expressing my views as a believer – as a Christian. Why shouldn’t I? And what gives you the right to dismiss my views out of hand?”\n“I’ll tell you what gives me the right,” Peppi yelled. “In the course of two wars I have seen people dying around me like flies. Those who escaped unscathed were usually not the decent ones, not the brave ones, but the malingerers, the rogues, the racketeers. And how about plain civilian? Many poor or middle-class persons, who did not have the means to escape, perished. Worse still, I saw innocent men and women being dragged from their homes by the Nazis. And I don’t remember your fine church or any other unaffected religious group standing up for them. And this is not an isolated episode! Long before our own ‘enlightened’ days, some of the worst crimes in history were committed under the banner of one faith or another. As far as I am concerned the annals of all religions are soaked in the blood of murdered men and women. And I won’t throw my lot in with any of them! So don’t try to bully me, don’t patronise me and don’t offer me homilies. I have the same right to have my views as you yourself!”\nPeppi was breathing hard; his face contorted. But he did not regret his outburst: just for once he openly expressed views he had formed over the years.\nPeppi’s two daughters stared at him speechless. Never before had their father lost his temper or, indeed, spoken harshly to either of them.\n“I didn’t intend to bully you. Perhaps I should have held my tongue. But you always encouraged us to speak our mind and I thought you should know how I felt about \u0026hellip; about all this; I mean about mother’s sadness,” said Anna after a long, uncomfortable pause.\n“When she agreed to marry me, Helga new that I was not a believer. And I told her I did not intend to search for God. On this front I never relented: I remained true to my own convictions – my own creed. I was a good husband to her in all regards. Neither she nor you ever wanted or had any cause to complain.”\n“Neither of us would argue with you on this,” Lucy stepped in quickly. She was relieved to see that Anna nodded. “And I think we’d all better have a rest,” Lucy added.\nAs they rose, Anna told her father: “I didn’t mean to hurt you, Papa. I’m sorry if I did. I shouldn’t have spoken. If you feel you don’t want to support me any longer, I’ll understand. I think I know how you feel.”\n“I will of course see you through,” said Peppi. “But issues of religion and morals shall remain out of bounds.”\nThis altercation led to a change in Peppi’s heart. As soon as the estate had been probated, he put the family home on the market. Out of the handsome price it fetched, he purchased a comfortable two-bedroom flat a short walk from Schultz \u0026amp; Stölzenfeld. The balance he invested in a portfolio of blue-chip securities with a private bank in Zürich.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-devil-in-munich/chapter-4/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"1-annas-change-of-heart\"\u003e1.

The foundation was laid when, some three years after our initial encounter, Jacob Keren accepted me as a trainee. During the years I had spent with him, I learned much about the law and life in general. By the time I left Israel, I had – under Keren’s guidance – developed a penchant for rescuing losing cases. That gift stood me in good stead during my years in Wellington, in Melbourne and in Singapore. All the same, my greatest success as a lawyer remained the trial of Josephus Flavius in TA.1. Smilingly, I allowed myself to stray back to it.\nShortly before the day set for the hearing, the ‘parties’ held a short pre-trial conference. Pilkin had by then finalised his indictment and declared his willingness to abide by the current rules of procedure and evidence – as understood by us after numerous visits to the courts. Both the conference and the ensuing preparations went well. But two weeks later, we suffered a blow.\nOn our way to a new Pita Falafel stall, Pilkin told me that he had bad news: “We’ll have to finish our case by noon!”\n“But why – we were told we had the afternoon for argument!”\n“We still have it. But that football match between Tel Aviv and Haifa, the one that had been deferred because of the torrential rain, is now taking place on the day of our trial!”\n“So what?”\n“So all the chaps will run away during the lunch break and when they are gone the Girls’ll lose interest!”\n“Shit!” said I. “So what’s to be done? You have four witnesses! And we don’t start until 10.00!”\n“So let’s start at 9.00 and try to cut ourselves short!”\n“Oh, all right. But I still don’t see why some people prefer the sight of two unkempt teams chasing a filthy ball to the intellectual delights of a historical trial? Pfui.”\nIn the end, though, the constraint of time had a beneficial effect on my cause. After some wranglings, Pilkin agreed to call only three witnesses, one of whom would deal with both the charges of cowardice and unreliability. I, in turn, declared my intention to concentrate on the treason count. The others appeared trivial in comparison.\nTA.1’s function room was packed that morning. Some of the parents, who had come to watch the performance, bestowed supportive glances on me. My solitary figure – pitted against Pilkin’s full team – invoked their sympathy.\nAs soon as the “judges” took their seats at the elongated desk placed on an improvised stage, Pilkin opened the case. He read out the indictment and, as agreed, confined his opening speech to a description of the basic facts and the nature of the proceedings. I, in turn, confirmed that the defence was not calling any witnesses and advised that the main battle field was the treason issue.\nPilkin’s first witness dealt with the charges of poor military leadership and cowardice levelled against Josephus. In response to my questions, the witness conceded, that the other Jewish generals were equally poor soldiers. He then admitted that Josephus had not been guilty of cowardice in action. Josephus had put up a sturdy defence in Jodefet. It was sad that his courage had failed him in the hideout after the battle was over.\n“But weren’t some other leaders of the Revolt taken alive?” I asked.\n“Some were!”\n“So not everyone committed suicide when all was lost?”\n“True!”\n“And is a soldier expected to kill himself when the battle is lost? Is every prisoner of war a coward?”\n“I wouldn’t say that,” retorted the witness awkwardly. “But think of the heroism of our fighters in Masada!”\nPilkin nodded, smirking broadly. Little did he suspect that, unwittingly, the witness had laid the first brick in a structure I intended to erect for the defence. To clarify the issue I asked the witness to narrate the story of that last episode in the great revolt. Although the events were well known, everybody listened eagerly as the dramatic story unfolded once again.\nThe barren plateau of Masada, visible on the horizon from as far as Ein Gedi on the Dead Sea, had been turned into an impregnable fortress by Herod the Great, the last King of Judae. Under the vigilant eyes of Greek architects, his work force erected huge walls, encircling the rock formation which was, in any event, separated by natural crevices and deep ravines from the parched valleys far below it. In addition, Herod’s engineers constructed huge water reservoirs and vast granaries.\nDuring the great revolt, the stronghold became the quarters of an extreme sect led by Eleazar ben Ya’ir. His group of Sicarii used the prolonged hostilities in the Galilee and the siege of Jerusalem to replenish their supplies and to reinforce the mighty walls even further. When the rest of the country had fallen, majestic Masada was still unscathed and unaffected.\nFrom both a military and an economic point of view, Masada and the rebels stationed on it were of no significance. The trade routes to Egypt were not endangered. Practically, it would have made good sense to leave the hermits to their own devices. Under Roman law, however, the commander of the army was not entitled to celebrate his triumph until the enemy was vanquished. So Masada had to be taken.\nFor months the Roman army besieged the rebels. Again and again, the attackers were repelled. In the end, the Romans filled one of the deep crevices with gravel and rocks, constructed a ramp alongside the fortification, placed a battering ram on it and, despite the courageous resistance of the Jewish fighters, managed to topple the wall. They then burnt down a new wall lined with wood, which the defenders had erected during the siege and which could have withstood the shattering blows of the ram.\nThe end was now inevitable. To save his followers from captivity in Rome, Eleazar persuaded them to commit mass suicide. With the exception of two matrons, who hid themselves in a cave, all men, women and children perished at their own hand. When the Romans arrived next morning for the final showdown, they were confronted by corpses!\n“So that was the final act of heroism?” I asked the witness, who had moved the hearts of all those present with his well balanced and lucid narrative.\n“It was!”\n“How about the two women who hid themselves in the cave?”\n“I don’t approve of them. Still, in such a desperate hour everyone has a right to make his own decision.”\n“I agree,” I said with conviction. Then, emulating Jacob Keren, I concluded: “no further questions.”\nPilkin\u0026rsquo;s second witness provided further ammunition for my, as yet undisclosed, line of defence. His main accusation was that the long dead historian had used his great work as a vehicle for self aggrandisement. In his description of the campaign in the Galilee, Josephus had made extravagant claims about his own courage and attainments and had taken each opportunity to settle scores with Galilean leaders who had opposed him.\nThe assertions being true, I did not dispute them. Instead, I induced the witness to admit that Josephus’ War of the Jews and the Romans was not a mere ego trip. Josephus loved his people. His admiration for their courage and endurance were the main threads running through the work.\n“Let us assume that a stranger, with no prior knowledge of the conflict, chanced on Josephus’ book. What would he think of the Jewish rebels?” I wanted to know.\n“He’d consider them foolhardy and perhaps even fanatic!”\n“Would he think they were cowards, doormats and people without principles?”\n“Most certainly not! He’d be convinced they were men of immense courage and devotion!”\n“So Josephus did not ridicule or belittle our nation, did he?”\n“We do not accuse him of that!”\n“Suppose Eleazar had lived to tell the tale. Would he have given a more favourable account of our people as a whole?”\n“I don’t think so. Still, Josephus set out to aggrandise himself.”\n“Thank you. No further questions.”\nLike Pilkin and myself, the third witness came from the humanist stream. His keen interest in history and philosophy rendered him a force to be reckoned with. I listened attentively as he testified that Josephus’ surrender constituted treason. The ‘accused’ had failed to honour his suicide pact with the other survivors in the cave and, in all probability, had cheated when they drew their lots.\n“Did he act as a traitor in any other situation?” asked Pilkin.\n“He did indeed!”\n“Please tell us!”\n“During the siege of Jerusalem, after the fall of Jodefet, the Romans sent him, under a flag of truce, to persuade the besieged to surrender.”\n“No further questions,” said Pilkin.\nI knew I had to tread carefully. Feeling my ground, I induced the witness to confirm that Josephus had not committed any act of treason during the siege of Jodefet. The witness then conceded that Josephus’ attempt to persuade the defenders of Jerusalem to capitulate might have been motivated by his realisation that defeat was inevitable.\n“So, all in all, your charge of treason is based on one single act – Josephus’ surrender after the fall of Jodefet?”\n“Basically. But there is more to it than that. Josephus’ airs and orientation must be taken into account!”\n“They add fuel to the fire?”\n“Precisely!”\n“How important is that orientation,” I saw my chance.\n“Very important. It throws light on the accused’s motivation.”\n“But suppose someone else, say Eleazar, had been taken alive due to a coincidence?”\n“But, surely,” the witness sneered, “somebody like Eleazar is above suspicion!”\n“And why?”\n“His speech speaks for itself. A man who could use his words – express his sentiments in such a manner – isn’t and cannot be a traitor.”\n“You are satisfied of that,” I asked, hiding my jubilation.\n“I am. To demonstrate what I mean, let me read Eleazar’s speech out.”\n“Is that necessary?” asked the Chief Justice, a model student with a bent for mathematics, who kept glancing anxiously at his watch.\n“I have no objection, Your Honour,” I assured him. “Actually, it is still early in the day. I’m confident everybody will be in time for the great football match.”\n“Very well,” he agreed, sheepishly.\nLike everyone else in the room, I was moved by the speech, in which Eleazar persuaded his followers that death was preferable to the humiliation of captivity and to life as slaves in Rome. In their situation, Eleazar asserted, suicide was the only honourable course left.\nWhen the witness finished reading out the speech, I asked: “A man able to compose this speech cannot be a traitor – you agree!”\n“I do, indeed.”\n“You have read the speech many times?”\n“I have!”\nKnowing I was at home, I heaved a sigh of relief. “Kindly close the book,” I told the witness.\n“As you wish,” he retorted, bewildered.\n“Now, please recite the speech!”\n“What?”\n“I don’t see the object,” intervened the Chief Justice, equally startled.\n“I think I get the drift,” Shosh stepped in. “Let the witness proceed!”\nThe Chief Justice shrugged. The witness, in turn, squirmed but, at long last, admitted: “I can’t! It’s far too complex and long.”\n“I don’t blame you,” I assured him. “I too have read it many times; but I can’t repeat it. So, please tell me, how come we have this speech?”\n“I don’t understand!”\n“You read it out for our benefit – what is the source?”\n“It’s printed in our history book!”\n“But how did it get there?”\n“How do I know?” protested the witness.\n“Have a look at the footnote in your text! What does it say?”\n“The War of the Jews and Romans, book VII chapter 8, s. 6.”\n“So the source is Josephus’ great work?”\n“Well, yes!”\n“And who – would you say – composed this magnificent, patriotic, speech?”\n“Eleazar – surely?”\n“But Eleazar and all his men perished by their own hand!”\n“But those two women who saved themselves! They told the tale!”\n“But how could they recall and repeat this highly complex and elegant speech?”\n“Perhaps they had particularly good memories?”\n“But you yourself are renowned for your excellent memory and you have read the speech many times. Yet you can’t recite it. Do you really think that two terrified women, anxious to save their own skins, were in a better position than us to memorise and repeat it?”\n“Perhaps just the gist of it?”\n“Who then composed the present version, which moves the hearts all of us: the speech we consider an epitome of faith and courage?”\n“How can I tell?”\n“Think,” I raised my voice. “Josephus Flavius wrote in Greek and adhered to the Greek models of historical books. True?”\n“True!”\n“And who composed the speeches in most Greek histories? Thinks about Pericles’ speech in Thucydides’ work. Who composed the speech?”\n“I suppose the author?”\n“So who composed the great speech of Eleazar in the version that has come down to us – the magnificent speech you just read out – please think and be fair!”\n“In its present version,” the witness capitulated, “Josephus Flavius.”\n“And you have said: ‘A man able to compose this speech cannot be a traitor’!”\n“I meant the man who delivered the speech. But yes: I said so.”\n“Don’t you think that the fact that Josephus was able to compose this wonderful speech is circumstantial evidence of his real orientation?”\n“I have to agree with you.”\n“So doesn’t he, in the very least, deserve the benefit of the doubt, especially as the evidence against him is purely circumstantial?”\nFor a while the witness stood there, looking irresolute. He was about to answer, when Pilkin rose to his feet. “Your Honours,” he addressed the Judges in the legal jargon we had picked up in the courts, “my Learned Friend has shown that the evidence concerning the treason charge brought against the accused is not clear cut. It is equivocal. The prosecution takes the view that a man should not be convicted of a serious crime, like treason, unless his guilt can be proved beyond reasonable doubt. The defence has proved that this is not so in the instant case. We have, therefore, decided to withdraw the charge.”\n“Very well,” said the Chief Justice in a resigned tone, following a hushed consultation with the two other judges.\nBoth Pilkin and I made short closing addresses. By 11.30 the trial was over. The Court found Josephus guilty of the three remaining charges and undertook to deliver its grounds in writing.\nThe school’s usher – attired in a uniform befitting the occasion – announced the proceedings were closed. As soon as the spectators milled out of the hall, I stepped over to Pilkin’s corner and thanked him for his fair minded conduct.\n“Splendid performance, Bushi,” he countered. “Congratulations: one day you’ll be a great lawyer. But enough of that. Why don’t you come with us to the match?”\n“You too \u0026hellip;” I started.\n“\u0026hellip; Brutus? No, just a football fan! And it’s fun, Bushi. I’m sure you’ll enjoy it!”\n“How are you going to get to the stadium?”\n“Our greengrocer is giving us a lift. So how about it?”\n“I’d love to come,” I said.\nAll in all, I have to concede that the great football match, attended by all the boys including the ‘Chief Justice’, was enjoyable and, in its own way, exciting. I was amused to see how the seriously minded members of TA.1’s ‘Bench’ and of the ‘Prosecution’ cheered enthusiastically when either party went on attack or scored a goal. The goalkeeper, in particularly, was awarded ovations whenever he managed to stop a bombshell. I sensed that the opponents, too, had high regard for the opposition’s defence.\nMost spectators were either young men and women or entire families from different stations in life. As I looked around, my eye caught Jacob Keren, who was sitting in the VIP zone beside his wife and daughter. He was in shirt sleeves, plain trousers and wore a pair of spectacles lighter than those he used in court. He, too, waved his arms vigorously and showed his plain delight at the players’ skill.\nAnother aficionado sitting in the VIP zone was the very judge before whom Keren had argued the case heard by Pilkin and myself. Two of the venerable teachers of TA.1 were also present. Yet another attendant was the President of a charitable organisation – a fine lady in her mid-fifties.\nAll were gesticulating widely as they followed the onslaught of the two teams battling each other in the field. And – according to their respective affiliations – they cheered loudly and enthusiastically to support their respective protégés. To my own surprise, I, too, got carried away. It suddenly downed on me that I had become a member of the crowd.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/reunion-in-zermatt/chapter-4/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAs I stretched myself comfortably on the bed in Pension Kegel in Zermatt, I kept  musing on my days with law firms and in universities. The foundation was laid  when, some three years after our initial encounter, Jacob Keren accepted me as a trainee. During the years I had spent with him, I learned much about  the law and  life in general.  By the time I left Israel, I had – under Keren’s guidance – developed a penchant for rescuing losing cases. That gift stood me in good stead during my years in Wellington, in Melbourne and in Singapore. All the same, my greatest success as a lawyer remained the trial  of Josephus Flavius in TA.1. Smilingly, I allowed myself to stray back to it.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Chapter 4: The Josephus Trial"},{"content":"7. Employment and My First Marriage After the trip with Bushi and the culmination of the Suez Crisis I looked for a job. Financially, I could have stuck to my existing enterprises; they were sound. My ambition though was for a future on the stage. Bennie Ornan kept encouraging me to apply for a position in the army’s Entertainment Corps. He was convinced that my medical misadventure did not present an obstacle. I was, however, perturbed by the realisation that the Corps’ main object was indoctrination. I wanted to devote myself to art. For that reason I did not send feelers to TA.1. I knew that a teacher’s career was well paid and satisfactory. I knew also that, if I joined TA.1, Sheen would encourage me to perform shows. My ambition, though, remained the theatre.\nRegrettably, the major theatres in Tel Aviv were not recruiting. In any event, most of their employees were engaged on a freelance basis. I did not feel confident enough to start on such a basis: my name was unknown to the public. In the end, I accepted a contract for one year with the Signon theatre. It was not one of the major outlets but, then, I was hoping to use my first job as a springboard. In any event, the manageress, Nina Lasker, promised that they would consider me for any role that was not taken up by the regulars. She added that my main task would be to design props.\n“You are going to be the chief designer,” she said.\nWhen I asked Nina to show me to my room, I was surprised to hear that all they could offer was a labourer’s contract and I would have to be satisfied with a desk in the workman’s room.\n“But I may have to keep drafts of designs drawn by me for forthcoming shows.”\n“You’ll have to place them in your desk or in a locker. I can allocate you one.”\n“Oh well, I suppose this will have to do.”\nOn the very day I took up my appointment, Ronnie Eyal came to see me. He was a middle-aged man, tall and broad shouldered with thinning hair and piercing eyes. After telling me he was in charge of lighting and colour effects, he asked me to join the employees’ trade union. I executed the documents then and there.\n“You may need our assistance from time to time,” he smiled at me. “Nina is not particularly nice to employees, except to her pets. I suggest you be on your guard. Actually, what type of contract did she proffer you?”\n“A labourer’s contract. She said it was the only opening.”\n“It’s an old trick. I fell for it when she first engaged me.”\n“What do you have now?”\n“A dovetailed contract, which sets out my duties and privileges. I drew it up with the assistance of a friend, who is a lawyer. She tried to budge but had to give way: they need me.”\n“Do you think she has taken advantage of me?” I asked with trepidation.\n“You are a graduate of the Hebrew University, aren’t you?”\n“I am. And I had experience in staging when I was attached to the army’s Entertainment Corps.”\n“She should have taken these qualifications into account when she offered to employ you.”\n“Well, she didn’t. It’s a beginner’s contract.”\n“Oh well,” he sighed. “Get in touch with me if you need any help. I am in my room from 9.00 in the morning till after the last show.”\n“Don’t you go home for the lunch break?”\n“I have a quick meal somewhere here. You are welcome to join me if you have nothing better to do.”\nMy duties were not cumbersome. By and large, I had a free hand. Difficulties arose only when some actors wanted me to adjust the props to their needs. I made a conscious attempt to meet their demands but, generally, adhered to the author’s direction. One particularly annoying case arose when we staged The Good Soul [Woman] of Szechwan. Leo Shalev, one of the ‘regulars’, played the role of Shen Teh and Shui Ta. He asked me to install a staircase leading to the required podium. My explanation, that such a contraption would be too flimsy and unsafe, led to an altercation. Nina, who was summoned by Leo, asked me to comply with his wishes. Unexpectedly, Ronnie surfaced and, to my delight, stepped to my aid. Watching keenly his argument with Leo and Nina, I realised that they did not get on. To end the ensuing debate, I offered to incorporate a removable staircase but insisted that I would not be responsible for any mishap.\n“Leo is one of Nina’s pets. Be careful when you deal with him. He tends to take advantage and gets Nina to side with him,” said Ronnie as we left the scene.\n“Has he taken advantage of you?”\n“He tried; but in vain.”\nRegrettably, the installation culminated in an accident. As Leo mounted the provisional staircase, it gave way. Leo made a quick recovery but, as soon as the act was over, scolded me. Nina, who stepped in, became abusive:\n“So your staging cannot be trusted, Chayim,” she yelled at me.\n“You yourself, Nina …”\n“. . .Mrs. Lasker,” she interceded angrily.\n“Then you better address him as ‘Mr. Rosenne’, Frau von Lasker,” Ronnie Eyal, who joined us as Nina raised her voice, broke in. “And you have no right to abuse him. I was witness to the conversation.”\nFor a few minutes they kept glaring at each other. In the event, Ronnie Eyal stared her down. At this stage, I felt the need to react to her initial admonition: “As Ronnie points out, you, Mrs. Lasker, ordered me to comply with Mr. Leo Shalev’s request. I deny any responsibility: the fault is yours!”\n“Sorry,” she said after a pause. “I was too hasty. And please call me ‘Nina’. I regret my attempt to stick to formalities.”\n“I prefer to adhere to them from now on,” I retorted. “And when you engaged me you promised to find me roles to play. I have not been offered any during the three months I have worked here.”\n“You won’t see any,” Ronnie observed as we left the scene.\nRonnie and I became friends and before long were lunching together. Ronnie used to grab a sandwich in a nearby eatery. I led him to the nearest pita-falafel stall. In due course he became fond of the Israeli delicacy.\nDuring such sessions we tended to talk about modern literature and plays. Ronnie was knowledgeable and, in many ways, a harsh though fair critic. I started to tell him a great deal about my background, enterprises and years in TA.1. Ronnie was a good listener. However, he kept mum about his own past and attainments. The only information he volunteered was that he migrated to Israel in 1937 from Germany. All my attempts to probe were discreetly but firmly resisted.\nLife in the Signon theatre proceeded smoothly though rather monotonously. My only problem was Leo Shalev. For a reason best known to him, he regarded himself an authority on staging. Frequently, he tried to interfere in designs commissioned by the directors of given shows. Usually I managed to fend him off politely. Matters came to a head, though, when a director invited from overseas sought to revive in Israel the techniques used in Athens. Leo Shalev was incensed by the use of masks and of the Deus ex Machina device employed in the Greek theatre. He insisted that I discard them. On this occasion I refused his orders curtly. He left in a huff and to my surprise proceeded to Nina Lasker’s elegant office. Next day Nina’s secretary, Miri, rang to tell me that her boss wanted to see me. When I told Ronnie about it, he offered to wait near her office. He would step in if needed. He suspected I might be in for a stormy session.\n“Leo Shalev tells me you were rude to him, Cha…”\n“… Mr. Rosenne to you, Mrs Lasker …” I interceded.\n“But I asked you to call me Nina, didn’t I?”\n“And I told you that I wished to stick to formalities,” I retorted angrily, raising my voice.\nInstantly Ronnie entered the office, ignoring Miri’s attempt to block his way. Having listened to what had transpired, he insisted that Nina explain why my refusal to obey Leo Shalev was rude. Further, he insisted that if Nina demanded that I ignore the orders of the overseas director, she should issue her instructions in writing.\n“Many of us look forward to the revival of the Greek theatre in Israel. I know that Leo Shalev is your uncle and gets favoured treatment. But he has no expertise in directing and has not demonstrated any understanding of the Greek theatre.”\n“I only asked Ch…”\n“You meant Mr. Rosenne, didn’t you?” stormed Ronnie. “He is every inch as good as you.”\n“I only wanted to ask him to be diplomatic when he handles Leo Shalev,” she was now on the defensive.\n“What really did happen, Chayim?” asked Ronnie.\n“Shalev tried to give me instructions about the staging of a play in which he had no role. I told him: ‘No way!’ And I’d do so again.”\n“And you were strictly within your rights,” concluded Ronnie.\n“You could have told Leo to raise the matter with me,” said Nina as we departed.\nCulturally, the Greek play was a success. The critique was complimentary and, to my delight, one reviewer praised the skilful staging. Attendance, though, was poor: the play was a box office failure. When Ronnie and I discussed the matter we concluded that the Israeli public was not yet ready for a revival of Greek dramas. Classics were not taught in our schools. As already indicated, we concentrated on the Orient and on the Biblical Studies.\nI felt sympathetic when one afternoon Nina, who attended a rehearsal of another play, told me that her concern was not only in the artistic merits of our performances but also in their profitability.\n“Don’t you have the backing of a wealthy donor?”\n“I am afraid we haven’t. Our chief sponsor had to pay heavy fines to the American Inland Revenue Authorities and then went bust. Currently, we largely depend on our profits.”\n“I understand,” I told her.\nThis encounter with Nina made me realise the difficulties of her engagement. Still, I sensed that my future did not lie with the Signon theatre. I had no intention of spending the rest of my life as an underpaid employee of a second-tier establishment.\nAll the same, my remaining months with Signon were pleasant. I was thinking of sending a letter of resignation but then decided to discuss my contract with Bushi who was at that time finishing his pupilage in a well-known law firm. Bushi studied the contract carefully. He then pointed out that it was a one year contract. Signon had the option of offering me a new contract not later than after nine months following execution.\n“Well,” he asked, “have you worked there for nine months?”\n“Eight only.”\n“Then your best option is to wait for another month. If they don’t offer you another contract, your employment comes to an end automatically after one year with them. You need not resign. Still, under Israeli Labour Law you are entitled to two weeks of leave. See that you get it.”\nBushi’s words enlightened me. I concluded that it would be best to serve out ten or eleven months and then demand my two weeks of leave. I felt certain that that Nina Lasker would not offer to renew my contract.\nA few weeks later, when I was in the corridor, I was startled to hear a feminine voice screaming: “I wish I were dead!” Feeling alarmed, I entered the room and found Galya Hadar, one of our starlets, dishevelled and in tears.\n“I was only rehearsing my role,” she said evasively.\n“You did startle me,” I told her. “I thought this was real. And your tears – are they part of the role?”\nI was about to turn on my heels and leave the room when she beckoned me back. “No, Chayim, I was not rehearsing a role. I just can’t take it any longer.”\n“What is this all about?” I asked after a pause.\n“They always use me as a standby for major roles and then give me some minor part. And I know I can be more convincing than some of their famous actors. They are unfair to me. That woman, Nina, has her pets. If you are not one of them, she gives you a rough deal. I am really fed up.”\n“Then why do you stay?”\n“I want to remain an actress. If I leave, they’ll blacklist me. They have the upper hand; and they make no bones about it.”\n“Have you tried to move to another theatre?”\n“I don’t dare; and I really don’t know what to do.”\nFor a few minutes both of us were silent. Then, in an attempt to comfort her, I asked her to have a drink in a nearby bar. To my delight, she agreed to go out but suggested that a pita-falafel might be better than a drink. She knew an excellent stall, opened by a chap who called himself ‘The Desperado’. I agreed readily and, before long, we were on our way.\nGalya and I started to go out regularly. She took me to a number of first-rate and moderately priced oriental restaurants. After a while, I told her my story and listened to hers. She had finished two years in a well-known secondary school and then dropped out with the hope of making her career on the stage. Regrettably, she had limited success. Despite her confidence in having the required talent, theatre companies engaged her only in supporting roles. She had hoped that her position would improve when she accepted Nina’s offer to study major roles as a standby or locum. Regrettably, her performances when called upon to appear on the stage did not lead to stardom. She had remained a standby for the leading roles and her own performances remained confined to supporting parts. She was getting ready to throw in the towel but realised that she had nowhere to go. Rising in Israel without having gained impressive qualifications was a difficult task. She lacked the drive and the stamina.\n“What do you intend to do?” I wanted to know.\n“I suppose I’ll have to toe the line until I am ready to retire. My Mother left me a property and an income. But you, Chayim, what are your plans? I gather that Nina gave you an ordinary labourer’s contract.”\n“True. She said that was all they could afford…”\n“ … and, I am sure, promised to find you roles to play …,” Galya broke in.\n“She did, rather,” I conceded.\n“It’s an old trick: dangling a carrot in front of your face. It is her usual stratagem for getting cheap labour. Well, did she get you any role?”\n“She did not.”\n“And she won’t. You ain’t one of her pets.”\n“I am leaving after I have completed this one year contract.”\n“She’ll pressure you to stay. She might even find you a petty part before your year of service is over. But, in any event, where will you go?”\n“I have some business enterprises of my own. Also, I may accept a teaching job.”\n“The best way out, I think. You see, Chayim, your strength is in staging and in directing. The field, though, is overcrowded. Also, you may be excellent for certain roles. But I don’t see you becoming a celebrity. You are not an all rounder.”\n“How did Leo Shalev rise so high? He normally gets a lukewarm reception from the audiences and the critics are not impressed.”\n“He is Nina’s uncle. Originally, his name was Schulz. Nina is his older brother’s daughter. She married a fellow called Lasker – from the family of the famous Grandmaster of Chess. The marriage did not last but she kept her new surname. In her eyes, Leo can do no wrong, even when he borrows money left and right and never repays.”\n“Actually, Ronnie Eyal warned me. Did Leo get the better of Ronnie?”\n“He borrowed a small amount from him and ‘forgot’ to repay. Nina tried to bring pressure on Ronnie, arguing the money had been a gift. Well, Ronnie let her have it. His parting shot was: ‘mind your own business’. Nina blushed and did not reply.”\n“How do you know all this?”\n“I’m friendly with Nina’s secretary, Miri. She told me. I suspect Nina has been very careful with Ronnie from that day on. And I am pretty sure that Ronnie dislikes her.”\nAfter a while Galya and I asked Ronnie to have lunch with us. He was happy to join and in due course the three of became known as ‘that lunch club’. On one occasion Nina, who saw us, muttered that “the more you are together, the happier you shall be.”\n“True,” replied Ronnie, “especially if others don’t try to force their way into the circle.”\n“Why do you always tease her?” asked Miri unexpectedly.\n“Why ever not?” retorted Ronnie blatantly.\nThe episode surprised me, especially Miri’s attempt to shield Nina. Ronnie and Galya, in contrast, took the episode in their stride. The fact that a secretary sought to defend her boss did not strike them as odd. When the waitress placed the dishes in front of us, I voiced my astonishment.\n“Chayim, don’t be so naïve. Don’t you know that Miri and Nina live together? Nina shacked up with Miri shortly after Nina left her husband. Miri joined Signon mainly because she wanted to be with Nina all the time. Miri is a highly-qualified secretary. She could earn much more if she took up a job with a commercial company.”\n“I had no idea,” I conceded shamefacedly.\n“You, Chayim, are not particularly observant,” summed up Ronnie. “You know how to drive a hard bargain in business transactions but, all the same, fell for Nina’s rouse when she hired you.”\n“You may be right,” I replied, “but tell me: why is Nina so devoted to Leo? Occasionally, she harms him by allocating him unsuitable lead roles. There is something odd about this. On the one hand, she is calculating and looks well after the general business of Signon. On the other hand, she tries hard to do what she thinks is best for Leo. Something doesn’t add up.”\n“Actually it does,” stepped in Galya. “Nina’s father died young. He looked after Leo all his life. On his deathbed, he made Nina promise to carry on. Miri tells me that Nina took this undertaking very seriously. She is a loyal person by nature.”\n“I see. So this is Nina’s bright side.”\n“It must be,” added Ronnie. “I’m glad she has some good points.”\nGalya and I continued to go steady. When I told her that I was still living in my Mother’s apartment, Galya asked me to come and stay in her place. Her apartment was near Signon and she had one room too many. I was glad to accept and moved in forthwith. After a short while, we became intimate and decided to get married.\nI stepped under the canopy with trepidation. Traditionally, a Jewish marriage was meant to last. For most individuals of my generation it was a final step in their personal lives. Divorce was uncommon.\nAs was the custom, four Jewish male adults had to hold the poles of the canopy. A standard joke was the expression of hope that the holders of the poles would not become the pallbearers of the coffin of the spouse who was the first to succumb. I called on Ronnie, Bushi and two acquaintances from my Officers Training Corps. Galya wore a fine wedding dress, which we borrowed from Signon’s costumes coffer. It was actually selected by Nina, who was supportive on this occasion. I wore a tuxedo: the only time in my life I donned one. Leo Shalev assumed the orator’s role. He delivered a fine speech about the bliss of marriage and cracked a few jokes which he found amusing.\nA Jewish marriage was sealed when the bridegroom stepped upon and broke a glass placed just outside the canopy’s brink. I feared that one of the attendants might play on me the usual ruse of substituting a plastic glass. If the bridegroom failed to split it, he became the subject of ridicule. However, none of my friends played such a dirty trick on me. I recall that after the ceremony and the ensuing dinner – which was quite tedious – Galya and I were exhausted and fell fast asleep as soon as we were able to leave the crowd and retire to our bedroom.\nWhen I think about those remote days, I am satisfied that ours was not a passionate love affair culminating in a chemical marriage. We simply felt comfortable with one another and were glad to pool resources. From the start, Galya made it clear she did not want to bear children. They would stand in the way of her rising to a distinguished career on the stage. I found myself in agreement with her orientation. Both of us were young and so there was no need to hurry. With hindsight, I wonder if the agreement to remain childless for the time being was an indication that neither of us regarded our union as a final step.\nMy year with Signon was drawing to its close. Nina did not offer to extend my contract and, in any event, I had no wish to continue with them. Bushi advised me that I did not have to serve notice. However, he told me it would be appropriate to advise Signon that I proposed to take the last two week of service as my annual leave. Although this right had not been spelt out in the contract, it was a conferred on every employee under Israeli Labour Law.\nTo my surprise, Nina tried to resist. Initially, she told me that her intention was to employ me on a regular basis and that I was needed for the staging of a forthcoming play.\n“I am sure a Judge, dealing with this contract, would pay attention to my objectives. After all, I drafted the contract,” Nina told me.\n“My legal advisor tells me that a contract means what it says. A party’s hidden intention is irrelevant,” I replied.\n“But we really need you at this point of time. And you did not serve notice of resignation,” she averred.\n“The contract was for a one-year period. I am told that a notice of resignation is not required in such a case. And you did not offer to renew my contract by the time set out for this purpose in the contract.”\n“I had other things on my mind. I offer it now.”\n“I decline,” I told her.\n“So what do you really want?”\n“What I told you in my letter. I am entitled to have two weeks of leave.”\n“The contract makes no provision for leave,” she retorted angrily.\n“Our law does. I suggest you consult Signon’s lawyers.”\nIn the end, we compromised. I agreed to remain in service until the end of the contract and to accept two weeks salary in lieu of leave. Both Galya and Ronnie thought I had let Nina off too lightly. Still, my motto was: live and let live.\nFollowing this unpleasant encounter, I paid a visit to Sheen. He was delighted to see me and offered to employ me as a teacher. Initially, the contract was for one-year probation but, Sheen explained, this stipulation was a mere formality.\n“We can always do with a teacher devoted to the humanities. We actually need an extra hand for our Hebrew Literature and Biblical Studies classes.”\n“How about Talmud and Arabic?”\n“All in due course. And, Mr. Rosenne, Tichon is keen to expand its activities in the staging of plays. You were active in the field during your years with us. I trust that you have remained interested in the subject.”\n“Staging and acting have remained my main interests!”\nReturning to TA.1 was an exciting yet strange experience. People I used to address as ‘Sir’ or ‘Madam’ were now colleagues. Whilst Sheen insisted that we keep up with formalities, the relationship was that of equals. For instance, one of the outgoing Bible teachers talked to me without restraint about his retirement plans. When I was his student, such a topic would not have been raised, except possibly by an indication that his years of service were coming to their end. I also noted that some of the teachers I admired, even although I did not accept their views or orientations, had left or simply passed away. I was sad to hear that “Old Frank” had died in a car accident and that Mr. Klein, the Mathematics Master, opted for early retirement. In his view, parabolas and hyperbolas were more interesting than secondary school pupils.\nThose who left were replaced by newcomers, many of whom were graduates of our school. It pleased me to think that Tichon’s aura and ambience lured many back into the fold. By and large, there was little bickering and no in-fighting. It dawned on me that although Sheen was a hard task master, he was actually an accomplished and fair captain. TA.1 continued to go from strength to strength. It had attained top rank amongst secondary schools and its graduates were able to count on a secure future.\nOne of my first tasks was a revision of the Hebrew Literature syllabus. The old curriculum concentrated on the Hebrew writings of Diaspora Jews. Undoubtedly, their work paved the way for Israeli authors. My generation, alas, had to read these in private. I recall affectionately our reading sessions in Bushi’s home.\nWhen I joined TA.1’s teaching staff, I was effectively in charge of the syllabus. Without hesitation, I excluded much of the outdated literature and erudite essays, which dealt with the problems faced mainly by Jews in Eastern European countries. In their place, I covered the writings of some innovative Israeli authors. These included Medad Shif’s, Shim’on Tsahamra, discussing the issues faced by the offspring of a marriage of an Israeli girl to an Arab. Another was S. Yizhar’s Khirbet Khizeh, which exposed the expulsion of Palestinians from their land in the wake of the War of Independence of 1948. I also covered the writings of modern Israeli poets, including Avraham Shlonsky, Lea Goldberg and Nathan Alterman. Further, although I disagreed with J. Ratosh’s Canaanite orientation, I appreciated his polished style; and so I referred my pupils to his works. Notably, Sheen, who was even more traditional than I, supported my reforms. He thought that TA.1 ought to cover contemporary literature and social issues.\nIn my other main field, that of Bible Studies, I thought it prudent to adhere to the traditional exegesis. I was aware of Bible Critique, commencing with research undertaken mainly during the 19th century. Still, I found myself in disagreement and thought that interested people ought to be left to traverse this road independently. I felt – still feel – attached to the traditional approach to the Bible and did not wish to depart from the trodden path.\nGalya, with who I often discussed my work, took a different view. Whilst she supported the reform I introduced in Hebrew Literature studies, she thought my approach to Bible Critique was too rigid.\n“I know you reject Bible Critique; and your conclusions may be valid. Still, I think you should give your pupils a chance to proceed on their own. Why don’t you simply refer them to ‘further reading’? You may of course tell them that you disagree with the treatments mentioned. But why not give them the opportunity to investigate and make up their own minds?”\nOn further reflection, I adopted the approach recommended by her. Today, as an old man writing his autobiography, I am pleased with the outcome. Quite a number of TA.1 graduates left their mark in the field. It pleases me to think that my guidance might have been of some help.\nDuring my years as a teacher, Galya was a genuine support and comfort. Frequently, she gave me sound advice when I hesitated about grading a script. Further, whenever I was engrossed in marking compositions or exercises, she brought me cups of coffee and tea and generally did her best to lend me support.\nIn point of fact, I recall the entire period with affection. Intuitively, we apportioned our household chores. Being an accomplished chef, I did the cooking. Galya looked after the house. By the end of the year we found ourselves in a position to engage a part time helper who took a load off our shoulders.\nBy the middle of my first year of service, Sheen raised the issue of staging a play to figure in our end of year celebrations. Initially, we had some difficulty in spotting a drama which would fit into the scholastic calibre of our school and, at the same time, be acceptable to the Department of Education. To my surprise, Sheen considered staging Euripides’ Iphigenia in Aulis, in which Agamemnon sacrifices his daughter to the Pagan Gods so as to secure a favourable wind for his fleet. I was deterred by the challenge of finding a girl who would do justice to the heroine’s role, which involved the manifestation of Iphigenia’s internal struggle culminating with her courageous willingness to be the sacrificial lamb. I had further misgivings as I was not familiar with any translation of the drama into Hebrew. To my surprise, Sheen assured me that such a version was obtainable. I drew my own conclusion about the translator’s identity when Sheen’s eyes lost contact with mine. I further recalled his downcast expression when he had told us, years earlier, that TA.1 did not offer a course in Latin or Greek.\nAnother play we considered was Ibsen’s Peer Gynt. Both of us, though, were sad to conclude that staging would be too difficult. Further, we could not come up with the name of a boy who could play the role of Peer, the Norwegian man of fortune who returns home broken and destitute only to discover that his loyal wife has waited for him all those years.\nIn the event, we settled on a comedy written by an Israeli author of German descent (a Yeke), entitled King Solomon and Shalmai the Cobbler. It compared the lot of the wise king with that of a worldly commoner, with whom he swapped places for a while. Although the original was in German, the drama was translated into Hebrew by a leading poet. It was witty and easy to stage. Notably, the play has remained popular and continues to be performed frequently to the present day.\nWe had no difficulty in finding actors from amongst our pupils. The only obstacle confronting us was the lighting, which was tricky. I solved our problem by asking Ronnie Eyal, of Signon, to train one of our pupils. I am glad to recall the audience’s enthusiastic applause. Nina Lasker and Leo Shalev, whom I invited, were appreciative. I sensed that, despite my refusal to remain a member of Signon, I was remembered positively.\nMy next two years in TA.1 proceeded peacefully. I was a well-liked teacher and my classes both in Hebrew Literature and in Bible Studies were lively and, I believe, rewarding. In due course, Sheen asked me to take over the course on the Talmud. In addition, I persuaded him to introduce a course on Drama and Acting. Despite the initial resistance from some quarters I managed to have the course approved as an optional subject. As we already boasted courses on Art and on Music, our new option was in effect complementary. It became popular and, as anticipated, provided the ground for staging plays and dramas. A performance of Tevyeh the Milkman was one of our many successes.\nLikewise, my home life was comforting. Galya was supportive of my career and I helped her as much as I could. I recall spending hours rehearsing her. I do believe that my assistance triggered off her slow but continuous rise in Signon.\nMy brother, David, too, was doing well. Having completed his army service, he took up a job in the office of one of the international banks active in Israel. After a short spell with it, his employers transferred him overseas. In his first letter to me, he told me that he had met Clare Brown, who worked in the same bank. I gathered they were going steady. A few months later he advised me he had married Clare, who was expecting a child. He added that theirs was a civil marriage. David did not have the new born circumcised and, further, told me that his son, Dan, was going to be brought up as an Englishman. In due course David gave up his Israeli citizenship and became a British subject. Although he did not change his religion, he told me that he often went with Clare to an Anglican service.\nInitially, I was disappointed. I knew that, unlike me, David was an agnostic and remained within the fold ethnically rather than religiously. Still, I had always expected him to marry an Israeli girl or an English Jewess. On further thought, I concluded that once again nature had taken her course. The sexual impulse is dominant in all humans following their puberty. From the wedding photographs David sent me I gleaned that Clare was a good-looking girl. It was only natural that David was attracted to her. I hoped that their marriage would be happy and satisfying.\nA few years later, David wrote to advise me of the birth of their second son. They decided to call him William (Bill). I sent David a letter of congratulations but my heart was not in it. I feared that, in due course, David himself might leave our ever diminishing fold. Thereafter, my correspondence with him became sporadic.\n8. A Teacher in TA.1 There is not much to tell about my remaining years in Tichon. Naturally, I disliked the marking of essays, exercises and examination scripts. The compensation was the enthusiastic participation of my students in courses on drama and staging. We produced at least one play per year and I am proud to relate that some of our pupils proceeded to a career in theatre or joined literary circles. Some others became respected journalists and authors. Teaching them was a pleasure; and I do believe that in my own way I contributed to the development of Israel as a centre of the arts.\nA memorable event took place in my third year as teacher in TA.1. One of my pupils, Uri Barsel, asked me to stage ‘An Inspector Calls’. In this milestone drama, J.B. Priestly describes how the members of a wealthy middle-class family in England, who celebrate the engagement of the daughter of the house to the heir of a competing business, have wronged a working class girl. The eerie inspector, who arrives unexpectedly and who actually sits in judgment of all in attendance, discloses how a series of events, involving the members of the family and the daughter’s fiancé, have contributed to the working class girl’s suicide. In the centre of the play are two irreconcilable life philosophies. The head of the clan postulates that in a modern capitalist society everybody should be out for himself and need not have sympathy for the underdog. The inspector believes that the callousness of the wealthy classes is bound to lead to the emergence of a new society, in which people care for one another.\nI was moved by Uri’s constructive suggestion and recall our conversation vividly.\n“It is an excellent play, Uri, but I have two problems. First, I am unaware of a Hebrew translation. This has stopped Israeli theatres from staging it.”\n“My friend David, whose family migrated to Israel from New York, promised to help me translate it. And Mr. Simon, who is irked by David’s American English, will help us, Sir.”\n“That’s a fine initiative. I am pleased; but how about the second problem? I fear that the play, set by Priestly in 1912 (that is, before the outbreak of WWI), may not impact Israeli society. We have a Socialist government. So what are we to learn from an English drama, reflecting British society at the turn of the previous century with its inflexible class structure?”\n“But, Sir, was the English society really so inflexible? How about people like Horatio Nelson, Benjamin Disraeli and C.P. Snow? They moved upward despite their humble origins. And coming to think of it, Mr. Berling, the head of the drama’s clan, was doing all he could to climb further up.”\n“I take your point, Uri, but what has all of this got to do with us in Israel?”\n“But, Sir, is our society really egalitarian? How about the large Arab minority and the Jewish émigrés from Iraq and North Africa? Aren’t they being exploited? Many live on the poverty line in ramshackle old houses or in temporary shacks. And we, the established members of the Yishuv, treat them as second-rate.”\n“True,” I conceded; “but in Israel people can rise by their own boot straps. They are not constrained by a class structure. Rising is much easier here than in England of that time.”\nEven as I spoke, I kept thinking about my own career. I had managed to overcome obstacles and entered into the professional society emerging in Israel. In a sense, though, I was always able to face adversity. I knew I had to rely on myself. Unlike me, many pupils of TA.1 came from well-off houses. If they experienced difficulties with a subject taught in primary school, their parents were able to afford private tuition. Such luxury was not affordable by people of poorer means. I was a self-made man.\nUri, who was watching me keenly, added: “We could make the play topical in Israel by adding a sentence or two to the Inspector’s parting words. For instance, he could convey that the maintenance of a mobile or genuinely open-ended society is the task of the well off – the ‘fat cats’. What do you think, Sir.”\n“I like the idea,” I told him after a short reflection. “It is ambitious but we can do it. Still, it might be an idea to discuss the issue with our Principal.”\n“But … Dr. Joseph Katz …”\n“ … we called him Sheen when I was a pupil in this school …”\n“We still do; isn’t he strict and narrow-minded?”\n“We need his support, Uri; and actually behind the rigid image he portrays, Dr. Katz is an open minded man. And he is well read.”\nSheen was supportive. He obtained an adequate grant for the staging of the drama. Further, he perused Uri’s translation meticulously and suggested a number of constructive amendments, with the aim of enhancing comprehension and eliminating obscurities.\nI recall with pleasure the success of our performance. One of our guests was Bennie Ornan, with whom I remained in touch even after I had left the army. He praised our show and asked a number of pertinent questions about the participants. Later on, Uri was invited to join the army’s Entertainment Corps. In due course, though, Uri opted for a business career.\nNowadays, in my old age, when I reflect on the staging of the drama, I cannot help feeling that Priestley’s utopian society has remained a dream. It is true that a welfare state replaced the structured society criticised by the author. This refurbished state, though, is constantly exploited by the very people whom Priestley sought to shelter. The working force is heavily taxed so as to meet the dole payouts and the costs of other social expenses the state now bears. In reality, the strict division between the wealthy and the poor remains a cause for concern: a plutocracy has superseded the society that preceded it. Before long, artificial intelligence and robots may lead to rampant unemployment. What will come thereafter? I am unable to predict.\nThese depressing thoughts emerged as I aged. During my years as teacher, work and home life were enjoyable and so I contemplated staying in my then post. The hope of a career in an Israeli theatre was waning. All in all, I felt no need for a change. The Almighty or (if we accept my friend Bushi’s philosophy) Fortuna had different plans for me.\nHowever, I must not jump the gun and so I turn back to my youth. As already indicated, my last years in TA.1 were even more enjoyable than my first period. The students were aware that my main interest was in the theatre and in Hebrew literature. I recall with glee how Uri called on me after a Hebrew Literature class and asked me to peruse a ‘scribble’ which he attributed to one of his friends. In reality it was an excellent short story, dealing with the life of a Sephardic Jew whose girl friend was a European (Ashkenazi) and whose family objected to the union. I came up with a number of suggestions respecting style and grammar. The narrative, though, was impressive and reflected hidden prejudices that remained in existence in our emerging, allegedly open ended, society.\n“Tell your friend I approve. He is talented,” I told Uri.\n“I am convinced he will be delighted to have your endorsement.”\nAnother delightful event took place about a year later. One of my pupils, a highly spirited girl, suggested that we stage Medea. She told me she was able to play the heroine.\n“But do you really want to take on this role? How would you feel about Medea’s murder of her children by Jason, just so as to spite him for having scorned her? I can think about quite a few ‘old hands’ who would shy away.”\n“I know,” she told me. “But then, Sir, that horrid act is not shown to the audience. I can live with the innuendo.”\nInitially, Sheen was lukewarm. He feared we were over-extending ourselves. Further, he doubted if the powers above him would give the green light. In the event, he overcame his doubts and gave us his support.\nAnother problem surfaced at this point. None of our students wanted to play Jason. Those I approached told me that, in their eyes, Jason was a despicable character. In Colchis, he seduced princess Medea who, acting out of love, aided him to steal the national treasure: the Golden Fleece. Back in Corinth he abandoned her in order to climb the ladder by marrying into the royal house.\nIn sheer desperation I asked Uri to take the role. He thought the matter over and finally agreed – provided we added to the script one line, in which Jason expresses his hope that his rise in Corinth may improve the future of his own children by Medea.\n“You are seeking to adapt the play for performance in our modern society,” I told him.\n“This, indeed, is the object. Also, it makes Jason a more realistic character. We turn him from a villain to a man who seeks to secure his offsprings’ future. And, Sir, this is not the first time fresh blood is injected into an ancient masterpiece.”\nThe performance was a success. TA.1’s reputation as a secondary theatre was slowly but surely establishing itself. I was proud and pleased.\nAs the years passed by, I became well-entrenched in my position. I was no longer the new appointee, who had to feel the ground. After four years of service, Sheen asked me to become Deputy Principal. By then, most of my old teachers had retired or simply moved on.\nMy students, too, kept changing. I recall the farewell party given by Uri’s Form. I was invited as guest of honour and thoroughly enjoyed myself. I sensed that the young boys and girls I had been teaching grew into young men and women. Their generation would, in due course, have a say in the selection of Israel’s leadership.\nMy home life, too, remained satisfying. Galya was moving upward in Signon. Nina allocated her some fine supporting as well as lead roles. Naturally, Galya’s rise entailed extra work on my part. To start with, I had to help her rehearse. Galya was not blessed with a good memory, which meant that my role in aiding her to remember lines became cumbersome. Still, it was a work of love and so I did not complain. Another, less satisfactory feature of Galya’s rise, was that I had to carry on more chores at home. Our helper (Ozeret in Hebrew) became indispensable.\nAll these years I maintained my close friendships with Ronnie Eyal and with Bushi. The latter proceeded with further studies at Oxford. I knew that he might not return to Israel. I recall our parting, in which I reminded him of our rendezvous in Zermatt. Another person who left Israel was my brother, David. Initially, he had assured me that he intended to return home but I had my doubts. I knew that David’s outlook was less patriotic than mine.\nIn contrast to both of them, Ronnie Eyal remained stationary. He took the view that any Holocaust victim who managed to migrate to Israel ought to remain faithful to his new homeland. He disapproved of any person who ventured overseas and remained there when he found the pastures in his new abode greener than back in Israel. He thought that such a person was a deserter.\nA highlight of that entire period was Uri’s wedding. Initially, he and his fiancée contemplated a civil marriage. They knew that such a wedding could not be celebrated in Israel. Their idea was to travel to Cyprus, establish temporary residence there, be married by a Justice of the Peace and then return home and apply for recognition of their status to an Israeli court. I knew that, basically, their plan was feasible. Still, I had misgivings.\n“Uri,” I told him, “isn’t your bride Jewish?”\n“She is, Mr. Rosenne. However, both of us are members of the Canaanite movement. We don’t want to celebrate our union before a Rabbi.”\n“I didn’t know you have become a Canaanite.”\n“Actually, you, Mr. Rosenne, provided the lead.”\n“Eh?”\n“I know you are traditional. But you directed us to Ratosh’s poetry. I read and admired it. I then went to his political gatherings. Before long, I joined the movement. Actually, that is where I met Rina. I also met your friend, Eli Berger.”\n“What a small world,” I expostulated. “But – as you may know – Bushi went for further studies overseas. And, Uri, I am not a follower of Ratosh, although I admire his poetry.”\n“But that is irrelevant. We may disagree in our political orientations. Your Hebrew Literature classes, though, enlightened me. But, look here: you seem to be uneasy about our plan. Is there any practical reason for this?”\n“Actually, there is. As you undoubtedly know, marriages are no longer as stable as they used to be. Regrettably, many end in divorce even if the relationship was excellent at the beginning. If you married overseas, an Israeli court would hold your marriage valid. I have no doubt. But dissolution would be problematic. I really hope your marriage will be successful and everlasting. But we do not know what the future holds for us. And bear in mind that the Rabbinate has the power to dissolve any Jewish marriage but not a civil marriage celebrated overseas.”\n“Is this your only concern?”\n“Actually, it isn’t. You see, Uri, Judaism is not merely a religion. It also involves an ethnic affiliation. Adolf Hitler, may his name be cursed, emphasised this point. If you fly overseas because you don’t want to celebrate your day here before a Rabbi, you take a step in the direction of relinquishing your source. As you know, I have read Ratosh carefully and am satisfied that, if you embrace his political views, you cannot be a Zionist. All the same, and like Ratosh, you remain – and always will be – Jewish. Don’t try to sever the link.”\n“We’ll have to think about all this,” he conceded.\nIn the event, Uri and Rina had a traditional Jewish wedding. I carried one of the posts of the canopy under which they stepped. Now, after the lapse of so many years, it pleases me to relate that Uri’s marriage flourished. I attended the circumcision of his son and visited Rina after she delivered a girl. Both children settled well; they have good careers. Uri attended the weddings of both of them. They married young and so he had the fortune of seeing his grandchildren. Regrettably, he had a stroke in his sixties. I was, at that time, in the United States. All I could do was to send Rina a letter of condolence.\nA major political event that took place whilst I was teaching in Tichon was the Six-Day War of July 1967. It was initiated by Nasser, who ordered the United Nations observers to leave the Sinai Peninsula and closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping. Our government treated this as an act of war.\nNowadays it is accepted that the preemptory strike of Israel’s air force led to our victory. Further, I am convinced that King Hussein of Transjordan made a grave error when he started warfare despite Israel’s attempt to avoid hostilities with him. In the event, he lost the entire West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Syria, which also stepped into the arena, lost the Golan Heights, from which its army used to fire shots at Israeli Kibbutzim in the Galilee.\nMy unit was involved in the fierce battle of Latrun, which the Jordanian army sought to retain. We won, had very few casualties and remained in that neighborhood until the ceasefire. After the culmination of hostilities, the entire West Bank as well as the Sinai Peninsula was in Israeli hands. When I returned to my post in Tichon, my colleagues and students gave me a hero’s welcome home.\nI recall with glee the day I visited our holy places. During my student days, West Jerusalem was Israeli domain. The Old City, including all Christian, Jewish and Muslim shrines, was governed from Amman. Before 1967, Israelis were barred from our places of worship. Having free access to them after the War filled me with joy.\nWhen I look back at this fateful war, I conclude that, in its own way, it created new problems. The Muslim world was humiliated and was bound to seek revenge. Nasser admitted that it had been an error to start a war for which Egypt was not prepared. Surprisingly, though, the Arab countries rallied behind him and induced him to withdraw his resignation. He remained in office till his demise.\nThe main problem caused by the war was migration. About three hundred thousand Palestinian Arabs fled to neighbouring countries where they were treated as refugees. I am, further, convinced that many of them were chased away by our army and that atrocities were performed by some of our men. I am proud to confirm that my own men did not commit any.\nThe new wave of Palestinian refugees (and their sufferings) has remained a thorn in Israel’s flesh to the very days of writing. It strikes me as ironic that our people, who had existed as a Diaspora for centuries, initiated a new wave of homeless people. In effect, we did to them what others had done to us.\nAnother wave of migration resulted from the surge of anti-Semitism in the Arab world. Since the War of Independence of 1948, the existence of Jews in the Arab countries had become precarious. Many left at that time. The Iraqi Operation Magic Carpet, which enabled Jews to fly from Iraq to Israel, enhanced the migration process. Israel had to absorb the wave of migrants.\nAn additional catalyst for the migration of Jews from Arab countries was the shameful Lavon Affair of 1954. Jewish-Egyptian sympathizers were induced by Israeli intelligence to plant time-bombs in American and British owned premises in Cairo. The object was to cast the blame for the explosions on the Muslim Brotherhood and other ‘unspecified malcontents’. The unveiling of this operation led to a wave of anti-Israeli and anti-Semitic feelings. In reality, the distinction between Israelis and Diaspora Jews became blurred. Many Egyptian Jews, who had stayed put until then, migrated to the United States or Israel. Our victory in the Six-Day War exacerbated the situation.\nUp to this point, I had dealt with the unwholesome side effects of the Six-Day War. It would, however, be unrealistic to overlook the advantages incurred by Israel. First, Israel gained territory which had been inaccessible until 1967. In particular, Israel took control of the entire West Bank. Second, the War secured free navigation of Israeli vessels through the Straits of Tiran. Ships flying the Israeli flag could thereafter sail to the Indian subcontinent and to Australasia without circumnavigating Africa. Third, the conquest of the Golan Heights protected Israeli settlements from fire opened at will by the Syrians. In the fourth place, the victory boosted Israeli morale and endorsed the capacity of our soldiers. I do believe that both Israelis and Diaspora Jews were proud of our achievements.\nYet another, far less obvious outcome of the Six-Day War, was that Israel obtained dominion of sites housing the Dead Scrolls. Until 1967, Khirbet Qumran – the habitat of the sect that produced this treasure – was part of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Thereafter it fell within Israel’s effective domain. I recall vividly and with pleasure the day Uri invited me to join a visit to this meaningful site. The visit was exhilarating and eye-opening. In a sense, Israeli archaeologists were now free to investigate what used to be out of bounds.\nI am aware of the fact that the Scrolls have led to controversy. My personal assessment differs from the enthusiasm displayed by people like Uri and my life long friend Bushi. Where the text of a Scroll differs from the Jewish Masoretic Text, I adhere to the latter. All the same, whenever I visit Jerusalem, I make a point of visiting the National Library and spend most of the time in the Shrine of the Book, which houses these precious documents. Due to their fragility, the Scrolls on display are rotated. Still, in the time available to me I am usually unable to read everything on display.\nBack in Tichon, life continued in its usual, satisfactory, flow. Then, unexpectedly, a new venture surfaced. Two girls of one of my classes asked me to conduct an extra course on Modern Israeli Literature. They pointed out that the materials prescribed in our syllabus did not do justice to the ongoing development of Israeli literature. I had prescribed some texts but many books had to be read outside school hours.\n“I have given you references to leading new works,” I pointed out.\n“But this is not the same thing as going through them together systematically.”\n“I am not sure that an extra course would be sanctioned,” I observed sadly.\n“Both of us are members of a club, which allows us to use its premises. Let people come on a voluntary basis. We are certain that pupils from other secondary schools will grab the opportunity.”\nSheen pointed out that such a course would be extra curricular. At the same time, he encouraged me to go ahead. He, too, took the view that a new literary culture was emerging in Israel.\nThe meetings were timely and successful. To start with I emphasised that in these gatherings all participants were of equal standing. It was therefore appropriate to drop formalities. Initially, some youngsters found it difficult to address me as ‘Chayim’ rather as ‘Mr. Rosenne’. However, it did not take them long to adjust.\nThe first book we discussed was Moshe Shamir’s He Went Through the Fields. It deals with the love affair of two members of a Kibbutz: an Israeli-born youth (a Sabre) and a girl who migrated from Europe after the Holocaust. The author brought to the fore the clash between the values of the member of the Old Yishuv and of a girl brought up in a European milieu. The tome also dealt with the expectation of the ‘establishment’ that new ascendants (Olim) would discard ‘alien values’ and embrace the doctrinal approach of the Kibbutz. One of the attendants of the course was critical of the narrow mindedness and the contracted horizon of the Kibbutz’s society.\nOur gatherings became regular and we covered quite a number of modern novels and poems. I recall our analysis of Aharon Megged’s The Living on the Dead, in which a Young Man – of Uri’s generation – is commissioned to write the biography of one of Israel’s pioneers. In the course of his research the author discovers the skeleton in his hero’s cupboard. In consequence, he refuses to complete the book. Many details of the fictive author’s personal life and of his divorce are covered in Megged’s book.\nWe enjoyed a lively discussion of the book and of the gap between the young author’s generation – the Young Generation – and the idols of the Yishuv’s early days. Uri and Rina, who attended, postulated that the apparent difference between the generations was nothing but the demarcation between the pragmatic approach of a politician cum pioneer and that of aloof younger students, a sort of Israeli Bloomsbury Intellectuals.\nTo my delight Bennie Ornan, who was by then close to retirement, started to attend our meetings. At his suggestion, we turned to the discussion of Hebrew translations of modern novels and plays. On of them was George Orwell’s 1984. As was to be expected, some of our participants came with the English original. In our discussion, we concentrated on the differences between the author’s own tome and the Hebrew version. We concluded that, in many instances, the translator departed from the original so as to adjust the text for the needs of the Israeli reader. We also dealt with Orwell’s predictions. We concluded that in 1968 – when our analytical debate took place – none of Orwell’s prophecies had materialized. Today, in 2019, when I am writing as an old retiree, I am satisfied that most of Orwell’s predictions were off the mark. I do, however, admire the clarity and straightforwardness of his style.\nWe covered many books in our meetings. One of them was Kafka’s The Castle, which was translated to Hebrew from the German original saved by Max Brod (the late Kafka’s literary executor). On this occasion Leo Shalev, who learned about our circle from Galya, attended our debate. Leo, who had a perfect command of German, brought with him the original version. Another work of Kafka we discussed was The Metamorphosis (Die Verwandlung), which tells the story of the breadwinner of a working class family who is transformed into a beetle and the effect thereof on himself and his folks.\nThe highlight of our meetings was an analysis of Emile Zola’s Germinal, which had been translated into Hebrew. We also got a copy of the original. However, as there was no French speaker in our circle, we invited a teacher from the Berlitz School. With her help we managed to absorb the sociological message conveyed by the author. I regret the fact that this seminal book, dealing with a miners’ strike in France in about 1860 and with an anarchist’s philosophy, had not been made compulsory reading.\nToday, when I compose my autobiography, I have come to the conclusion that our meetings, which led in due course to the establishment of a Book Club, constituted a milestone in the development of Israel’s culture and outlook. I am proud of it. The Club remains active to the present day. Further, the initiative I took in the Club’s development paved the way to the next formative phase of my odyssey.\n9. The Israeli Educational Television Israel had no television during my youth. Our entertainment was confined to radio programmes and, of course, to the cinema and the theatre. When neighbouring countries launched television channels, some Israelis purchased sets which enabled them to watch. As the broadcasts were mainly in Arabic, the Israeli authorities became concerned about the impact that the propaganda may have on our Muslim citizens.\nEven so, the government was opposed to the introduction of a local channel. Ben Gurion and Sharett thought our population could do without it. The question was re-examined when Levi Eshkol became Prime Minster in 1963. On the advice of a United Nations Committee, the Israeli government concluded that it was desirable to launch an educational channel. Feelers were sent out to various foundations, one of which provided the required grant.\nThe Israeli Educational Television (“ITV”) was established in 1965, well before the Six-Day War. Its first broadcast took place in March 1966. The programmes were pedagogical, covering topics in Mathematics, Biology and English. In 1968, well after the conclusion of the War, the ITV began to share a Channel with the new General Public Television, which broadcasted programmes of a broader nature.\nAt the initial stages, I was not involved. My work at Tichon and at the Book Club kept me well occupied. Bennie Ornan, though, was one of the programmers of the ITV. Pointing out my interest in the theatre and my contributions through teaching and the Club, he recommended that I be asked to join this new venture. Initially, I was not keen to change employment. My career and attainments at TA.1 filled me with pride and satisfaction. Galya took a different view. She feared that my commitments in Tichon would quench my desire to leave a mark on the theatre world. She thought that the opportunity to regenerate my interest should not be missed. Her advice and Bennie’s persuasions convinced me to go ahead. Further, Sheen made things easy for me by suggesting that I take two years of leave without pay. If I decided to return to Tichon, the way back would be straightforward.\nMy new work was enjoyable. In a sense, I was well-placed to write and direct the programmes. My teaching courses on Israeli Literature and on Biblical Studies were an important asset. It pleased me to find out that quite a few members of our Book Club started to watch my television programmes. I was also asked to travel to the United States and to some other countries so as to promote our enterprise. This was a novel and interesting experience. One memorable trip was to London. After getting in touch with the Jewish community and with potential donors, I managed to spend a few days in the West End. One of the plays I saw was Oscar Wilde’s An Ideal Husband. The acting was superb and the staging outstanding. I admired the playwright’s sense of humour and his ability to play on words. It dawned on me that I still had a great deal to learn. I also spent an evening in Covent Garden but cannot remember which opera was performed.\nTwo unexpected developments pushed me further in the direction of a revival of my dream to play a role on the stage. The first was that Tevyeh the Milkman was popularised as a musical entitled Fiddler on the Roof. In turn, this led to a revival of the original play. It was now performed in leading and secondary theatres. Before long, I became one of the regular Tevyeh actors. The second event – which turned out to have a major impact on my life – was a telephone call from Nina Lasker. Signon had decided to stage Fiddler on the Roof. Leo Shalev was going to play Tevyeh but, at the very last minute, pulled out, claiming that he was unable to sing. He thought it best to withdraw before the critics had a chance to massacre him.\nI wanted to comply but, like Leo, had doubts about the adequacy of my voice for singing some of Tevyeh’s solos. Nina, though, pointed out that the audiences would clap as long as they were able to follow my soliloquies. The spectators did not expect an actor to be a fine tenor or baritone. Musically inclined patrons would go to the recently established Israeli opera.\nHad it not been for Galya’s prompting, I might have declined the offer. Today, when I am telling my life story, I am glad I decided to give the role a try. The applause I earned pleased me. I sensed that the risk had paid off.\nWe had an eight-week run. One of our last performances was attended by Rabbi Moshe Margalioth, who had come to Israel to celebrate the Passover week in Jerusalem. By sheer chance, he visited Tel Aviv while the show was on. After the performance, he paid me a visit. He wanted to know whether I might be prepared to come to Brooklyn and play Tevyeh in their ‘modest’ theatre. I was intrigued but was not certain whether I ought to take the offer seriously.\nTo my delight, Margalioth followed the matter up after he returned to the United States. The Bursar of the Jewish Wellbeing Foundation (often referred to as the Moshe Margalioth Foundation) offered me a handsome honorarium and undertook to defray my travelling and upkeep expenses. Galya and Bennie encouraged me to accept. After some deliberations I applied for two months of leave without pay and flew to New York.\nI spent most of my time in Margalioth’s Yeshiva in Brooklyn. I was impressed with the fervour of the disciples, the Bahurei Ha’Yeshiva. They appeared engrossed in their studies, which took five years. I noted that their curriculum covered mainly Talmud and medieval Judaic writings. Bible Critique was, of course, a prohibited field. I surmised that success in these studies would lead to an eventual appointment as a Rabbi. To start with, though, a graduate was required to spend a few years as a delegate (Shaliah) in an established community. I also noticed that most disciples were conversant in Yiddish but had an inadequate command of Hebrew and of the history of the Orient.\nMargalioth was keen that I stage Fiddler on the Roof. Initially, I tried to persuade him to stage the original, non musical version, of Tevyeh the Milkman. The Rabbi objected. He thought that, whenever possible, we should keep up with social changes. Whilst traditional Judaic laws could not be altered, we had to keep up with secular developments.\nWe had to find an actress prepared to play the role of Tevyeh’s wife, Miriam: an obedient yet firm and commanding wife. In many situations, she had the last word. Somehow, her mantle did not suit the temperament and outlook of modern young women.\nWe had to search hard but, eventually, found a volunteer. Yentl Jacobs, the daughter of a traditional and wealthy Jewish merchant, thought she could come to terms with the role, especially as she could identify with Miriam’s values. Yentl explained that her dream was to find a reliable and self-made man, who would make his own decisions but listen to his wife’s counsel.\nYentl excelled in her role. I believe that the enthusiastic applause we enjoyed was triggered by her performance. I am further satisfied that all the supporting roles were played well. In particular, I was impressed by a young fellow, who played Perchic – the young Jewish revolutionary who is engaged by Tevyeh as a teacher. When Perchic is exiled to Siberia, one of Tevyeh’s daughters decides to join him because she is in love with him. The heart breaking parting scene, when Tevyeh accompanies her to the railway station, was convincing.\nFor me, the most difficult scene was Tevyeh’s dream, which he makes up in order to convince his wife that their oldest daughter ought to be married to Motel the poor tailor rather than to the aging wealthy butcher. The difficulty arose because Tevyeh fakes his dream whilst Miriam and he are sleeping in the matrimonial bed. As the musical was staged in an orthodox community, I was apprehensive of the audience’s reaction to seeing an actor and actress in a bedroom scene.\nMy forebodings, though, were unrealistic. The audience roared with laughter as I narrated Tevyeh’s mirage. Furthermore, Yentl played Miriam’s role forcefully. Having noted my patent relief, she brought the matter up for discussion.\n“Chayim,” she asked, “why were you so nervous about this scene?”\n“I feared our people would be perturbed by the display.”\n“But they knew that this was a narrative. We must move with the times, Chayim. Surely, you don’t expect us to live up to the ideals of a period in our remote past. You know full well that I do not wear a Scheitel (wig) or wait for the matchmaker to find me a husband.”\n“I understand. But where do you draw the line? You do observe Kashrut (Jewish dietary laws) and dress conservatively. Some ideals and norms have to be retained.”\n“Of course,” she agreed, “the essence has remained intact; but the periphery metamorphoses. Surely, many of our people wear modern clothes rather than outdated Turkic attire. Their core, though, is not adulterated.”\nI looked at her with growing respect. Here was a young woman who would observe the spirit of our commandments though, in her own way, she was world-wise and open-minded. At the same time, I sensed that she would take her duties and commitments seriously and would live up to her admirers’ expectations. I was not surprised when Rabbi Margalioth told me that Yentl served, pro bono, as nurse in the cancer ward of a well-known Jewish hospital. I felt confident that she did all she could for her patients.\nWhen we completed our performances, Rabbi Margalioth asked whether I would like to come over again. He felt confident that my talent would be appreciated in New York.\n“Why don’t you ask your wife to come over with you? I am certain we could find her good roles to play.”\n“She has set her heart on a career on the Israeli stage. She would not give up her aspirations,” I told him somewhat lamely.\nFor a while Rabbi Margalioth was lost in thought. At long last, he quoted Proverbs 12:4: “A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband; but she that acts shamefully is as rottenness in his bones.”\n“Surely, Rabbi, the second verse is inapplicable in our case. Is it shameful for a wife to further her own career?”\n“If she does so to her husband’s disadvantage, her attitude becomes questionable. Genesis 2:20 suggests that God created the woman to be ‘a help to match him [Adam]’. From what you tell me, your wife sees things differently. You do all you can to further her career; but what is she doing for you?”\nA few days later I flew back to Tel Aviv. My superiors at the ITV encouraged me to have another spell in New York. They would be pleased if I penetrated into the American theatre hub. All in all, they regarded me their man and felt confident that, whenever I could, I would further their cause. Galya, however, was less enthusiastic. I had helped her a great deal with her own career. She had arrived. Still, she feared that if she left the scene, even temporarily, she might be passed over. I was of two minds. On the one hand, I was not keen to let a good opportunity slip by. On the other hand, I was keen to assist Galya to the best of my ability. Ronnie Eyal – whom I consulted – was equally uncertain.\nThe refurbished offer made to me a short while later was irresistible. Rabbi Margalioth invited me to come over for just two months and suggested that, on this occasion, it would be nice if I staged King Solomon and Shalmai the Cobbler. There was a substantial Israeli community in New York and many of its members would be keen to see an Israeli play. Yentl Jacobs, who had a good command of Hebrew, had already volunteered to take on one of the leading roles. He suggested that I play the Solomon/Shalmai role. It would have been preferable to find an actor not as heavy set as I: the role was more suitable for a lightly built and athletic looking man. As no such person was available, I started to rehearse. Before long I concluded that I could manage. Ronnie Eyal volunteered to supervise my preparations and assisted me with the memory work involved.\nI pleaded with Galya. It seemed to me that like other actors and actresses she had the right to take a period of leave and accompany me. To my regret, she refused to budge. I was facing Hobson’s choice. I could either proceed to Brooklyn on my own or turn down Rabbi Margalioth’s attractive offer. I surmised that, if I did so, the offer would not be repeated. In the end, self-interest prevailed.\nGalya looked thoughtful when we parted in the airport. Looking her over, I realised that she was no longer the young girl I had taken out when I heard her scream for help. She was now in her thirties and the stress of playing one role after the other had left its mark. She was looking haggard but, notwithstanding this change, I sensed that she had remained committed to her place on the stage.\n“Chayim,” she said after a pause, “are we falling apart?”\n“I don’t think so, Darling. I am simply paving my own route.”\n“You used to rehearse me and enhance my memory. How shall I manage without your prompting?”\n“Where there is a will, there is a way. And by now I have taught you all the memorising tricks I know.”\n“Once again, I am on my own. I thought you would continue to coach me. Still, you must pursue your own interests. I know this.”\n“If you really feel the pinch, try to get help from Ronnie Eyal. He is a good and kind sort of a chap.”\nRabbi Margalioth looked at me thoughtfully when I arrived in New York on my own.\n“So your wife decided to pursue her own career?!”\n“She did, rather. But Rabbi, she acted true to character. Originally, she surmised that I would continue to coach and assist her year after year. I can – I do – understand her. In her own way, she feels let down.”\nRabbi Margalioth nodded sagely. He appreciated that I was disappointed but sensed that he ought to keep his peace. Negative comments were uncalled for. In his eyes, the eyes of a traditional and observant Jew, the bond of marriage was sacrosanct. Husband and wife became one flesh. If their relationship became problematic, an outsider’s task was to smooth the rough edges over.\nThe staging of King Solomon and Shalmai the Cobbler went smoothly. Most members of the audience were, of course, aware that the play was inspired by Mark Twain’s The Prince and the Pauper. Nevertheless, they clapped enthusiastically at each of the songs and generally showed their appreciation. They came to be entertained and left enriched and satisfied. Once again, I realised that I was contributing to the standing of Israeli art. My sole regret was that Galya was not there to see.\nA few weeks later, I attended the Seder (the Passover feast) in Rabbi Margalioth’s welcoming home. To my surprise he raised a point concerning my being on my own.\n“Chayim, I was hoping that Galya would be with us and that your son would ask the Kushiot (the ritual questions, dealing with the characteristics of the Seder). My only son is a grown-up man and, I am afraid, married out and is secular.”\n“I don’t have children, Rabbi,” I replied lamely.\n“How come?”\n“Galya does not want to have any. She says she cannot spare the time needed to bear them and to look after them. She claims she would be a poor Mother.”\n“But God commanded Adam and Eve (Gen. 1:28) and, after the Flood, Noah and his sons to ‘be fruitful and multiply’(Gen. 9:1). A childless marriage is barren. Don’t you yourself want offspring?”\n“I do. But many of my students treat me as a father figure. This is some compensation. And I feel proud of them. Their success is mine!”\n“I understand,” muttered my host uneasily. Obviously, he was not convinced.\n“And look here Rabbi: am I the youngest male at our Seder? If so, why not let me ask the Kushiot. Am I much older than your son?”\n“About the same age. And he declined my invitation last year. I have not repeated it. Please go ahead.”\nWe finished the Seder well after midnight. All of us were tired but felt elated, especially as each of us drank the compulsory four glasses of wine. I knew full well that the authenticity of the Exodus from Egypt had been disputed by modern scholars. But Passover was a Jewish religious festival. It was part and parcel of our tradition. To me, Exodus was real and historically indisputable.\nA few weeks after Passover I got ready for my return trip to Israel. To my delight Rabbi Margalioth told me that he was going to invite me over again.\nGalya met me in Lydda airport. On the way to a nearby restaurant, I told her that Margalioth invited me to come over in about a year. Galya looked perturbed. She said little during our pleasant oriental lunch but broke her silence on the way home.\n“Chayim, we are slowly but surely falling apart. From now on you will spend a few months every year in New York. I am not going to accompany you. I want to rise high in Tel Aviv. Is it possible that our marriage has run its course?”\n“What do you mean?” I asked with trepidation.\n“Wouldn’t it better for us to call it a day?”\n“You mean a ‘divorce’, don’t you?”\n“I do, rather.”\n“Very well,” I told her when we arrived.\nA few days later we went to the Rabbinate. There being no issues of property or of the custody of children, the proceedings were straightforward: I handed Galya a deed of divorce (a Get) and the Rabbi-in-Charge made an entry in his book. As we left the building we were no longer husband and wife.\nGalya looked at me attentively. She realised that my stern silence hid the feeling of disappointment and emptiness that filled me. I concluded that I had wasted some of the best years of my life. When I first met her, I had been a pariah in Signon. I was on my own though not carefree. When I started to go out with Galya, I did have a warm affection for her even if passionate love had never engulfed me. I now reverted to my lonely existence.\n“A penny for your thoughts,” said Galya.\n“I feel I have missed out,” I conceded. “Also you, Galya, are not a self-sufficient person. You need a caregiver. It is your nature!”\n“I know,” she agreed. “But look, Chayim, I have already found somebody and I am certain you will not remain on a limb for too long. I suspect your Rabbi has plans for you.”\nWe were about to part as we reached the next street corner. To my surprise, Galya addressed me again: “Look here, Chayim: ours is not a bitter or acrimonious divorce. Both of us took it in our stride and remained civil about it. Surely, we are still friends. Come and have lunch; you’ll meet an old comrade.”\nThe cozy oriental restaurant was as welcoming as ever. A dish of Humus followed up with tangent Kebabs cheered me up. Then, as we were ready to order dessert, Ronnie Eyal arrived.\n“You are late, Ronnie,” said Galya. “That’s not like you. I asked Chayim to join us. We’ll wait with our dessert until you have finished your main course.”\n“I am not very hungry,” he told us. “I’ll just have a dessert.”\nAs the sweets arrived, my mind kept racing. It dawned on me that Galya had found her next husband. Far from feeling resentment or bitterness, I was overcome by relief. Galya would have a shoulder to lean on, and Ronnie – a born caregiver – would be happy to lend it. My former responsibilities would be borne by him.\n“The two of you have good rapport,” I observed.\n“We do,” affirmed Galya.\n“Do you plan to get married pretty soon?” I wanted to know.\n“There is an obstacle,” Galya told me.\n“I thought that was sorted out this morning. You may want to wait for a short while so as to let things settle down. But this, surely, is no problem.”\n“There is a different hurdle,” Ronnie chimed in. “You see, Chayim, my original name was Ronald Hirsh; and I was married to a German woman: Hilda. She was Aryan. And I was in love with her.”\n“Did you divorce her when Hitler came to power?” I asked with concern. I was overcome by fear: what might emerge now that Pandora’s Box has been opened?\n“The Nazis had the marriage declared null and void. I managed to escape and became Ronnie (Yaron) Eyal.”\n“But where is the problem? You are no longer married to Hilda?”\n“Would the annulment be recognized in Israel?”\n“Has she ever contacted you after the end of WWII?”\n“She hasn’t. Actually, I would have rebuffed any feelers! I felt – still feel – betrayed. If I was good enough to be chosen as mate, why didn’t she stand by me in an hour of need?”\nI looked at my friend with concern. It was easy for me to understand his feelings and the ensuing bitterness. I also wondered why he had never mentioned the subject previously. It then dawned on me that like many Holocaust victims he felt the need to maintain his silence. He had buried the past except that, at the present moment, it ruled him from the grave.\nAs I looked up, I took in the expectant expression that descended on the faces of Galya and Ronnie. I sensed that each of them was keen to have my view.\n“As far as I can see, you are an unattached man, Ronnie. Hilda has not contacted you; presumably she…”\n“… passed away,” interjected Ronnie. “Our last abode was in Dresden and, as far as I know, Hilda had never moved. Chances are she perished in the bombings. I believe she joined the Red Cross, which suffered heavy casualties.”\n“More than seven years passed since the end of WWII. So she is presumed dead. So where is the obstacle?”\n“We had a son. He lives in England. I fear his reaction.”\n“Are you in touch with him?”\n“I am not. He wrote to me a few years ago, inviting me to his own wedding. I did not reply.”\n“How did he survive the onslaught? According to Nazi doctrine he would be considered a Jew!”\n“Hilda managed to smuggle him out. He came to England on a refugees’ train. He grew up as an Englishman.”\n“How on earth could you reject him, Ronnie?” I expostulated. “In Germany he was unwanted because of his Jewish blood and you rejected him because his Mother deserted you? Poor unlucky chap!”\n“That is what Galya keeps telling me. Did the two of you, per chance, have a discreet discussion before I arrived?”\n“Of course we haven’t,” protested Galya. “We just happen to be of the same view!”\n“Oh well,” yielded Ronnie. “What course would you recommend?”\n“You better set a date for your wedding, Ronnie,” I told him. “And you may consider inviting your son. Whether you like it or not, he is your flesh and blood!”\n“I’ll think it over,” responded Ronnie after a while.\nIn due course, I rented a small flat next to my working place. Occasionally I had lunch with Ronnie and Galya. I was pleased when he told me that his son, Joseph, had accepted his invitation to attend the wedding.\nActually, when I am recalling these events nowadays, when I am an old man writing his autobiography, I believe that sorting out Ronnie Eyal’s problem was my first experience as a faith healer. By inducing him to look deep into his own soul, I freed him from the constraints imposed by an unpalatable past.\nBefore I flew to the United States, my Israeli boss called me up for a frank discussion. He told me that he was prepared to grant me the required leave for another two years. Thereafter he was going to assign me a new task, which would require my being regularly in Tel Aviv.\n“Look here, Chayim,” he told me, “presently you have a post which requires you to be off-station on a regular basis. However, in the long run we need you at base. If you decide, at any time, to move to the United States, you better settle there for good or use it as your main quarters.”\n“That is fair,” I confirmed. “Up to now my two engagements were complementary. Sooner or later, though, I may have to make my choice.”\n“I do hope you will stay with us. Your home is here – in Tel Aviv. And you are a real Israeli. But all in all, we live in a free world.”\nRabbi Margalioth welcomed me when I arrived in New York. Initially, I staged Fiddler on the Roof and a number of topical plays. I realised that major theatres, on Broadway, would not open their doors to let me in. But I was acquiring a solid reputation as an ambassador of Israeli art and culture in New York. It was a pleasant existence and I was perturbed by the thought of giving it up when my assignment in Israel was altered.\nWhen I finished my first performance in Brooklyn, Rabbi Margalioth had a long chat with me. He pointed out that I thrived in my position in New York and, he suspected, had come to like it as much as my role in Tel Aviv. He felt that the community needed me and added that he, too, had an interest in the matter. He was nearing retirement and keenly felt the need of a successor. For years he handled the affairs of the Yeshiva and, in addition, had to look after the affairs of the Foundation. He would have liked his son to take over but, as he had told me before, his lad was secular and had no inclination to look after the Foundation’s affairs.\n“Why don’t you join us here, Chayim. I have been watching you and I think you have the attributes.”\n“I have not graduated from a Yeshiva,” I told him. “You need a locum who can officiate as a Rabbi.”\n“If you want to settle here, you will have to join our Yeshiva. We’ll see to it that you earn a living during this period.”\n“I believe it is a five-year course. Enrolling at this stage of my life for such a long period of ‘further studies’, is a bit out of place.”\n“But we would not expect you to enroll for such a long period of time. We would take your earlier studies and contributions into account and give you cross credits. I cannot commit myself now but, judging from previous cases, it is not going to be anything like five years.”\nThe proposition was attractive. In Israel I had reached my career level. Youth was behind me. A new start in Israel as I approached middle-age was out of the question. Rabbi Margalioth’s proposition made room for this. Hoping that I remained up to the challenge, I decided to enroll in his Yeshiva, asking that my earlier studies and career be taken into account. Initially, the Board wanted me to enroll for three years. After some haggling, we settled on two years. In point of fact, Rabbi Margalioth took the view that such a period of further studies would enable me to acquire a profound knowledge of Judaic medieval literature. I had touched upon the subject sporadically when I read for my B.A. in the Hebrew University but had only a generic knowledge of it. A perusal of the Yeshiva’s curriculum whetted my appetite to know more.\nRabbi Margalioth took the initiative to enable me to further my interest in staging plays. Our choice fell on the plot of the second volume of the last novel of Shalom Aleichem: the very author whose earlier novel formed the basis of the play Tevyeh the Milkman and the ensuing musical Fiddler on the Roof.\nMotl, Peysie the Cantor’s Son was written in 1916. It dealt with the resettlement of Motl’s Russian Jewish family in the United States and the problems faced by them in their new environment. Of particular interest was their need to come to terms with labour riots that broke out in New York as workers took to the streets to protest their working conditions. In the last chapter of the novel, the author described how the family started to prosper in the new abode.\nInitially, when Margalioth referred to the work, I raised three problems. First, the work was a novel. It could easily be adapted into a play but we needed the cooperation of a playwright. I was relieved when Margalioth assured me that one of his constituents had already made progress with the work.\nThe second problem arose because the novel had been composed in Yiddish. I was pleased when Margalioth told me that the work had been translated into English in 1953. He thought that, as many of our viewers were not conversant in Yiddish, we had to stage the play in English.\nThe main and last problem related to the topicality of the tome. It dealt with the resettlement in the United States of Jews driven out of Czarist Russia by the anti-Semitic policy of the government and by the incessant pogroms. Would our young generation be interested?\n“But is the position so different today? Holocaust victims, who migrated to the United States during and after WWII, often faced comparable problems, including the need to become conversant in an alien language and to develop a new outlook. I do believe that many of Motl’s experiences and antics would strike a chord.”\n“Do we have suitable players?” I wanted to know.\n“Yentl Jacobs is keen to play Motl’s Mother, who is of one of the main characters in the work.”\n“But how about Motl? He is a youngster!”\n“You can take your pick from amongst our students. I suggest you take up the role of Motl’s older brother. He, too, is central to the story.”\nMargalioth’s words convinced me. I had to edit the text and actually directed the drama. It was a success. The performance went on for a number of weeks and was well attended. It pleased me to see that the audience included many university students, who were keen to watch a play dealing with the life of Jewish migrants.\nAfter our last show I asked Rabbi Margalioth why, in his opinion, Joseph Stein and his team opted for Tevyeh the Milkman rather than for Motl, Paysee the Cantor’s Son when they decided to produce a musical. He answered that to the public at large Tevyeh was more acceptable than Motl. In the former, Shalom Aleichem described the plight of the Jews in Czarist Russia. The audience sympathised. In the latter, the author showed how Jewish migrants stuck to their own values when moving from one host country to another. Stein might have thought that Motl would feed anti-Semitism whilst Tevye was bound to invoke compassion.\n“It is, of course, also possible that Stein’s team found Tevyeh easier to transform into a musical than Motl,” he added. On reflection, I believe this to be the real ground.\nAs I was getting ready for the return trip to Tel Aviv, Rabbi Margalioth had a further frank chat with me.\n“So you have decided to settle in Brooklyn, Chayim?”\n“I have. I like the prospect of a change of career.”\n“Will you resign your post in the ITV?”\n“I shall do so. Initially, I toyed with the idea of applying for two years of leave without pay. But I have decided against such a course. I want to take a final step and start afresh.”\n“Good decision, I believe. But don’t you want to discuss the matter with your wife? What will you do if she refuses to relocate?”\n“We were divorced last year, Rabbi. So I am again on my own: a middle-aged man with no strings attached.”\n“Aren’t you going to remarry?”\n“I might: if a really nice girl thinks I’m ‘Mr. Right’!”\nMy superiors in the ITV had actually anticipated my resignation. My only problem was the need to sever my relations with the Book Club. To my delight, Uri agreed to take over. He added that I would be welcome to attend whenever I came to Tel Aviv. He also encouraged me to make recommendations respecting the pick of American novels. He thought that Williams Faulkner’s books deserved attention. Light in August, he opined, provided a window into the milieu of the Southern States. I agreed that the work deserved attention.\nBefore I proceeded to New York, I caught up with Galya and Ronnie. They struck me as happy and contented. It pleased me that, ever since their wedding, Ronnie remained in touch with his son, Joseph, who had actually converted to Judaism and was married to a British Jewess.\nFor a number of sessions I continued to travel to Israel mainly for my militia service. Then, in 1973, we experienced the Yom Kippur War. Much research has gone into the analysis of this episode and so I shall address mainly what I had experienced during those fateful days.\nIt is common ground that Israel’s neighbours had intentionally started the war on our holiest day. Israel’s intelligence had information about the build up of Arab armies but the politicians decided against a preemptive strike. During the first few days of the war, Egypt broke Israel’s defence line on the Western Bank of the Canal and advanced into the Sinai Peninsula. Syria, in turn, recaptured parts of the Golan Heights. In the ensuing bitter battles, Israel eventually had the upper hand. Ariel Sharon managed to encircle the 3rd Egyptian army and Syria was defeated in the North. I am satisfied that Israel’s victory was due mainly to the fine training of our soldiers and the capability of our commanders. I am further convinced that, had it not been for American arms supplies and assistance, the outcome might have been different.\nI did not take part in the battles. During the first day of the War, Bennie Ornan summoned me to help sustain our soldiers’ morale. After the magnificent victory in the Six-Day War, both Israel and the Arab world considered our armed forces invincible. Israel boasted confidence whilst to the Arabs the 1967 defeat was humiliating and shameful.\nThe first two days of the 1973 War restored Arab morale. To us, these days came as a shock. Quite a number of well-known Israeli actors joined our Corps’ efforts to restore the self-esteem of our soldiers and population. We traveled from brigade to brigade and performed programmes asserting that nothing of significance had been lost. The news media joined force. I do believe that our efforts bore fruit and helped to restore our population’s confidence and pride. To the very present day, I maintain that, if we had failed to re-establish Israeli self-esteem, it would have been difficult (perhaps even impossible) to regain the upper hand.\nA few days after the end of the conflict, I was due in New York. I felt that the flight to New York was a trip back to base. My view was shared by Rabbi Margalioth. When I attended his next Shabbat Eve Reception, on Friday evening, I felt at home.\nBefore long Rabbi Margalioth suggested that I meet Harris Jacobs, Yentl’s father. He told me that Harris, a successful businessman, was keen to make sure that Yentl, his only daughter, would find a good partner for life.\n“But Rabbi, surely Yentl can find a better catch. I am at least fifteen years older than her and, in terms of worldly accomplishment, my attainments are limited. Further, I do have aspirations but the route may be long and winding.”\n“Perhaps Yentl aspires to stand by you and be of support as you proceed?”\n“Do you think she might really be interested?”\n“I am sure Harris would have discussed things with her before he asked us to meet him.”\nThe meeting with Harris Jacobs went smoothly. He was aware that in our modern Jewish communal life, there was no room for the old type of matchmaker, discussed in Tevyeh the Milkman. Harris had already talked to Yentl and the main object of our discussion concerned details. I was pleasantly surprised when Harris told me that instead of the customary dowry, he proposed to buy Yentl a house. He wanted to know whether I would prefer accommodation in Brooklyn or in Manhattan. We settled on a roomy flat in the former and then proceeded to fix a suitable date and abode for the ceremony.\nIt was a lavish wedding. Food was abundant and Israeli wines were flowing. Traditional Jewish music was performed by a local band. Rabbi Margalioth gave us his blessing and, in a brief address, expressed his hope that the newlyweds would be happy and be blessed with children.\nWhen I am thinking about these events at present – when I write my autobiography – one fact stares in my face. In the ultimate every one of us is guided either by a Hidden Hand or by sheer chance. I started life as an odd jobs boy in Tel Aviv; got admitted to a brilliant secondary school; made an unsuccessful attempt to break into the Israeli theatre world; and later settled on a teaching career followed by a posting in the ITV. Who could foresee that, thereafter, I would end up as a student in a Yeshiva in Brooklyn? Who could predict that I would marry twice? The very same fortuitous factors determined the lives of some of my friends. One ended as a law teacher in an Oriental country, another became an Ordinary Professor in an American University and a third became a highly regarded stockbroker.\nDoubters maintain that chance alone is the decisive factor. A traditional thinker – like me – is inclined to see the Hidden Hand of a Superior Being. I am unable to prove my point. All the same, I do believe in it. After all, ours is a free world. Every one of us has the right to assess imponderables in his (or her) own way. On this right of free choice I am actually in tandem with an inherent skeptic like my friend Bushi.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novels/bright-lion/part-3/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"7-employment-and-my-first-marriage\"\u003e7.

Financially, I could have stuck to my existing enterprises; they were sound. My ambition though was for a future on the stage. Bennie Ornan kept encouraging me to apply for a position in the army’s Entertainment Corps. He was convinced that my medical misadventure did not present an obstacle. I was, however, perturbed by the realisation that the Corps’ main object was indoctrination. I wanted to devote myself to art. For that reason I did not send feelers to TA.1. I knew that a teacher’s career was well paid and satisfactory. I knew also that, if I joined TA.1, Sheen would encourage me to perform shows. My ambition, though, remained the theatre.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Part 3: Settling Down in Tel Aviv"},{"content":"A few weeks later, I had proof of the validity of their assessment. Notwithstanding my heavy teaching load and other commitments in Singapore, I had been working steadily on my doctoral thesis. Our library’s holding were adequate for my research of the English and Commonwealth law in point but, as was to be expected, had few materials from other jurisdictions. To get them, I had to spend some time in Oxford.\nAs soon as my teaching courses ended when the academic session was over – about one year after my arrival in Singapore – I obtained two months study leave. Having spent two weeks in Vienna with my father, I proceeded to London. After a series of visits to banks and to libraries in the City, I went up to Oxford. The two main law libraries – the law reading rooms in the Bodleian and the Codrington – became, once again, my Mecca. The only drawback was the working environment. The French and German law collections had to be read in the dark and poorly heated reading room of the Codrington. Any attempt to close one of the windows with the hope of curbing the drafts was frowned upon by the icy librarian. The Bodleian, in contrast, had warm and well-lit rooms but, alas, American cases were stored in freezing underground stacks, where you had to read to the light of a table lamp placed on one of the ramshackle desks in the vast hall.\nOne day, after a chilling spell of three hours in these stacks, I limped over to the old coffee house in Broad Street, ordering a steaming soup and a cup of hot tea. I was beginning to feel better when a voice said:\n“I heard you were back in Oxford, Peter.”\n“Lillo!” I exclaimed, shocked. It had taken me a few moments to recognise her. The shabbily dressed and poorly groomed woman facing me bore little resemblance to the elegant girl I used to see in Ranjan’s company.\n“Do I look so different?” she asked, sitting down opposite me.\n“Have you been unwell?” I could not help asking.\n“You could say that,” she retorted.\n“What went wrong?”\n“Don’t you know? I thought you joined Ranjan’s University.”\n“I have indeed,” I confirmed.\n“Didn’t you ask about me?”\n“I did,” I told her with foreboding. “He said you split. The way he put it, I thought you left him. So, I didn’t ask any more questions.”\n“He always knew how to handle people, Peter,” she replied with a strained smile. “No, Peter, I didn’t leave him. He jilted me!”\nI looked at her in sheer disbelief. Why should Ranjan have taken such a step? He knew only too well that given time, Lillo would be an asset in his political career. Mrs. de Silva – neé Stiglitz – illustrated the point. Further, there could be no doubt about Lillo’s loyalty and love for him.\n“I don’t understand,” I said lamely. “What did he tell you?”\n“He didn’t tell me a thing; he just left!”\n“Just like that?” I asked.\n“Just like that,” she confirmed.\nAfter the farewell party in Oxford, Ranjan moved from his rooms in college to her apartment. Everything seemed right. All plans had been set. A few weeks before the proposed date of departure, they went down to London and rented a serviced apartment. On the day before the flight, they had a sumptuous dinner and, Lillo admitted shamefacedly, too much wine. When she woke up next morning, Ranjan was not in the apartment. On the dining table was an envelope with a letter announcing his decision to leave.\n“But didn’t he give any reason?” I asked, dismayed.\n“He said he couldn’t live up to my expectations.”\n“Good God,” I exclaimed. Then, in an attempt to regain my composure, I asked: “So what did you do?”\nLillo stayed put in the serviced apartment for one week, hoping against hope that Ranjan would come back. She then went up to Oxford, hoping to get more information from myself but was told by my landlady I would be away for about two months. The landlady had told her she did not have a forwarding address.\nFeeling lonely and out of her depth, Lillo went back to her parents’ home in Zürich. She sent two letters to Ranjan but received no reply. Initially, she intended to remain in Switzerland but her longings for Ranjan and her inability to find her feet in her native town drove her back to Oxford. By sheer chance, her old room had just been vacated by its Nigerian tenant and her former landlady was pleased to let it to Lillo.\nOnce again, Lillo tried to contact me but soon discovered I had left. After a while she started to date a Sinhalese, called Joseph X who, like Ranjan before him, had come to read for the BCL. Joseph, though good looking, was nothing like Ranjan. Lillo did not fall in love with him.\n“Do you think Ranjan would come back to me?” she asked, gazing at me anxiously.\n“I have no idea,” I tried to dodge the issue and, then, prodded by my conscience, added: “Ranjan is not inclined to retrace his steps.”\n“But does he have some other woman out there?”\n“He’s not going steady with any girl,” I answered with relief.\n“But he’s not just on his own, is he?”\n“Well, no; he goes out with girls he meets in the University. But I don’t know of any attachment … you know what I mean.”\n“I did everything he wanted,” wailed Lillo. “Honestly, Peter, he won’t find a more supportive or loyal girl. I love him; and I can’t make myself forget him.”\nFor a while both of us remained silent. I had nothing to say. Lillo was fidgeting, uncertain whether to unburden herself any further. She resumed her story when both us felt that the silence was getting oppressive. She told me they had planned to renovate Ranjan’s family home in Colombo, had intended to purchase a second house and had made plans for raising a family.\n“But how were you going to get enough money? Ranjan’s father lost their wealth.”\n“I gave him all I had,” she told me. “My grandmother left me a lot of money in her will.”\n“How much did he take?” I asked, once again shocked.\n“About five thousand pounds.”\nI looked at her closely. In those days, five thousand pounds was a fortune. You could easily purchase a house in Summertown – one of Oxford’s best suburbs – for less than that. Had Ranjan asked her to give him the money or had she offered it to him in an attempt to bind him as closely as possible?\nMy recollection of a conversation I had with Ranjan supported Lillo’s assertion. He had asked me to recommend a Swiss bank with a sound record in international investments. I pointed out that any such bank would accept a customer only if he was in a position to invest a few thousand pounds.\n“That’s fine,” Ranjan had countered.\nLillo’s narrative threw light on the source of his funds. My assumption that he had made a killing on the Singapore Stock Exchange – natural as it had been – had been misguided.\n“But didn’t he offer to pay it back to you?” I asked Lillo.\n“Well, he didn’t; and I did not ask. You see, I wanted – still want – him. I have enough money, Peter; and it can’t make me happy.”\nAt this point our conversation was interrupted. Joseph X., Lillo’s current boyfriend, looked at me suspiciously when he made a beeline for our table. He was out of breath and flustered.\n“You must have met Peter,” Lillo regained her composure as she addressed him.\n“We met in a seminar,” I volunteered. “Please join us.”\n“Lillo, did you forget we have tickets for the concert?” blurted Joseph.\n“I did rather,” admitted Lillo as she rose in a hurry. “I’ll have to go now, Peter; but look me up when you have a free moment. Here is my address.”\nAs they departed in haste, I felt sympathy for Joseph. Like Ranjan, he was a tall, broad shouldered and good looking fellow. But he lacked Ranjan’s self-assurance and patrician airs. Lillo was not deceived by his veneer. She had captivated him; but the bond was one sided.\nI left the library that evening with the intention of looking Lillo up during my weekend. True, she had completed her tale or, at the very least, the gist of it. I knew I could not comfort her. Yet, I felt the need of lending a supporting shoulder. Somebody had to tell this attractive girl that her relationship with Ranjan was over. She had to turn her head from the past to the future.\nUnfortunately, I came down with a severe cold, which soon turned into bronchitis. When I was back on my feet – after some ten days – I had to catch up on my work. Lillo and her lot appeared remote.\nSome two weeks prior to my return flight to Singapore, as I was having a hot soup and a sandwich in the Broad Street coffee house, the cashier’s glance directed a plainly dressed man to my table.\n“I am Inspector Jack Oliver,” he told me. “I wonder if I could take a few minutes of your time?”\n“Of course,” I replied, startled.\n“Do you know this girl?” he asked as I looked at a photograph produced by him.\nLillo’s countenance looked stiff and, I thought, still. Yet her mouth was agape and her eyes closed.\n“She looks like a girl I know. Her name is Lillo … Sorry, I can’t recall her surname.”\n“Are you certain it’s her?”\n“Well, yes,” I confirmed and added: “Is something wrong with her?”\n“Her body was fished out of the Cherwell.”\n“How ghastly. How did it happen?”\n“That’s what we investigate. What can you tell me about her?”\nInspector Oliver went on to explain that Lillo’s body had not been identified. They found no documents or other identification on her. Judging by her clothes and age, he assumed she had been a student. When nobody in the women’s colleges recognised her, he showed the photograph to staff in the haunts frequented by the younger generation. The cashier in the Broad Street coffee house told him she had seen her conversing with one of their patrons. He came over in the hope of spotting that acquaintance.\nInspector Oliver asked me to tell him what I knew about her. When I finished my account, he asked if I knew where she lived. Having noted the address, he observed that the landlady had put in a missing person report, but the police had failed to connect it with the body found in the river. He was going to call on the landlady but, before he did, wanted me to identify the body. On the way to the mortuary, he told me that a dead body was an unpleasant sight.\n“I thought the dead look serene and calm,” I muttered.\n“Not when they have drowned,” he cautioned and, after a short break, added: “This girl passed the point of no return before she jumped or was pushed. A block of concrete was tied to her neck. She struggled.”\n“How was she found?” I wanted to know.\n“Her body floated when the rope came loose.”\nWhen we left the mortuary Inspector Oliver offered me a cup of coffee. He could see I had been shaken by the sight of poor Lillo’s listless body. Sounding apologetic, he asked me to attend the inquest, in case my evidence was needed. He undertook to do his best to keep Ranjan’s name out of the proceedings.\nIn the event, my evidence was not required. Joseph X testified that Lillo had agreed to marry him. He could not understand what had happened. His family was ready to accept her with open arms; and he felt confident she had a bright future in front of her as his wife in Ceylon. Appearing ill at ease and bewildered, Joseph did not try to hide his grief and disappointment. Everyone in court felt sorry for him.\nFollowing a brief account by Lillo’s landlady – who described her late tenant as a respectable and considerate girl – the stand was taken by Lillo’s father, an ageing man, wearing a dark grey suit and a discreet old-fashioned tie. Maintaining his composure and intoning his words, Frank Beer described his daughter’s background and home life. He left no doubt as to the family’s affection for his late daughter. One detail mentioned by him threw light on Lillo’s disposition and motivation. She had apparently gone into a severe depression after having failed some examinations in high school.\n“We were afraid she could do something silly then,” he volunteered. “But my wife and her sister talked to her and made her calm down; and I told her it was not the end of the world. So, we persuaded her to try again; and she listened. Next time she passed with good grades.”\nAs expected, the coroner’s verdict was of death by the deceased’s own hand whilst in a state of temporary insanity. As we milled out of the courtroom, Frank Beer asked whether I was Ranjan’s colleague in Singapore. To my surprise, he invited me for afternoon tea at the Randolph.\n“Inspector Oliver,” he went straight to the point after placing our orders, “told me you knew my daughter and her fiancé before he went to Singapore.”\n“I did,” I confirmed; “and look – I am from Vienna; so we can speak German if you prefer.”\n“How well did you know them?” asked Frank Beer, declining to switch to German.\n“We went to concerts together and we had a few dinners in Oxford.”\n“Was he in love with her?”\n“I thought so; I was sure they were going to get married.”\n“But what did Ranjan tell you in Singapore? You were not surprised she was not there?”\n“He told me they had split; so I didn’t ask any further questions. Then – here in Oxford – Lillo told me he had sort of left her – I mean left without telling her.”\n“You didn’t expect anything like this – I mean when you went out with them here?”\n“I certainly didn’t; I still can’t understand it.”\nFor a while, we conversed about Lillo’s childhood and youth in Zürich. She had been highly strung and difficult to handle during her adolescence. Ranjan was not her first boyfriend. She had been going steady with a young banker in Zürich but – for no apparent reason – broke off the engagement.\n“My son and other daughter are more steady. They take after me,” confided Frank Beer. “They married young and so now we are grandparents.”\nHis wife had taken the blow hard. She blamed herself for what had happened. All along, she had been wary of her daughter marrying a non-European. But she was reluctant to voice her doubts. Now she was worn out by her grief and feelings of guilt. Frank Beer thought it best to come to Oxford on his own.\n“Perhaps Lillo tried too hard,” he mused.\n“She might have,” I agreed, adding as an after-thought: “She told me she gave him some money.”\n“She did,” confirmed Frank Beer. “I’ve seen her bank statements.”\n“Should I tell him to pay it back?” I asked.\n“Please don’t! We don’t need the money; and she gave it to him. So let him keep it.”\nShortly after my return to Singapore I ran into Ranjan in the Law School. He looked well, and displayed his usual business-like airs. Pleased to see me, he was keen to hear the news about Oxford. It was obvious that the sad tale of Lillo’s end had not reached his ears.\nRanjan’s reaction to the news was subdued. When I finished my narration of the facts, he asked – in his direct manner – whether his name had been mentioned at the inquest.\n“I managed to keep your name out, Ranjan,” I assured him. “The detective in charge was most helpful. And Lillo’s father did not want to have his daughter’s personal life further exposed. And, Ranjan, did you know she was engaged to marry Joseph X?”\n“I didn’t; but I should have expected something like it,” he told me.\n“She was still in love with you, Ranjan. When I spoke to her she hoped you’d come back.”\n“That was not on, Peter,” he told me firmly.\n“Why did you ditch her, Ranjan?”\nHis eyes strayed away from mine. When the silence had become oppressive, he asked: “Didn’t you realise things were not that simple, Peter? You went out with us quite a few times. Don’t tell me you didn’t form your own conclusions!”\n“Perhaps I closed my eyes,” I admitted. “But one thing was clear: the girl was in love with you – to the hilt!”\n“I know,” he affirmed.\n“And she shone at your farewell party! She was looking forward to the future!”\n“Don’t rub it in,” he replied, dejected.\n“But why, Ranjan – why?”\n“There are things an outsider cannot see, Peter. I’d rather not say any more. We can’t bring her back – you know that!”\nIt was my turn to avert my eyes. All in all, it was pointless to dwell on poor Lillo’s fate. The curtain had fallen. Why should I fret whether Ranjan had reason to feel guilty or had merely asserted his right to freedom. It was not my business. In any event, Lillo had been a mere acquaintance. Ranjan, in contrast, had become a close friend. My loyalty was due to him, not to her memory. All the same, I had to have an answer to one question. Trying hard to keep my composure, I told Ranjan what Lillo had said about the money.\n“I suppose it’s true – I mean, not a fairy tale?”\n“It is,” he conceded. “Do you think her family wants it back?”\n“I had tea with her father. He saw her bank statements; but they don’t want it back.”\n“Well, I can put it to good use,” said Ranjan.\n“But do you need it?” I asked indiscreetly.\n“I do, rather” he told me.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/a-candid-obituary/chapter-4/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA few weeks later, I had proof of the validity of their assessment.

Exciting Auction “You look refreshed,” said Bill Riggs when I arrived next morning in his office.\n“Thanks. And how does the case stand?”\n“Our Judge is back in action. In the pre-trial conference, he urged the parties to settle!”\n“And have you?”\n“Whitehead and Blackburn won’t let us,” he said, referring to the two fighting cocks.\n“What’s the matter with those two?”\n“They had a quarrel – a shouting match – over the Wine Stewardship of their club. Since then they are not on speaking terms.”\n“How stupid! And this childish nonsense might cost the two companies a fortune in legal expenses?\u0026quot;\n“It might; but I won’t call it childish nonsense!” said Bill.\n“You wouldn’t?” I asked stunned.\n“You, Peter, overlook the place of a club in an Englishman’s life,” said Bill with mock severity.\n“I thought his castle is his home?” I protested\n“So it is, so it is. But the club is often a Briton’s social life centre. It’s a haven: his escape from his \u0026hellip; noisy home; it’s where he has his peaceful dinner or a drink with his friends.”\n“So a quarrel over a club matter can be a serious matter? I understand; but what are you going to do? Surely, you can’t allow this quarrel to determine the handling of our case?”\n“No, of course we can’t,” agreed Bill. He then went on to explain that the Chairmen of the two companies had approached a well known London banker, Sir Osbert Davies, to chair a mediation session to be held in two days times. Blackburn and Whitehead would listen to his peals of wisdom.\n“What is so special about Sir Osbert?” I wanted to know. “Is he by any chance a major shareholder in the two companies?”\n“His merchant bank is, rather” answered Bill. “But this, Peter, is not the main point. Sir Osbert is also the President of the very club which has the honour of counting Blackburn and Whitehead amongst its members!”\n“Good grief,” I expostulated. “So, in the end, it is the old boys net all over again!”\n“So it is, old boy, so it is! Quite a lucky break, wouldn’t you say?”\nFor the next forty minutes, I took my instructions for our forthcoming meeting. When business was finished, Bill asked unexpectedly: “Peter, have you met Sir Osbert Davies?”\n“Not that I know of. Why?”\n“When we briefed him, I mentioned that you were our expert witness. From his reaction, I gathered that your name rang a bell.”\n“He might have read ‘Modern Banking Law’.”\n“Could be” said Bill. “Generally, though, Sir Osbert is more interested in the Art than in the Law.”\nNext morning Yuan Ming and I made our way to Woodstock. When we arrived, the auction was in full swing. A short chat with the person sitting next to us disclosed that furniture had fetched a good price. As expected, the bidders had loosened their purse strings when told the proceeds would go to a charity.\nThe porcelain pieces were next to fall under the hammer. I had an easy time with the yellow-ground milk jug. The auctioneer’s erroneous announcement of a hair crack to the handle drove away the German dealers, who were bidding over the telephone.\nA change of auctioneers took place after the last piece of porcelain had been knocked down to a London dealer. The relief auctioneer, an elegantly dressed woman in her mid-thirties, took her place on the podium with confidence. To my delight, she proceeded at a considerably faster pace than the man she had replaced, prompting the audience to keep up with her by an occasional show of impatience.\nMost English paintings fetched reasonable rather than high prices. Few of them appealed to more than two or three bidders. ‘Galleon off Yarmouth’ was no exception. Roger Bates started the bidding, raising his numbered bidding pallet resolutely. He was not awed by the presence of so many professionals and upper middle class people and did not feel out of place. Indeed, the only concession made by him for the occasion was his well tailored new suit.\nInitially, Roger Bates’ bids were countered by a portly gentleman, of about my own age, whose discreet method of bidding reminded me of Arthur Smithies’ tactics. For a few minutes he kept pressing on but, with a quick shake of his head, gave up. Roger Bates smiled happily. Then, whilst the next painting was placed on the large easel, he rose to collect his acquisition. It was only then that I perceived the motherly and plainly dressed woman, who had been sitting quietly beside him. As they walked together in harmony to the collection corner, she bestowed on him a proud smile. It dawned on me that, more often than not, the Roger Bateses of this world enjoyed a pleasant existence. Their ready acceptance of the norms and values of their society shielded them from the disillusions, the frustrations and the upheavals bred by broad horizons, by sophistication and by great expectations.\nThe auction continued to progress smoothly and uneventfully. Tissot’s oil painting was knocked down to Yuan Ming for a reasonable price, the only opposition coming from the portly gentleman who had challenged Roger Bates. To my surprise, he glanced at us surreptitiously a few minutes later on. Then, whilst a few hunting scenes went speedily under the auctioneer’s effective hammer, I started to feel mounting excitement. Soon ‘Dawn’ was going to take her turn.\nBefore she called for bids, the auctioneer read out the revised catalogue entry. Yuan Ming was described as a “well known Chinese artist, born in Singapore, currently active in Los Angeles and renowned for her neat blending of Eastern techniques with Western motives”. The bidding was then opened at £2,000.00. I was about to raise my hand; but the portly gentleman came in first. Between us, the bidding was quickly raised to £3,200. At this point the portly gentleman gave up but a tall middle aged man stepped into the arena.\n“You mustn’t go on biddin, Uncle” murmured Yuan Ming anxiously when the auctioneer called for £4,000.00. “He’s Jack Levine, an art dealer from LA. He knows me well; and he mustn’t think I’m bidding on my own drawing.”\n“But it’s worth much more than this; let me press on, just for a bit; please.”\nJack Levine nodded when the auctioneer solicited a bid of £5,000.00. Raising the stops between the bids to ten per cent of the new offer, she called out, somewhat impatiently, for £5,500.00. As soon as I nodded, Yuan Ming whispered resolutely: “That’s as far as you go, Uncle.”\n“Six thousand I am bid; six thousand I am bid,” the auctioneer called when my opponent raised his hand without any change in his expression; “any bid of six thousand five hundred?” Seeing me shake my head in resignation, she went on: “Any further bid? None? Then for six thousand pounds I sell \u0026hellip;”\nA sharp snap of fingers drew the attention of all us to a small, pot bellied, informally dressed man, whose loud tie matched his flushed face with its beaky nose. Up to that moment, he had been standing unobtrusively near the entrance door without showing an interest in any of the preceding items.\n“Six thousand five hundred from a new bidder,” chanted the auctioneer; “do I hear £7,000?”\n“Uncle,” Yuan Ming was unable to contain her excitement; “Uncle, this new chap is David Schwarz, a famous art dealer from New York. I didn’t expect to find him here!”\n“Have you met him before?”\n“I have indeed; he bought ‘Dusk’ and ‘Stormy Night’.”\n“Oh well, so you have two Jewish experts fighting over your masterpiece” I said, watching keenly as the bidding continued at a breath taking speed. By the time they reached £10,000 the auctioneer, who had retained her cool exterior, started to raise each bid by £1,000. Unperturbed, the two pressed on. Then, abruptly, it was all over: Jack Levine shook his head lightly and, to my surprise, saluted his adversary. As ‘Dawn’ went under the hammer for £19,000, Schwarz, whose expression had not changed during the tussle, responded with an apologetic smile.\nTo me the rest of the auction was an anticlimax. My interest was roused again only when the a small landscape by a leading English artist became the subject of the last skirmish. The bidding, though, was swift. The auctioneer called for an amount close to the estimate so that only two interested patrons responded. After some forty seconds, the painting was knocked down for £25,000 to the portly gentleman, who, on this occasion, kept pressing on adamantly. I concluded that, on the previous rounds, he had but flexed his muscles.\n“So this is your great day,” I said to Yuan Ming as we joined the crowd milling to the exit door.\n“It was exciting, Uncle,” she conceded; “it really was!”\nOn the way out, we were joined by Jack Levine. For a while, he talked to me, enquiring about Yuan Min’s background. Unexpectedly, we were interrupted by David Schwarz’s shrill voice: “Need a lift back to London, Jacob?”\n“Didn’t you come on the shuttle bus?” asked Jack Levine.\n“Too slow, too slow. I’ve the hotel’s limousine waiting outside the gate. So what d’you say?”\nAs the two proceeded to the front door, with David Schwarz in the lead, Jack Levine turned back and, to my surprise, winked.\n“You had quite a chat with Jack Levine, Uncle,” said Yuan Ming.\n“He seems a nice chap; and he admires your work!”\n“What you mean, Uncle, is that he is a nice chap because he speaks well of my work. But, yes, Jack Levine is alright. And so is David Schwarz, despite his manner.”\n“I suppose so,” I said grudgingly; “but how good is he? They way he talks and dresses doesn’t inspire confidence.”\n“You are prejudiced, Uncle. I know, he isn’t as smooth as a London art critic or Art dealer. But you mustn’t judge him by their yardstick. Why don’t you have a guess at his background.”\n“I suppose his father was grocer in Brooklyn or a tailor on the Bronx!”\n“His father was a famous attorney.”\n“And our friend?” I asked bewildered.\n“Young David wanted to be an artist; so he defied Dad and went to an Art School. Later on, when he realised he wasn’t much good, he decided to become an Art dealer. And he has made a success of it.”\n“The Midas touch?”\n“That too; but he has an excellent appreciation of art and a discerning eye. He has backed some of the leading artists of today: some Americans, some Israelis and, more recently, a handful of Chinese and Burmese.”\n“Oh very well,” I gave in, “it takes all kinds to make the world.”\n“Yes, Uncle: even the world of art. But we better look for Alan Jones. Remember we want to see the other rooms of this house.”\n15. A Remarkable Suite Alan Jones was waiting for us in the foyer. As the Real Estate Agent had to keep another appointment, he volunteered to take us through the house on his own.\n“I’m sorry you missed out on ‘Dawn’, Sir,” he said to me.\n“I’m glad it fetched such an excellent price. I’m sure this will boost the artist’s morale.”\n“So it should,\u0026quot; he agreed. There had been no change in his tone or expression; but his swift glance in Yuan Ming’s direction told me that Alan Jones was both smart and discreet.\nAs soon as the last patron left the building, Alan Jones led the way to a corridor hidden behind a heavy curtain. It took him a while to find the right key but, eventually, he unlocked the door leading to the inner rooms of the house.\nWe started our tour in the huge modernised kitchen, separated by a swinging door from a dining alcove. The brass and glass table and four matching chairs contrasted pleasantly with the heavy rosewood furniture in the elegant yet impersonal dining room in the public part of the house. We then went through a set of unfurnished and poorly carpeted rooms. They were in a shabby condition, requiring a general upgrading following years of neglect. A few broken picture frames leaning against the walls, told me that these rooms had been used to store paintings.\nThe staircase to the second story was another eyesore. The carpet was in tatters and the varnish on the rail had perished. Only the servant quarters had been refurbished.\n“I won’t take you to the third floor,” said Alan Jones. “I suspect nobody has climbed up for years.”\n“Bringing this house up to scratch would be a challenge,” mused Yuan Ming.\n“It could also be extremely expensive,” said Alan Jones. “Our tradesmen say the entire plumbing and wirings are in need of repair or replacement.”\nBack at the ground floor, after a slow and wary descent down the ramshackle staircase, Yuan Ming pointed to a corridor we had bypassed when we entered.\n“And what sort of rooms are these?” she asked.\n“They were Sir Arthur’s living quarters,” confided Alan Jones. “I’m not supposed to let anyone in.”\n“Could we perhaps have a peep” she asked, smiling at him ingratiatingly.\nFor just a moment, Alan Jones hesitated. Then, with a shrug of his shoulders, he produced his key ring. “I can’t see why not; but we better be quick about it.”\nA wing of the house had been converted into a self-contained suite. The small entrance hall, with an umbrella stand and a coat cupboard, led to a spacious sitting room: well furnished, comfortable but lacking in pomp. I could visualise the late Sir Arthur Smithies relaxing in the large armchair with its worn leather upholstery, his feet resting on the stool and the remote control gadget in his hand. Had he watched the daily television programmes or old films stored on video cassettes? A perusal of the cabinet brought a smile to my face. On its middle shelf, two Tony Hancock cassettes rubbed shoulders with Jacques Tati’s films.\nA high fidelity set was placed against another wall. It had both a turn-table and a compact disk player. Few records were placed on the stand but the compact disks cabinet was full to its brims with choice performances of classical and modern pieces. Obviously, Arthur Smithies had discarded most of his records, replacing them with the better sounding and more durable compact disks.\nRaising my head from the musical corner, my eye rested on a large discoloured space on the slightly damp wall.\n“Was ‘Dawn’ hanging here?” I asked.\n“I believe it was” confirmed Alan Jones.\nThe same homely, relaxed, atmosphere reigned in the study. The desk and chair turned out to be old acquaintances. Both came from Arthur Smithies’ office in Birchin Lane. As in a trance, I walked over to the large book case and the collapsible library steps placed in front it. My own books were resting on a shelf devoted to law. A large cardboard box, stationed beside them, was labelled “Berger’s offprints”. Right beneath them, amongst works on copyright and patents, I came across a thin unfamiliar tome. The title imprinted on its back read: “Introduction to the Law of Patents” by Arthur Smithies, BA MA (Cantab.), of the Middle Temple, Barrister at Law.\nA splendid array of old master and modern prints and lithographs decorated the walls. Yuan Ming and Alan Jones became immersed in William Blake’s ‘The Three Friends Accusing Job’.\n“Isn’t it profound, Uncle?” asked Yuan Ming. “The way each of the ‘friends’ points his finger at the stricken patriarch.”\n“Quite a devastating indictment of human nature,” I consented. “And what do you think of it, Mr Jones?”\n“It is brilliant,” he agreed; “but I couldn’t live with it. It’s too depressing. Coming to think of it, so are the other prints in this room.”\n“Is it because they are so candid about human frailties?” asked Yuan Ming. She had been staring, fascinated, at Rembrandt’s Eve tempting Adam by pressing the forbidden apple possessively against her bare bosom whilst the snake was smiling malevolently.\n“Perhaps,” said Alan Jones. “The truth be told: I do find the scenes of the hunt and of the stormy seas more pleasing.”\n“Coming to think of it,” I changed the subject rather abruptly, “are there no traditional English paintings in the suite?”\n“Wait till you see the bedroom” said Alan Jones, breaking into a smile.\nThe comfortable double bed had a traditional brass frame and headboard. On the wall above hung a large rural scene mounted in a simple wooden frame.\n“Constable?” I asked assertively.\n“It is: an unrecorded Constable; and he left it to the National Gallery,” replied Alan Jones with an unexpected display of emotion.\nYuan Ming was captivated by the fine landscape. My less interested eye started to rove around the room. A sliding door opened to the bathroom. Its modern basin, tub and fittings were of the finest quality. But there was no trace of the extravagant splendour of the bathroom in the public part of the house.\nAlan Jones’ discreet cough reminded us that our visit was supposed to be brief. At the very same moment, though, I caught sight of a small rectangular show case in one of the corners of the room.\n“Uncle,” asked Yuan Ming whose glance had followed mine, “are these the cup and saucer?”\n“They are indeed,” I responded in a voice turned inaudible.\nApart from my own gift, the show case contained a few enamel snuff boxes and some silver cups and tankards which, I felt certain, were gifts from staff and from satisfied clients. I then spotted a small brocade box housing a locket. One miniature photograph was of Arthur Smithies in his twenties; the other depicted a girl with a stylish coiffure, an aquiline nose and Nordic features. A full calf bound edition of “Great Expectations” occupied the lowest shelf.\n“Were you looking for this cup and saucer in the first preview?” asked Alan Jones in a voice that allayed my fears of testing his patience. “Diane told me you asked if we had such a piece in the auction.”\n“It’s Vienna, about 1804. I gave it to him when I finished my Oxford thesis: he had been most helpful to me.”\n“So you did know him quite well?”\n“I thought I did,” I heard myself say; “but I’m not so sure any longer: this suite – it is full of surprises.”\n“Is it the contrast between this suite and the other rooms?” asked Alan Jones.\n“That too, although, even before I saw this suite, I found it hard to associate those showy rooms with the man I knew.”\n“What is it then?” asked Yuan Ming.\n“The decor. I didn’t know and would have never guessed that Arthur Smithies collected prints and had an interest in modern art.”\n“But you knew about ‘Dawn’?” she pointed out.\n“I thought it was a one off; but alright then: perhaps I should have expected to find some other modern paintings. But how about the prints? He knew I was a collector. Occasionally, I talked to him about prints I had seen in auctions. But he never referred to his own interest!”\n“He was quite secretive about it,” said Alan Jones. “He got most of his prints from dealers in Vienna and Paris; and, from time to time, he commissioned these dealers to bid in our own auctions on his behalf but in their names!”\n“How about his English paintings” I asked “did he get them at Christie’s?”\n“Quite a few of them; when he couldn’t attend, Diane took his telephone bids. And he got his porcelain in London auctions. Diane liked to handle his bids: she said he was a ‘real gent’.”\n“How do you explain this secrecy about the prints?” I asked.\n“We have no idea. But I can tell you this much: he did everything he could to cover his tracks. Apart from some three or four prints which he left to a friend in the City, the collection is to be sold in our next sale of prints as ‘the property of a Gentleman’. His will precluded their inclusion in the sale of his household!”\n“I can’t make head or tails of this scenario,” I said after a pause.\n“Neither can we,” confessed Alan Jones.\n“I take it that he did not admit guests into these rooms,” I added as an afterthought.\n“He didn’t,” said Alan Jones emphatically. “The servants say he received all his guests in the open part of the house. But he didn’t really have many callers. During the last few years, he led the life of a recluse.”\nI could sense that Yuan Ming wanted to get out of the orphaned suite. I, too, craved for a breath of fresh air. When we were back in the open rooms, Yuan Ming said to Alan Jones: “Thanks for showing us the house; but it’s too big and the renovations are bound to be expensive.”\n“I understand,” smiled Alan Jones. “Well, our agent might have something more suitable in Banbury or in Iffley. I’ve got his card with me.” Handing it to Yuan Ming, he added: “I believe one of the houses in Iffley has a loft, which could be easily converted into a nice studio with an excellent view.”\nWe returned to the car park on the last shuttle bus. Most of the other passengers were Christie’s employees. The snippets of their conversation, which reached my ears, centred on ‘Dawn”. They, too, had found the bidding exciting.\n“I think I better drive us back to London” said Yuan Ming when we got back to our car. “You look shattered, Uncle.”\n“I am, rather,” I confessed. “I still find a great deal of what we’ve seen in these rooms incomprehensible!”\n“I’m sure we’ll find the right answers sooner or later, Uncle,” she replied, patting my shoulder.\n16. A Solomon Judgment Next morning, my taxi stopped in front of Bill Riggs’ office block at 8.55 a.m. The solicitors, their assistants, the other party’s expert and the two fighting cocks were already seated around the conference table. Two elderly gentleman came in shortly thereafter. These, whispered Bill Riggs, were the Chairmen of the Boards of the two companies. They had, apparently, held a brief preliminary meeting in an adjacent room.\nSir Osbert Davies kept us waiting for 15 minutes. I had my first surprise when he arrived: he was none other than the portly gentleman of the auction at Woodstock. I was startled again after he had walked resolutely to the Chair, mumbling some apologies for being late. Just before he took his seat, he winked at me conspiratorially!\nThereafter business was brisk. Within a few minutes Sir Osbert made it clear that he failed to comprehend why the dispute had not been settled amicably. The two firms had enjoyed an excellent business relationship for years and had to continue trading with each other. Small disagreements and disputes had to be sorted out without fuss. If the two companies destroyed their joint operations by petty mindedness, foreign competitors would eagerly pick up the business.\n“It’s a matter of principle” said Whitehead.\n“What principle?” asked Sir Osbert.\n“Of honesty in dealings!” Pointing his finger at Blackburn, Whitehead added furiously: “This fellow must not be allowed to get away with his filthy pack of lies!”\n“How dare you, you \u0026hellip;” started Blackburn, but was cut short by Sir Osbert:\n“I am not going to tolerate any abusive language in this meeting – and this goes for both of you: Philip Whitehead and Tony Blackburn. I just won’t have it!” He had raised his voice but his eyes, I noticed, remained cold.\n“But surely, I have the right to express my views,” said Whitehead defensively.\n“As long as you express them civilly,” answered Sir Osbert severely. “Our object today is to sort things out – not to perpetuate a petty personal feud.”\n“I resent that,” exclaimed Whitehead, raising his voice in a vain attempt to regain his previous position of strength; “you have no right to bring club gossip to \u0026hellip;”.\n“I have the right to control this meeting and I intend to exercise it. You better get that straight, Philip!”\n“How dare you speak to me like that” yelled Whitehead; “who do you think \u0026hellip;”\n“Shut up, Philip, shut up!” interrupted Sir Osbert in a tone that brought a flush to Whitehead’s face.\nFor the next half hour, Sir Osbert went through the documents pertaining to the dispute, including the depositions of the witnesses of fact and the experts’ reports. His analysis, I thought, was lucid and well balanced. He concluded – as had all of us before him – that the outcome of the case depended on the Judge\u0026rsquo;s assessment of the reliability of the two main witnesses: Whitehead and Blackburn. His reasoning, he added, was based on the useful reports of the two expert witnesses.\n“But Professor Berger concludes that we are in the right,” insisted Whitehead.\n“Care to comment, Professor?” asked Sir Osbert.\n“What I say is that, if the Judge accepts Mr Whitehead’s testimony, we ought to win the case,” I explained.\n“But you show that the documents support what I say!” persisted Whitehead.\n“I show in my Report that some documents do; but I have had to concede that other documents go against us.”\n“But that’s double Dutch,” exclaimed Whitehead.\n“No, it isn’t,” intervened Sir Osbert. “Mr Barlow for the other side had to make similar concessions. Professor Berger, am I right in concluding that in this type of situation the Judge has to base his decision on his personal assessment of the witnesses?”\n“Precisely,” I agreed.\n“But how could he possibly believe Blackburn?” wailed Whitehead. “His story doesn’t make sense.”\n“It does – much more so than your confused letters!” countered Blackburn, who had kept his tempter until this moment.\n“Only the Judge will decide which version makes sense,” said Sir Osbert. “Professor Berger, could you please tell us how a Judge makes up his mind in this type of case?”\n“When the facts are neatly balanced,” I said readily, “the Judge can use only one criterion: his own subjective assessment of the witnesses. So the outcome is bound to depend on whether he believes A or B. Most judges hate this type of situation and try to persuade the parties to settle. But if the parties don’t reach an agreement, the Judge has to decide.”\n“But I’m positive he’ll believe me,” Whitehead\u0026rsquo;s voice was charged with emotion; “it’s a matter of simple justice.”\n“Famous last words,” said Sir Osbert Davies contemptuously. “As the Professor has just indicated, the Judge has to rely on his impressions and, of course, the Judge is human. I consider it impossible to predict the outcome. I gather Professor Berger and Mr Barlow are, basically, of the same view. Can we have the views of the legal advisers?”\n“We are of the same view,” said Bill Riggs, whilst his counterpart simply said: “I Agree.”\n“In the circumstances,” said Sir Osbert, “I consider it imperative that the case be settled forthwith. I have studied the draft agreement dated 29 April and consider it a fair and just solution. I urge both parties to accept it as is!”\n“And if we don’t?” asked Whitehead, trying to sound defiant.\n“Then I shall recommend to my bank that we withdraw the facilities granted to both firms.” Sir Osbert did not raise his voice, but the reaction of all the businessmen in the room left no doubt about the impact left by his words. Unperturbed, he continued: “As you well know, both companies experienced certain financial setbacks during the last few years. Acting as the lead bank, we took a substantial risk when we arranged the syndicated loan facilities I am referring to. We went ahead despite this risk because we concluded that the operations of both companies were of considerable importance to British trade. But I am not prepared to assume any further risks, or to throw good money after bad, when the two companies indulge themselves in the pursuit of petty quarrels.”\n“We can get our funding elsewhere,” countered Whitehead in a new fit of rage; “you are pointing a pistol at our heads.”\n“I am indeed,” affirmed Sir Osbert. “And you better cool down before you make me pull the trigger. Once again, I urge each company to place the proposed settlement forthwith before a meeting of its Board of Directors.”\n“Perhaps I should mention that, following a short meeting of the two Chairmen earlier this morning, such meetings have already been called; I understand each Board is to meet this afternoon,” volunteered Bill Riggs.\n“Quite so,” said the two Chairmen in unison.\n“Without consulting me?” asked Whitehead; turning to his own Chairman he added with a touch of bitterness: “I thought I was the General Manager.”\n“So you are,” replied his Chairman. “But this case has gone out of hand and I have felt for some time that a settlement is desirable. As Sir Osbert has explained at the outset, our two companies have to go on cooperating in our trading activities. Our Board’s meeting is scheduled for 4.00 p.m. in our Convention Room. Your presence, Philip, will, of course, be appreciated.”\n“I do not propose to come,” said Whitehead, who had turned pale.\n“As you wish,” answered his Chairman; “still, in your own interest, you ought to be there. Why don’t you think the matter over during lunch.” For a moment, I thought Whitehead was going to reply. Then, to everyone’s relief, he rose from his seat and left the room.\n“How about you, Tony?” asked the other company’s Chairman.\n“Do you think I should attend?” asked Blackburn who, though deflated, had remained in control of himself. “I mean, do you consider my presence desirable?”\n“You should attend, especially if you feel you are able to accept the proposed settlement.”\n“On final reflection,” said Blackburn with an effort, “I believe I can live with it.”\nAll in attendance started to collect their documents. Before we rose, Bill Riggs thanked Sir Osbert Davies. He, in turn, asked the parties to contact him if they felt that he could be of further assistance. I was getting ready to take my leave but was pre-empted by Sir Osbert: “Can I give you a lift, Professor Berger?”\n17. Recognising an Old Friend On our way to the carpark, we talked about the case. To my surprise, Sir Osbert made a number of favourable comments about Philip Whitehead. He praised the policies Whitehead had pursued during his five years with his company and described his conduct in the instant dispute as out of character. Then, as I fastened the safety belt, Sir Osbert said without a change in his voice:\n“Hopefully, Philip Whitehead will soon be back to normal. But, be this as it may, I only hope you didn’t find our stormy meeting too trying, Peter!”\n“Not at all” I replied mechanically; then, as the gist of his address sank in, I looked at him in poorly disguised amazement.\n“You are somewhat slow to recognise an old friend” he said with a smile.\nFor a few seconds I stared at him searchingly. Then, at long last, the smoke lifted itself. Camouflaged behind the double chin, the receding hair, the thick glasses and the wrinkled face, I recognised my acquaintance of days long gone bye:\n“Brian \u0026hellip;?”\n“Have I really changed that much?” he asked sadly and, whilst I was searching for words, went on: “I suppose it’s the effect of all these expense account luncheons, the sumptuous dinners, the endless drinks and, between you and me, my not exercising enough.”\n“It’s not your appearance” I told him truthfully. “It is, rather, your proper name, although I should have really known: I knew your initials were B.R.O. But, you see, although I’ve lived in Anglo-Saxon societies for years, I’m still \u0026hellip;”\n“Occasionally perplexed by our impervious ways?”\n“You could put it like that, Brian \u0026hellip; I mean, Sir Osbert.”\n“I’m still ‘Brian’ to my old friends!”\n“Let me congratulate you, belatedly, on your Knighthood. Was it for your work in the Gulf?”\n“That, and my contributions to certain Committees. Some people thought it came earlier than deserved.”\n“I’m sure that’s nonsense,” I said, once again myself. “But, I hope you don’t mind if I ask: what made you prefer ‘Osbert’ to ‘Brian’?\u0026quot;\n“But I didn’t,\u0026quot; he burst out laughing. “It was, rather, Ruth’s idea. She thought that ‘Sir Osbert Davies’ sounded better than ‘Sir Brian Davies’.” Noting my perplexed glance, he added: “Not that Ruth has become a snob; she’s still the same old girl. But she had always liked the sound of ‘Osbert’.”\n“And what did Mary Jane and Jonathan have to say – I take it they were consulted?”\n“So you have a better memory for names than for faces,” said Brian, gratified. “And, yes, they were consulted. Mary Jane agreed with Mom. She said the ‘Nobs’ had no monopoly over ‘fine’ English names. Jonathan was neutral: he said that to him I’ll always be Dad.”\n“I see; but tell me: what are Mary Jane and Jonathan doing?”\n“Mary Jane is a vet – one of the few women in the profession. She practises although she is married and has two kids. Jonathan did electronic engineering but, some two years ago, joined a business firm. He says he’ll make his first million before he’s thirty five!”\n“Good luck to him,” I said, slightly amused. “And is he married?”\n“Not formally. But he has been living with the same girl since his University days. She rules him just as firmly as his Mom rules his Dad! They say they’ll get married if they decide to have children. At first Ruth urged them to do the right thing presently; but later on she accepted the situation. She has become very fond of Rosalind and treats her like a daughter.”\n“And where do you live now? I remember you bought a property in Stanmore.”\n“We’re still living there. I wanted to move to an Edwardian house in Mayfair a few years ago but Ruth was against it. So I purchased our neighbour’s house and converted the two into one large property. Ruth drew the basic plan. It’s turned out very nicely.”\n“I’m delighted, Brian.”\n“And how are things with you, Peter? You have done very well professionally: Arthur Smithies used to tell me about your work. But how is everything else? Did you move back to Singapore for your wife’s sake?”\n“Partly,” I told him truthfully. “It was the best thing I could do for her. But there were other attractions like the salary and, frankly speaking, something personal. You see, my marriage has not been a great success. Still, Pat and I are still together; but during the last few years, Brian, \u0026hellip; a ray of light has entered into my life.”\n“The young woman who was with you at the auction?”\n“Her name is Yuan Ming. I told you a great deal about her the last time we met!”\n“But that was ages ago!” Brian gave a start. “Hold on,” he proceeded, “so she is the little girl you talked about over our lunch, isn’t she?”\n“She is, rather. We had lost touch when I left Singapore and then, when I had almost given up all hope of seeing her and her father again, I stumbled into their new shop!”\n“What a strange coincidence!” His voice remained even but, for just a flicker, his expression changed perceptibly. “I recall our conversation clearly. You appeared engrossed in your work and steered back to it when I asked about your personal life. But your face lit up when you told me about little Yuan Ming: you became animated. And I assume ‘Dawn’ is her work, isn’t it?”\n“It is” I said and kept talking about Yuan Ming and her art until we reached Marble Arch.\n“I’m glad to see you are happy, Peter, I really am. And, Peter, are you free for lunch?”\n“I am: only it’s my turn really.”\n“Nonsense. You’ll take me out when I visit you in Singapore.”\n18. Lunch Down Memory Lane After some fifteen minutes we stopped in front of a smart restaurant in Mayfair. Leaving the car in charge of a valet, Sir Osbert Davies – whose role Brian played to perfection – led the way to a table at a bay window. The deference of the waiters and of the Chef, who stepped out of the kitchen to welcome him, brought a discreet smile to my face. Still, once he had ordered our meals and a bottle of wine, my host metamorphosed again into his old alter ego.\nAs was to be expected, we spent some time exchanging news about common friends in the English banking and business world, savouring the success of some and the untimely retirement or demise of others. Eventually, under the influence of the excellent wine, Brian started to talk happily about his grandchildren.\nA short lull in our conversation took place when a waiter uncorked the second bottle. When he departed, I steered the conversation to Sir Arthur Smithies. I was not surprised to learn that Brian had, occasionally, called on him in Epping and that, more recently, he had dinner with him in Woodstock.\n“We had a drink in the library followed by a formal dinner in that huge dining room.”\n“Just the two of you?”\n“Quite. It gave me an uncanny feeling.”\n“Didn’t you find the entire house weird, Brian?” I asked.\n“I wouldn’t put it that strongly; but, yes, I was puzzled.”\n“Because it was out of character?”\n“Not really; it struck me was as a place suitable for housing Arthur Smithies’ collection. I was, rather, surprised not to find certain things in it.”\n“Such as?”\n\u0026ldquo;His old desk, for instance. Roger Bates told me that Arthur Smithies had personally supervised the removal of his desk and chair from his old office. Later on, I spotted them in his study in Epping. Their replacement by the grand desk and elegant chair in the Woodstock house was out of character.”\n“Anything else, in the house or, perhaps, at the auction?” I wanted to know.\n“Well,” he said after an inner struggle, “I think it’s alright to tell you about it now: Arthur Smithies had a fine collection of prints. I still wonder why there was no trace of them at the auction.”\n“The answer is simple, Brian” I told him. “The prints as well as the desk and office chair are in a self contained suite, or bachelor’s flat, on the ground floor. This was Arthur Smithies’ real abode.”\n“How on earth did you find out?” Brian looked thunderstruck.\n“Yuan Ming and I gained access to it yesterday, after the auction.”\nBrian Davies listened attentively to my description of Arthur Smithies’ hidden rooms. He interrupted me for the first time when I described the books I saw in the study.\n“Did you have a good look at the shelves with the English novels?”\n“I’m afraid not,” I had to admit. “Do you have a specific book in mind?”\n“As a matter of fact, I do. It’s ‘Great Expectations’.”\n“A fine full calf bound edition?”\n“Precisely,” he said eagerly.\n“It’s not on the shelves. It is, rather, in a cabinet in which he kept gifts and trophies. A Vienna cup and saucer I gave him before I left Oxford is also there.”\n“I know them. He showed them to me shortly after you went to Singapore,” said Brian, overtly moved. “The book is from me. I presented it to him when he left Crawfords. Can you recall any other items you saw in the cabinet?”\nBrian was able to identify some snuff boxes. He then turned, somewhat uneasily, to the locket.\n“During his early years at the Bar, Arthur Smithies was often seen in the company of Vivian Armstrong, a successful Chancery Junior from the Chambers in 11-12, Grey’s Inn Square. Rumour had it that they were engaged to be married. But, in the end, no announcement was made and they appear to have drifted apart. I’m sure she gave him the locket.”\n“What a pity they didn’t get married.”\n“I am not sure I agree with you. Arthur Smithies was very much his own man. He might have found it hard to accept the everyday compromises dictated by marriage.”\nBrian was equally interested in my description of the remaining rooms in the suite. He wanted details about the prints. I was impressed when he identified a number of them from my description. Some turned out to be rare and valuable.\n“Brian,” I asked when I had completed my description of the suite, “why, on earth, did Arthur Smithies lead such a schizophrenic existence? I mean, why did he need both the opulent open rooms and the hidden suite. I have no doubt that he felt at home in the suite. So why did he need the façade of the other rooms. I am satisfied that Arthur Smithies was not a show-off.”\n“Of course not,” confirmed Brian. “What bothers you about the two separate pArt of the house?”\n“They are incompatible with each other!”\n“Viewed as two homes, they are,” he answered readily. “But the open rooms were not meant to be Arthur Smithies’ home. They were the rooms of a grand mansion, housing his collection of artefacts. He wanted his guests to enjoy them. The suite was his living quarters: the place in which he dressed informally, discarding his suit and putting on a pullover or cardigan and a comfortable pair of trousers: the place in which he relaxed and felt at home.”\n“But why did he keep its existence in the dark. You were, I believe, close to him. But even you were never told, let alone invited to enter these rooms?”\n“As you well know, Peter, Arthur Smithies was a very reserved man, who cherished his privacy. Perhaps he felt that the existence of these ‘hidden rooms’ was no one else’s business.”\n“Isn’t this an extreme example of the privacy fetish; doesn’t it verge on the absurd?”\n“Perhaps it does, Peter,” conceded Brian; “but, then, Arthur Smithies was an unusual man.”\n“And why this secrecy about the prints? He never mentioned them in his letters to me although he knew I was a fellow collector. He was, at the same time, communicative about his Meissen artefacts. Actually, I wonder if you were the only person who knew about his collection of prints.”\n“Perhaps I was; and, as a matter of fact, I found out by chance.”\n“How?”\n“I met him in a dealer’s shop in Amsterdam. When I came in, he was in the process of paying for a Goya. He reacted like a boy caught with jam on his fingers. Still, the cat was out the bag and so we started to talk about prints. He was quite knowledgeable.”\n“This still doesn’t explain why he was so secretive about them. And, Brian, how can one man have an interest in both these prints and in the paintings we have seen on the walls of the house?”\n“I quite agree with your assessment of these paintings. I made those bids for ‘Galleons off Yarmouth’ to boost Roger Bates’ ego. I didn’t want him to sense that no one else in the room had an interest in his dream painting.”\n“I see; and you are a very kindly man, Brian.”\n“Oh, come off it,” said Brian suddenly all flustered. “It was just a supportive gesture.”\n“But how about the contrast between the prints in the ‘hidden rooms’ and the paintings?”\n“I can’t be certain,” said Brian, after having pondered for a while; “but let’s see if we can come up with a good hunch. Basically, how would you describe these prints?”\n“All of them deal with human emotions: Eve’s insatiable curiosity; Man’s cruelty in war; the horror inspired by the apocalypse and so and so on.”\n“And the paintings?”\n“They are expressions of harmony and grandeur: of Man’s achievements.”\n“These, of course, suit the elegant furniture, the fine porcelain with its quaint paintings, and they are in harmony with the atmosphere Arthur Smithies’ grand house.”\n“Quite so,” I agreed.\n“Perhaps,” said Brian reflectively, “these paintings – and the open rooms as a whole – represent the solidity toward which, Arthur Smithies felt, we ought to strive. The prints reflect the controversies of life, the emotions and obsessions which drive us, every now and then, to irrational actions.”\n“Like Philip Whitehead’s behaviour,” it was my turn to reflect.\n“Precisely,” agreed Brian readily. “I believe that, in his own way, Arthur Smithies was both aware of the effects of inner turmoil and was mesmerised by them.”\n“That,” I said “would also explain what attracted him to ‘Dawn’ and the other modern, abstract but highly emotive, paintings displayed in his ‘hidden rooms’.\n“Spot on,” said Brian.\n“How very strange,” I said after a pause. “How very strange that a man of Arthur Smithies’ background would reflect on these aspects of life. I knew, of course, that he was a sensitive and sophisticated man. But I had not realised that he had stepped so far out into the \u0026hellip; twilight zone.”\n“But, Peter, how much do you really know about Arthur Smithies background?”\n“Not much; I assumed that – like yourself – he came from the ranks of the professional middle classes.”\n“Wrong on both points,\u0026rdquo; said Brian, who, to my relief, was amused rather than annoyed by what had, obviously, been a gaff.\n\u0026ldquo;How?\u0026rdquo; I asked.\n“Well, my father was a businessman in Peterborough. He was quite successful but we were a long shot removed from the ‘professional’ upper middle classes.”\n“But your accent,” I said bewildered. “To me it didn’t - and still doesn’t - sound ‘Midlands’.”\n“So I’ve fooled you about my accent, haven’t I?” said Brian in such a heavy Midlands accent that I broke into a smile.\n“You rather have! When did you change over?”\n“Just before I went up to Cambridge. It was really mom’s idea. She doted on me and did everything she could to ensure my ‘future’. One of her best ideas was to persuade me to ‘learn to speak English like a real gentleman’. It helped me in my interview at King’s and opened the doors to Crawfords.” Smiling at me, he added: “ ‘Osbert’, too, was her idea. She thought that such a fine proper name would stand me in good stead at the right time.”\n“Alright, then,” I came back to my main point; “but you said I was wrong twice. So what was Arthur Smithies background? He appeared the epitome of an executive in an English aristocratic bank.”\n“He was; and he had the necessary credentials and the appropriate upbringing,” agreed Brian. “But the full story is considerably more complex than what meets the eye. You see, Peter, Arthur Smithies’ great grandfather was a successful businessman in Manchester. His name, I gather, was Peter Smith or, possibly, Peter Schmidt.”\n“A migrant from Germany?”\n“He was, I am told, born in England. His father had migrated either, as you suggest, from Germany or from the Netherlands. After he had made his fortune, Peter Smith came down to London to look for even bigger and better opportunities. Well, it didn’t take him long to find a suitable target. The City was, at that time, full of rumours about certain financial difficulties faced by Crawford, Fairbairn, Miles, Lawson \u0026amp; Co. Concluding that merchant bank had a sound base, Peter Smith injected the capital required for its recovery; and he married Juliana Crawford, third daughter of the senior partner, a girl some twenty years younger than himself.”\n“Quite a man!” I broke in. “And, obviously, his financial gamble paid off.”\n“Didn’t it ever!” affirmed Brian. “Within ten years the bank regained its prominent position and established excellent relations with some Dutch and German banks. It soon became an intermediary for trade between the East Coast of the United States and Central Europe.”\n“And the bank remained a sort of family business.”\n“It did. The partners consolidated the bank’s standing by marrying into the families of successful lawyers and of wealthy businessmen and industrialists in Britain, the Continent and the States. Some of them joined the bank. So it changed its name from time to time; and the ‘Smiths’ changed their name to ‘Smithies’.”\n“How did Arthur Smithies get into the lead. I though he had opted for a career at the Bar?”\n“He did, rather. But circumstances dictated his final move. Originally, his older brother, Archibald, was considered more suitable for the job. Archie was a an easy going, affable, man with all the social graces. People liked to deal with him. Arthur, in contrast, was a reserved and shy young man. But he had his ancestors’ sharp mind. A career at the Bar appeared just right for him.”\n“I believe I can put the rest of the jigsaw together.” I nodded. “He had a successful start at the Bar and, eventually, chose to specialise in a newly developing field: copyright and patents. I suspect that – in due course – Archibald proved himself unable to handle the affairs of the Bank during times of turbulence. So the sedate and resourceful Arthur had to take over. Was it a family decision?”\n“It was.”\n“So, all in all,” I mused, “far from being the scion of a pure old English family, Arthur Smithies came from a somewhat \u0026hellip; mixed background?”\n“You are surprised, aren’t you?” grinned Brian.\n“I am: to me he appeared a typical upper middle class Englishmen.”\n“He left that impression on most people he met; and I don’t think it was a mere façade. In most ways, he was just that.”\n“But, at the same time, there were some other inner forces pulling him in very different directions.”\n“I think so,” said Brian, “but we can’t be certain.”\n“True,” I had to agree; “but what you’ve just told me sheds new light on the public section of the house and on the ‘hidden room’. Their coexistence no longer appears incompatible with his character. Like Arthur Smithies’ background and outlook they were moulded by chance!”\n“Chance,” replied Brian vigorously, “or, as I prefer to put it, a series of events each triggered off by another, like the ripples created by a pebble thrown into a clear pool.” Breaking into a smile, he went on: “And now, Peter, you know as much about Arthur Smithies’ background as myself!”\n“Thanks for telling me” I said.\n“Anything else you like to know?” he asked, still smiling.\n“As a matter of fact there is: do you know what became of Vivian Armstrong?”\n“She died of an attack of pneumonia, just a few years after Arthur Smithies joined Crawfords. I was told he appeared subdued during that period and dressed even more sombrely than usually. And, Peter, I know for sure that Vivian Armstrong remained single.”\nTaking advantage of the lull in our conversation, the waiter came over to fill our coffee cups and to remove our dessert plates. Having found out all I wanted to know about my late friend, I thought it appropriate to steer the conversation back to Brian’s own affairs. He told me, willingly, about his position in his merchant bank and his general role in London’s thriving banking community. He was, obviously, pleased to talk about his achievements but, at the same time, his tone remained sober. He became more enthusiastic when I asked about his collection of prints.\n“My collection has been growing steadily over the years. You may recall that I prefer modern prints to the old masters. I have prints of all the modern leading artists, excellent prints! To tell you the truth, Peter, I am giving serious thought to early retirement from the bank. If I do, I shall turn my hobby into a lucrative business.”\n“But, surely, you cannot possibly open an art gallery, can you?”\n“As ‘Brian Davies’ I could; but, as you imply, not as ‘Sir Osbert Davies’; and, even if I wanted to defy convention, Ruth won’t let me. Still, one of Mary Jane’s friends has just finished her BA and aspires to become an Art dealer. I have had a chat with her. I would, of course, remain in remote control.”\n“But why do you want to retire from the City. You are at the very peek of your career, Brian!”\n“And that, Peter, is not a bad time to quit. I’d rather go whilst I’m riding high than when I sense the tide has turned and I’ve outlived my usefulness; and, quite apart from that, I am beginning to lose interest. I’ve been at the helm for far too long.”\n“I understand. Sometime I, too, feel fed up with what I’m doing. I’ve been teaching law and writing legal monographs and articles for years. I am getting sick and tired of it.”\n“What do you propose to do?\u0026quot;\n“As soon as I’ve sorted things out, I intend to devote myself to Yuan Ming’s career; and I want to try my hand at some short stories and perhaps a novel.”\n“I’m glad you have made your plans,” said Brian warmly. “You know, Peter, time has not stood still for either of us; but you, too, contemplate a new start: you haven’t lost your aspirations.”\n“I haven’t” I confirmed. “I continue to look forward to the future. But how about Arthur Smithies, Brian, had he lost heart?”\n“I don’t think so” said Brian with conviction. “I believe that in those hidden rooms, the rooms which you have been privileged to see, he was the man both of us knew at Crawfords.”\nDiscreetly, the waiter placed a silver plate with the neatly folded bill next to Brian’s side plate. He settled it in cash and, I noticed, left a generous tip.\nAlthough I should have preferred to walk to Marble Arch Station, I felt obliged to accept Brian’s offer to drop me in front of my hotel. Having exhausted both our personal news and the subject of Arthur Smithies, Brian turned back to the legal proceedings that had brought me to London. It soon emerged that, like myself, he had been moved by Philip Whitehead’s bitterness and was inclined to accept his version of the facts. Both of us, though, were convinced that most judges would come down on the side of the more sedate and dignified Tony Blackburn.\n“In effect,” I told Brian “we delivered a Solomon’s judgment. Being unable to discover conclusive evidence in support of either party we divided the loss in equal shares. ‘A’ didn’t win but ‘B’ didn’t lose. I only hope the episode has not ruined the careers of Blackburn and Whitehead.”\n“Time will tell,” replied Brian.\nShortly thereafter we arrived at the hotel. Shaking his hand warmly, I thanked him for his hospitality. I watched his car until it disappeared around the corner. It was only then that I realised I had been driven in a Bentley.\n19. Rerouting a Flight Back in my room, I kept musing about Brian – now Sir Osbert – Davies, comparing his decisive progress with the slow downhill trend in Arthur Smithies’ career. Was it possible that in our fast moving age a rough diamond had brighter prospects than a polished one? After all, even the finest of diamonds had, in the very least, one flaw.\nMy reverie was disrupted by the four chimes of a nearby clock. Instantly, my mind swung to Yuan Ming. Why had she not rung? Did she go for some shopping? Despite my persistent calls, the receiver in her flat was not picked up. Had there been an unfavourable development respecting her deal? Had some of the pieces proved to be fakes? The purchasers were, undoubtedly, ruthless people. Was she in danger? Anxiously, I started to pace the floor with my arms pressed tightly to my sides. Then, as if in response to a prayer, the telephone rang.\n“So you are back, Uncle!”\n“Yes; but where have you been? It’s nearly four thirty?”\n“Don’t tell me you worried about me? I’m not a ‘little Yuan Ming’ any longer, you know.”\n“It’s just because of the deal; I feared something went wrong!”\n“And the nasty men kidnapped me” she burst out laughing. “They haven’t paid yet: remember! So if they aren’t pleased they can call the deal off. So what would they want with me?”\n“Sorry,” I conceded contritely; “I am getting rather edgy, and it is getting late.”\n“I understand, you Old Silly. I’m late because we went to see the expert on bronzes in the British Museum, who took his time; and then the three of us had a late lunch in Gerard Street. But where have you been: there was no answer when I rang about an hour ago.”\n“Sir Osbert Davies took me out for lunch!”\n“So you are climbing up in the world, Respected Uncle: rubbing shoulders with the high and mighty; soon you’ll rise above the standard of your plain Yuan Ming. Don’t tell me you had been driven in a Silver Hawk?”\n“In a Bentley, rather. But Sir Osbert isn’t really Sir Osbert\u0026hellip;”\n“Uncle, are you reciting ‘The Hunting of the Snark’?”\n“I am not! And Sir Osbert isn’t a Bojum. He is, rather, the portly gentleman who started the bidding on ‘Dawn’ yesterday.”\n“The fat chap who kept staring at us?”\n“The very same. You see, he turned out to be an old friend about whom I’ve told you – I mean ‘her’ – long ago.”\n“Don’t tell me he’s your old friend Brian Davies,” she burst out laughing merrily. “You told ‘her’ he was an elegant, athletic and suave upper middle class young Englishmen! No wonder he tried to attract your attention by bidding for ‘Dawn’. When did you recognise him?”\n“Only on the way to lunch” I admitted; “and look, shall I come over to the flat?”\n“Do. I’ll be there in 20 minutes.”\nYuan Ming greeted me when I arrived. She looked pleased; but I could sense her fatigue.\n“Is all well with your deal, Yuan Ming; and I hope you don’t have to travel to China - right?”\n“Right; the deal is all set and everything is fine.”\n“Thank goodness.”\nDespite my relief, a lump was forming in my chest and throat. In just about twenty four hours, Yuan would be on her way to Heathrow. Shortly thereafter I would be taking my flight to Singapore. Yuan Ming, to my relief, did not display unhappiness.\n“Tell me about your lunch, Uncle” she asked. “You talked about Arthur Smithies, didn’t you?”\n“We did; but do you really want me tell you about it now?”\n“Oh, yes; I’m sure Brian Davies – I mean your Sir Osbert – knew a lot about him.”\nI knew that her main object was to steer my mind away from her imminent return to Los Angeles. All the same, I went ahead. She listened without interruption, except an occasional snicker as I related the funnier aspects of my recent encounter. When I finished, she said with conviction:\n“So your friend Brian – I mean ‘the Honourable Sir Osbert Davies’ – was not altogether surprised to hear about the hidden rooms? He took what you told him in his stride and came up with a ready explanation.”\n“Do you think he is right?”\n“Offhand, and bearing in mind Arthur Smithies’ real background, his view is plausible.”\n“It probably is,” I said, trying to keep my doubts out of my voice.\nNeither of us felt inclined to go on talking. Outwardly, we tried to prolong the discussion of my meeting with Brian Davies and of Arthur Smithies’ mystery. These were the topics of the day. Our thoughts, though, were focusing on our imminent parting. Some six or perhaps even eight months would pass before we met again; and life – alas – was full of uncertainties. We appreciated that an eventual return to our respective bases was unavoidable. Yuan Ming had her art and exhibitions; I had my post at the University. But was there no way to extend our spell of harmony and happiness?\nThen, through the clouds of gloom, I caught sight of the benign face of my late friend, Yuan Ming’s father, the antiques dealer Tay Fang-Shou. In one of our last conversations, he had urged me not to ignore my insights. People like us taught ourselves to be guided by reason. In the process, we lost the ability to act on instincts, although these alone were dictated by the inner self. Man, Tay had explained in our special jargon, was made of flesh and blood. Reason was an acquired dimension. In extreme occasions – when special circumstances made their demands – you had to free yourself of it.\n“Yuan Ming,” I told her when I was certain the time was right; “Yuan Ming: tomorrow I shall fly with you to LA. I know I’ve got to return to Singapore when the academic term stArt; I know you have to decided to settle in LA; and so you should. But I do want to see your exhibition!”\nSlowly a smile crept over her face. “Do you have a visa, Uncle; and can you spare the time?”\n“The old visa is still valid; and, yes, I have the time.”\n“When does your next teaching session begin?”\n“Not until the first week of July!”\n“And how about your consultancy?”\n“I cleared my table before I went to London; and any new matter can wait.”\n\u0026ldquo;But what will you do when my exhibition is on? You can’t be there all the time; and I can’t bear the thought of your sitting around doing nothing.”\n“I’ll have a good rest and, if I feel like it, I’ll go to some matinees in your theatres. Also, I’d like to spend some time in your museums. There must be some museums in LA?”\n“There are. We even have a museum of Judaica; I haven’t been to it yet because I thought we’d go together one day. But alright then: you’ll come with me to LA tomorrow, Uncle; but you must not go to any part of town unless you check with me first and I tell you it’s safe.”\n“So it’s all settled,” I let my delight show. “And it’s sure to be a lovely week, Yuan Ming.”\n“It will be; and you are welcome to my opening and closing sessions.”\n“Splendid” I told her; “and can’t I be of any use to you whilst the exhibition is on?”\n“You can,” she said after a pause. “You can do some of my packing.”\n“I’m not sure I understand.”\n“I’ve really just made up my mind, Uncle. When the exhibition is over, I’ve got to fly to Hong Kong in connection with the deal.”\n“So we can go together” I said eagerly.\n“Yes, Uncle; and after that I’m flying over to Singapore. It’s high time I spend some time back at home.”\n“So we’ll be able to spend plenty of time together!” I said gleefully.\n20. The Impenetrable Mask We had dinner in a Viennese restaurant in Queensway. Left to myself, I should have spent the next morning in the vicinity of the hotel, possibly strolling down Kensington Church Street for a browse in the antique shops. Yuan Ming was more adventurous. Pointing out that the sky was clear, with only an occasional friendly white cloud floating past, she proposed a trip up the Thames.\nIt was a hot May day but a mild breeze, blowing from the East, kept refreshing us on the boat and during our hike in Kew Gardens. The smile on Yuan Ming’s face told me that, like myself, she felt at the top of the world.\nBack at my hotel, where Yuan Ming and I intended to have our dinner at the Law Firm’s expense, I discovered that Bill Riggs had set me a cumbersome, even if pleasant, task. The settlement agreement had been executed without demur by both companies and, shortly before lunch, was given the effect of a decree by a much relieved Judge. With the exception of Philip Whitehead, everybody was smiling. True to form, the two law firms found this an opportune moment for the submission of their accounts. It was, accordingly, imperative that my own fee note be ready before I left London.\n“Well, Uncle” said Yuan Ming enthusiastically; “let’s do it together.”\nShe waited patiently whilst I collected my time-sheets and reconciled them with the entries in my diary. Then, as I started to put the fee note together, she checked my amateurish calculations. Soon it dawned on me that she had a vivid recollection of the fine tuning my little Yuan Ming had introduced long ago – in Singapore – into my bookkeeping and bills. Now and then, she rounded up taxi fares and restaurant bills so as to include the tips and corrected all my wrong additions with an amused grin. The only time she got incensed was when I sought to charge a nominal fee for the period we had spent on the Continent.\n“Come on, Uncle,” she said firmly. “You used to tell ‘her’ that it was customary to charge a waiting-fee of 50% for days a lawyer had made himself available but was not called upon to act.”\n“True” I said; “but we had such a marvellous time during these days. Do you really think I ought to charge a waiting-fee?”\n“But if we had remained in London they would have had to settle the hotel bill and reimburse your running expenses?”\n“I suppose so,” I conceded.\n“So, if your conscience bugs you, why don’t you charge them 33% instead of 50% per day?”\n“Fair enough,” I accepted her verdict.\nWhen the fee note, neatly typed out in the hotel’s Business Centre, had been sent out, we had coffee in the hotel’s lounge . For a while we talked about our European trip and planned a trip through the United States. In due course, though, the conversation turned back to Arthur Smithies. We had no doubt that his craving for independence – verging on an obsession – was the main reason for his decision to remain unattached.\n“But, in truth, our answer begs the question,” Yuan Ming told me. “If a man really loves a woman, he’ll go ahead in any event; and he’ll usually be glad to fall in with her wishes and will accept her plans. And, frequently, she’ll accept his. This is not a loss of independence. It is the willingness to compromise necessitated where the spouse’s happiness is the first priority.”\n“How very true,” I told her. “It means that each party to a happy marriage – a fellowship – has to give up some independence. If one party insists on having his or her way all the time, the fellowship is bound to turn sour. I am sure a man as sensitive and as sophisticated as Arthur Smithies knew this; he wasn’t blind.”\n“But suppose he had another impediment that compounded the first?”\n“Such as?”\nShe was about to tell me but, mercurially, changed her mind. “Uncle,” she said, “let me give you a clue; we’ll see if you find out on your own.”\n“ ‘She’ loved to set me riddles,” I grinned. “So even a young lady doesn’t change her spots? Well, go ahead then.”\n“Let’s start with Dad,” she said. “How many faces did he have?”\n“I knew two: Tay Fang-Shou’s and Dr Alfred Cheng’s: two very different countenances. And, yes, I observed him once leaving the Odeon Cinema with ‘her’ and your Mom. His mannerism was so different that, for a while, I couldn’t be certain it was him.”\n“I’m not surprised. On all family occasions he turned himself into a Chinese family man.”\n“But what has this got to do with Arthur Smithies?”\n“Not so fast, Uncle. How about you? Are you the same with close friends like me, with students, with clients and on formal occasions?”\n“Not really,” I consented, still bewildered.\n“And how about your friend Brian? In this morning’s meeting he was the Hon. Sir Osbert Davies, blah, blah blah; with you he became, once again, Brian; and I won’t be surprised to see our fat Sir Osbert, dressed informally at home, hopping on all fours and braying like a horse, with the two grandchildren riding on his back and shrieking happily! And to the them he is neither Sir Osbert nor Brian Davies: he is Grampa. I’m sure he loves it, but - what is more important - he doesn’t worry about his appearance, or about his ‘mask’!”\n“True,” I said “but I still don’t see\u0026hellip;”\n“So the penny has dropped” she said, taking in the change in my expression as I cut myself short.\n“You are hinting that Arthur Smithies was never seen with his mask off?” I asked.\n“More accurately, Uncle: Arthur Smithies was unable to open up and drop his ‘mask’. It had become part of him!”\n“And that is not something a woman would tolerate in her man – not if she loves him?”\n“Precisely, Uncle. A woman cannot love a man who, even when they are on their own, remains the very person he is in the boardroom.”\n“But suppose he doesn’t have another ‘face’ or ‘alter ego?”\n“I don’t know if there are such men,” she said solemnly. “But even if there are some around, Arthur Smithies wasn’t one of them.”\n“How do you know?”\n“When Alan Jones and you looked at the trophies cabinet I peeked into the wardrobe. What I saw was a give away! His neat business suits were hanging on one side. On the other I saw an old V neck pullover, with the elbows all frayed, an old comfortable jacket, a few pairs of corduroy trousers and a worn out track suit. And, Uncle, the cuffs of some of the trouser legs were covered with dry mud.”\n“So he did some gardening,” I said thoughtfully. “I should have never guessed!”\n“And, Uncle, when you went through his professional books, I took in the other shelves. Well, he had quite a collection of books on gardening and horticulture as well as ‘Teach yourself’ and ‘Do it Yourself’ books on such diverse topics as ‘French Cuisine’ and ‘Carve Your Own Clock Cases and Mantelpieces’.”\n“So he was a man of many hobbies; and, perhaps, he had a well equipped workshop, hidden away in another part of the house. What is so strange is that he never mentioned these hobbies or occupations to anybody!”\n“Just as he didn’t talk about his prints,” she agreed. “Outside his own ‘hidden rooms’ he remained – day in and day out – the \u0026hellip;”\n“\u0026hellip; London banker in the neatly cut and carefully pressed business suit,” I concluded for her.\n“Precisely; and he took off his mask only when he was alone, usually in his suite, the existence of which was known only to the servants.”\n“The ‘hidden rooms’, in which he created a world of his own: a sanctuary not to be disrupted by any other person.”\n“Well put, Uncle; so now you are with me.”\n“All the way,” I confirmed; “but I should still like to know what gave Arthur Smithies the strength to reject Vivian Armstrong and give marriage a miss. He was, after all, a normal young man, with a deep affection for her?”\n“He was a realist, Uncle. He must have appreciated that, to enjoy a happy marriage, he had to change his outlook and his approach to life but felt both unable and unwilling to do so.”\n“What a pity,” I said sadly.\n“No, I don’t agree with you there, Uncle! Happy marriages are rare: you know this. And nobody can tell if Arthur Smithies and Vivian Armstrong would have hit it off, even if he had opened up to her.”\n“How very true.”\n“So perhaps Arthur Smithies made the right decision. He may not have been the happiest of men; but we know he took life as it came and was ‘satisfied with his lot’.”\n“You are right,” I admitted. “But tell me just one more thing: did Arthur Smithies appreciate that he was ‘the man with impenetrable mask’?”\n“I can’t tell; we may never know,” she conceded.\n“And we may not find out why he became like that. Maybe it had something to do with his background or home or, maybe, he was ragged so badly in his public school that he had to teach himself to button up.”\n“Or it might have been – as you would normally preach, Uncle – the outcome of pure chance!”\n21. The Prints Yuan Ming returned to Chelsea after dinner. Back in my room, I packed my suitcase, intending to check out in the morning. I was going to spend the day with her in Chelsea. In the afternoon we would take a taxi to Heathrow.\nWhen I had finished packing, I watched two programmes on BBC. Then, before I retired, my mind strayed once again back to Arthur Smithies. We had found the answers to most of our questions about him. Just one issue remained obscure. Why had he been so secretive about his hobby of collecting prints. There was nothing untoward – let alone shameful – about them. Each was a collectors’ item, bound to fetch a substantial price in an established auction house.\nIn an attempt to find the answer, I let my mind dwell on the prints in the ‘hidden rooms’. Unlike the colourful painting in the public section of the house, most prints were black and white; there were only two colour lithographs. Yet another feature was that the prints highlighted man’s gruesome, untoward, weak and dark side. They also emphasised his blindness and limitations. They were parodies of human nature.\nWas it possible that the Late Sir Arthur did not want anyone to suspect that, behind his benign and imperturbable mask, he was deeply interested in and even moved by human frailties? But, if this was the case, Sir Arthur Smithies’ mask was emblematic of an escape. He was not prepared to give anyone the opportunity to peep through it; and the knowledge of the very existence of the prints might have provided a clue. So it was best to keep it in the dark.\nWas my analysis sound? Unable to come up with a definite answer, I switched off the lights. I wanted to have a good night’s rest prior to the long flight to Los Angeles. Youth was far behind; and an ageing man had to preserve his energies.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-hidden-rooms/chapter-4/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"14-exciting-auction\"\u003e14.

Moti was relieved to find his friend in good shape and unharmed. Giving vent to his joy, he trumpeted. Tiger brushed against Archie’s toga and my slacks. Then, bursting with curiosity, he asked me to tell them all about our venture.\nWhen I completed my narration, Tiger raised a point that had baffled him. Archie must have been aware that Herodotus had lived before his time. Why then had he expected the historian to be familiar with the name of a mathematician yet to be born?\n“I, too, am confused,” interceded Moti. “But then, Tiger’le, don’t you sometimes confuse early with late? Peter’le tells me that the composers of the Old Testament did so regularly.”\n“I don’t know whether they did so intentionally. As to me, I often make mistakes of this sort,” conceded Tiger. “But I won’t upbraid a person before I am sure of my premises. I know that Archie is a hothead – no offence meant of course – but he is rather rational!”\n“Of course I am rational. But you see, my friends, Herodotus too was a mere image. The days on earth of Peter’le and of me were over; but so were Herodotus’. So, surely, he too was shipped back to his own era, or time, by Lord Pan.”\n“Well?” I asked perplexed.\n“Archie means that Herodotus should have identified men of genius of all the periods covered on his journey back in time,” observed Moti.\n“Precisely. You, Moti, always understand what I mean. You are a treasure.”\n“I get the drift,” interposed Tiger, “but then, why do you say Herodotus travelled back in time? Lord Pan could have moved Peter’le and Archie back to Herodotus’ genuine epoch: I mean, his days on earth. Lord Pan didn’t have to transport two segments.”\n“Actually, what is time travel?” asked Moti.\nPatiently and thoroughly, Archimedes explained the well-known nature of the basic three dimensions. He then went on to explain that ‘time’, too, was a dimension. Every subject-matter known to us fitted into all four dimensions. If you were able to ‘travel’ along any one of the first three dimensions, you should also be able to traverse the fourth.\n“When was all of this worked out?” asked Moti.\n“After many ages of contemplation and study. In the 20th century a brilliant physicist proved that, conceptually, it was on.”\n“But, practically, how can it be done? Do you know any time traveller?” asked Tiger sceptically.\n“Peter’le and I have just travelled into the past. But I don’t know how this was done,” said Archie.\n“Neither do I,” volunteered Theophil, appearing suddenly in front of us. “But I have shown you that it is possible. And the performance of an act proves its viability.”\n“Even if you can’t explain the cause or method?”\n“Precisely,” grinned Theophil. “If this were not so, how could you establish the very existence of Acts of God? And, coming to think of it, how could medieval thinkers believe in witchcraft?”\n“You have a point there,” I conceded when Tiger found no reply. “Well, thanks for the ride, Maestro.”\n“Always happy to please my friends,” he told us before he departed.\n2. Selecting the Nest Punchee Having settled these issues, it was time to pick the next punchee. We agreed that the candidate ought to be a representative of an Eastern culture. For a while we pondered Persia and India. Zoroaster {Zarathustra} and the Buddha {Siddhartha Gauatama} were, of course, great thinkers. Still, most of what is known about their philosophies and lives is shrouded in mystery.\nZoroaster (who presumably was active during the 10th century BC) was, basically, an Iranian poet and philosopher. His doctrine of good and evil, which was developed by Judaism and Christianity, went through numerous metamorphoses when related by his disciples. Buddha (273 – 232 BC) had given up his North Indian throne and became a mendicant teacher. We had no extant writings of either.\nThe two men’s traditions, passed to posterity by their disciples, may not have been authentic. In addition, both Persia and India were, from time to time, subject to Western influences. In contrast, China had remained a world of its own during its long history. So, in the end, we settled on it.\nThis took us to the next point. Who deserved a punch? The Yellow King was hard to identify or fathom. Kuan Yin may – or may not – have existed. In any event, was she human? Gods were of course out of bounds. After lengthy contemplations, I decided that only two men were eligible: Kông Füzî (K’ung-fu-tzu, dubbed Confucius by the Jesuits, 551 – 479 BC) and Qin Shi Huang (personal name – Yíng Zhèng; 260 – 210 BC). Both had lived during the long period of the Zhou Dynasty. The former was active during the era known as Spring and Autumn; the latter came to power during the succeeding Warring States period and founded the short lived Qin dynasty. Each had left a legacy to posterity.\n“Peter’le,” protested Archie, “you refer to a very long period. Confucius lived three hundred years before Qin Shi Huang. How can we consider them in one breath?”\n“Time was flowing at a slower rate at that time. And, of course, both of them lived well before the definitive Han period {202 BC – 220 AD}. Further, each cast his spell on all later periods of the Heavenly Kingdom. We can take them together.”\n“Peter’le is right,” approved Tiger. “The Old Testament covers a purportedly longer period. But didn’t King David and Jeremiah the Prophet follow one and the same lead?”\n“I agree with Tiger,” butted in Moti. “The human race has controlled the Earth for a very long period. But cruelty, stupidity and greed have been in command throughout. Technology and styles may have changed; but not human nature.”\nFor Moti, this was a long and definitive speech. To my relief Archie agreed. “Well spoken. As always, Moti makes sense. He is a persuasive fellow.”\nOur comparison of Confucius and Qin Shi Huang led to further arguments. Confucius was a thinker. He sought to teach his followers good mores, self-control and reserve. His concepts of ethics were based on ‘righteousness’ – on the notion that do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself. Yet, he had not initiated a faith. His dogmas continued to co-exist with the much older cult of ancestor worship and with Buddhism. His preaching related to appropriate day-to-day conduct.\nConfucius’ teachings – compiled in the Analects of Confucius – saw light long after his death. Did he write them? Indeed, even his involvement with the classical texts of China has been disproved by modern analysis. In the event, his philosophy – highlighting piety, sincerity and ancestor worship – stifled China’s cultural development for generations. It may have given his disciples a sense of dignity, but it deprived them of any imaginative initiative.\n3. Qin Shi Huang’s Achievements Qin Shi Huang was a very different man. He had wrenched control of the whole of China by conquering states larger than his original fief. He then started a new dynasty and ruled his ever-expanding empire with an iron fist. He adopted a philosophy or dogma known as Legalism (or, Positivism – meaning, the strict duty to observe laws), which conflicted with the far more moderate teachings of Confucius. Unlike Confucius, he had no belief in tolerance.\nQin Shi Huang’s main achievement was the unification of the warring states of China into a kingdom stretching from the yellow river right to the north of modern Vietnam. Throughout this vast empire, he introduced a uniform script (abolishing the earlier divergent writing symbols), a uniform currency and a common system of weights and measures. In addition, he dammed some rivers and constructed an elaborate system of roads. To ensure these were usable by all, he further prescribed the measure of the wheels of chariots and carriages. When he completed these projects, he reinforced and connected the defensive walls initiated by the states he had conquered. The very notion of a Great Wall, segregating China from northern nomads, gained momentum during his reign. All men of his kingdom were conscripted for this project. More men died in his building projects than in the wars waged by him.\nUnsurprisingly, Qin Shi Huang’s sway was resented by the population. In addition, he had invoked the wrath of the followers of Confucius. As his absolutism contrasted with their philosophy of moderation, he burned many of them alive and banished their writings. He became the subject of their tolerant hatred.\nShortly after Qin Shi Huang’s death, his dynasty was overthrown. Nevertheless, the innovations introduced by him ruled the Heavenly Kingdom from the vast grave he had erected for himself.\n“Qin Shi Huang was not a thinker,” argued Archie.\n“Perhaps not,” I conceded. “But he relied on the advice of Li Si (Li Shu): the greatest legalist thinker of the period. So, Qin Shi Huang knew where to look when he needed guidance. Confucius, insofar as he looked at all, faced the mirror! Further, Qin Shi Huang was a highly intelligent man. Confucius was an irresolute dreamer.”\n“So you have made your choice, Peter’le,” pronounced Moti.\n“I have rather. But, Moti, how did you know that I had made up my mind?”\n“I can read you. And this time I want to come with you.”\n“But your size Moti? A palace may tumble as you enter it.”\n“I’ll ask Lord Pan to shrink me.”\n“Then he might as well turn me into a gnome.”\n“And why not? A man’s size is best measured by his brains; not by his appearance or sex appeal,” interceded Tiger.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novels/nose-puncher/part-5/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"1-analysing-and-discussing-anachronism\"\u003e1.

She was no longer able to manage the stairs in the Pandan Valley and our spacious flat became hard to manage. We had to move to a flat in the Mandarin Gardens Condominium, on Singapore’s East Coast.\nA few years after her demise, I decided – at the suggestion of a close friend – to embark on a cruise of the Indonesian Islands. By then I had come to accept my having been ostracized by my late wife’s siblings. I was living comfortably in Mandarin Gardens and kept renovating it to fit my taste. Good friends helped me to find my way back to equilibrium. When I decided to take the cruise, I invited my God Daughter, Sophie, to join us.\nOne morning the cruise ship had to anchor off the coast. Access to the shore of Komodo Island was by engine driven boats which made the trip every fifteen minutes or so. Sophie and I left the ship at around 11.00 a.m. Some ten minutes later we disembarked at the pier. Just for once, my walking cane was of no use. Sophie had to help me out of the boat onto terra firma.\nAs we left the pier on our half day tour, one of the local attendants offered me his arm. To steady myself, I had to grasp it firmly. The twinkle in his eyes helped me to identify him as my lifelong friend.\n“Since when do you inhabit this island?” my mind asked Theophil.\n“You know very well why I decided to come over. You, Peter’le, are bound to need my help. Your health is poor and you are old and worn out. What made you take this tour?”\n“I want to see the Komodo Dragons, Maestro. I decided to take a chance.”\n“It’s free choice, Peter’le. I’ll make sure you don’t regret it.”\nThe trail appeared to me long and winding. Sophie and the attendant had to keep me going. In my heart of hearts, I cursed my impulsive decision to go ashore. Theophil read my mind. Still, he showed no sympathy. He remained a smiling, levelheaded tour guide.\nAfter some twenty minutes we got to the water hole. Four Dragons were now visible. They were massive: as big as average crocodiles. They did not move or open their eyes and appeared fast asleep. Indeed, they might have been part of the rock formation. All the same, some local trainers, armed with two-pronged wooden sticks, were keeping watch over them.\n“These wooden sticks are strange, Maestro. Why should an active full-size Dragon pay attention to them?”\n“Each Dragon tasted the prod of these sticks, especially around the eyes, before it grew to full size. Accordingly, the Komodos ‘respect’ the sticks. But they are useless when a Dragon attacks a prey.”\n“In that case, why do the trainers dare to display the Dragons?”\n“They feed them well and so the Dragons are usually not dangerous.”\nAt that moment Sophie drew my attention to one of the Dragons. It had opened its eyes and its two-pronged tongue was touching the ground. To me, it looked dangerous. The trainers, too, became apprehensive. One of them took hold of a rifle.\n“What is happening?” my mind asked Theophil.\n“This Dragon did not get a full share of the feed. It is hungry. But there is no real danger. It will not attack a crowd. A closely knit group appears to be too big. Hopefully, nobody will leave the group. The Komodos attack strays!”\nAt that very moment, Sophie drew my attention to one of our fellow tourists, a woman of about sixty years of age who wore clothes more befitting a girl in her mid thirties. Brandishing a digital camera in front of her, she broke away from the group and walked towards the Dragons, trying to capture them in the centre of her screen. Ignoring the attendant who asked her to remain with the group, she asserted that she had the right to take photographs. Looking at her closely, I recalled that, on the previous day, she displayed ill temper in a friendly Rubber Bridge session and had made sarcastic remarks to her partners.\nShe had by now set herself apart from the group and approached the Dragons. Suddenly, the hungry Dragon lurched and then leaped in her direction.\n“It’s charging!” Sophie let her apprehension show.\n“Isn’t it afraid of the trainers?” I asked aloud.\n“The fear of the stick is a conditioned reflex,” explained Theophil to my mind. “The Dragon is running amok. Its main reflex now is the urge to satisfy its hunger! And prey is within grasp!”\nJust before the Dragon threw itself on the photographer, it was hit by the bullet. It rolled over but, in its final struggle, managed to bite its prey’s thigh. Blood oozed from the wound as the frightened photographer steadied herself and used a handkerchief as bandage. After a few minutes she recovered from her shock and a strained smile descended on her face.\n“Are you hurt?” asked Sophie.\n“It’s just a scratch,” she replied composedly. “It’s nothing!”\n“She is kidding herself,” Theophil told my mind. “The Dragon’s bite is venomous. The poison will soon begin to act. Watch your photographer closely.”\nAll of us started to wind our way back to the pier. After ten minutes the photographer displayed fatigue. She looked unsteady.\n“Can I be of some help?” asked Sophie anxiously. “Shall we get you water?”\n“Oh, I’ll be alright,” she assured us but at the very same time started to sway and appeared out of control.\n“It’s the venom,” explained Theophil to my mind. “Usually, the venom does not act that fast but she has a poor constitution.\n“Please help her, Maestro. I know you can!”\n“Sorry, Pere’le: I am not an interventionist! And, you know, she worships Him and so it’s His business!”\n“Is she then a goner?”\n“Unless you pray to Him! Occasionally, He grants a supplicant’s plea.”\n“But how can I – one of your followers – address him? I am not a turncoat!”\n“You have my permission and I urge you to go ahead.”\n“Please Mighty God, please cure her!” I misquoted the scriptures.\nA light, windy cloud hovered for a few seconds. Then – right from its centre – emerged the figure of Michelangelo’s Creator. I had seen the Fresco in Rome and had noted that, at that time, the Lord’s beard had flaws.\n“When was your beard varnished to perfection, Oh Lord?” I assumed the courage to ask.\n“I got the artist out of his ward and made him do the job. Initially, he was stupefied by the pigments I created for the occasion but then came to terms with them. But what is this all about? Whom did you ask me to ‘cure’? Why should this friend of yours be brought back from the brink of death! Isn’t she happy with her past?”\n“I’m not sure, Good Lord,” I explained. “I turned to you because …”\n“I,” interjected Theophil, “told him she believed in You and hence needed to be attended by You rather than by me!”\n“Is she really a worthy person?” asked the Good Lord.\n“Well, she goes to Church every Sunday, says her blessing as often as possible and makes her donations to God’s Charity!”\n“True,” mused the Good Lord, “but she starves her maid and does not pay the poor servant’s salary regularly; she speculates in real estate in the Church’s name and fails to declare all her income to the authorities! Is she the type we want in heaven?”\n“What a strange reversal of roles,” I exclaimed out of control.\nBoth the Good Lord and Theophil looked at me with amazement. In the event, the latter asked me to explain.\n“Well, in the bible the Good Lord tells …\n“… Satan …” interjected Theophil\n“… that a fellow called Job is a fine man who avoids all things evil, whereupon\nSatan points out that Job may have ulterior motives. Presently, You – the Good Lord – find fault with the photographer and Satan seeks to promote the faith!”\n“But there has been a dramatic change of circumstance,” explained Theophil. “In Job’s era most people were good and worthy. Very few wanted to turn to me. My ward was getting empty! So, I wanted to extend hospitality to Job!”\n“And now?” I asked bewildered.\n“Now queues are forming in front of my gates! Many of the applicants are lawyers, bankers and software engineers. Worst of all, they bring with them sophisticated air-conditioning equipment. So, they don’t fear the heat! Me’think, they prefer it to the cold weather high above. And, of course, I allow them to play chess, bridge, poker and dominoes. They are also permitted to gamble (with electronic money), drink and behave in any way they like. For instance, women can be free with their favours and men – especially those who were overcome by shyness down on earth – are free to womanise etc. So, Peter’le, I try to turn applicants to Him! And your photographer has a ‘good core’! She belongs to His department!”\n“Oh, very well,” responded the Good Lord. “Let her have an extended term on this planet. We’ll judge her when her day comes!”\nWhen I regained my earthly vision, the photographer was recovering. Her face had regained some colour and she walked again steadily and with determination.\n“You look much better,” said Sophie.\n“And I feel fine. It is as if nothing had happened: a miracle.”\nBack on board, the photographer excused herself, left our group and rushed back to her cabin. Sophie helped me back to my own. When she left, I took my shower and then tried to relax. It had been a day of adventures.\n“Come and have a look at our photographer,” urged Theophil who decided to appear in front of me in full regalia.\n“Is she that interesting? I thought she was rather dumb!”\n“You and your negative outlook! Here have a look!”\nBack in her cabin, the photographer was wiping her eyes and kneeling devotedly.\n“Oh, Mighty God, I bless you for saving me. From now on I shall follow all your teachings. I shall give enough food to my maid, pay her all arrears and settle her salary punctually. And I shall give her every Sunday off: she too deserves rest. And – oh Lord - I am not going to speculate and I shall never scold people again! I’ll do my best to be worthy of this miracle!”\n“What a strange conversion,” I mused.\n“Indeed, Peter’le. A real conversion: a return to God with her whole heart. A conversion affected by Satan!”\n“So, on occasions, you turn yourself into a pastor, Theophil!”\n“And some say I am the epitome of evil!”\nA Painful Memory Some four years had elapsed since my cruise to the Indonesian Islands. I was no longer able to travel and spent as much time as possible at home.\nThat evening, the skies were clear and the view from my sitting room in Mandarin Gardens was as exciting as ever. But I was not calm. A painful memory kept disturbing my peace. Wishing to unburden myself, I waited impatiently for Theophil’s appearance. Before long he was seated by my side, assuming Peppi’s guise.\n“What’s the matter, Peter’le?”\n“A sad memory keeps plaguing me! I believe you know what is on my mind.”\n“I do; and I will indulge you. In truth, though, you should have visited the occasion involved when we covered the milestones in your life. Please tell me why you avoided revisiting it when we meandered through your life.”\n“Shame; and the feeling I ought not to talk about it to anybody!”\n“Yet it was a milestone. In the aftermath you lost the remnants of your regard for Pat. Well, let us time travel.”\nWe were back in New Zealand. A man in his forties, overweight, balding and dressed untidily, was walking along the shore in Lower Hut near Wellington. His wife was him. The man was downcast and silent. That very morning his mother advised him that his father had given up the ghost. She had asked her son to give the funeral a miss and, in any event, he felt unable to fly over. All the same, he felt shattered and dissatisfied.\nFor a while, the woman and the man kept their silence. Then, unexpectedly the wife had her say: “One Berger less. So what?”\n“You never recovered from this outburst,” stated Theophil. “You continued to walk in silence, Peter’le. I watched you from afar on that very occasion. Why didn’t you tell her off?”\n“To what end?” I asked bitterly.\n“So as to get it off your chest. Instead, you recalled in silence the many occasions in which you treated Pat’s mother with honour and helped Pat’s siblings when she asked you to step in! And, Peter’le, this silent resentment did you more harm than any outburst you have had in your life.”\n“Why was this incident crucial, Maestro? Was it really a milestone in my life?”\n“You alone know the answer! It is patent that the matter was never smoothed over in your mind. It kept gnawing at you. Months later, you discussed the incident with two of Pat’s siblings.\n“I recall their reactions. They tried to tell me Pat’s comment was acceptable. They pretended she wanted to soothe me. Nowadays, I can understand them. They felt that any member of their inner circle could do no wrong; and I was on the fringes. I was not one of them. It is of course possible that my reaction to their words had been too severe. But why do you think this was a milestone?”\n“What were your feelings for Pat up to that that very day?”\n“Sympathy and guilt: I knew I had not come up to her expectations and tried to be supportive whenever I could. Oh, . . . I see what you mean: as from that day I simply felt bound by the duties I undertook when I married her but my sympathy and the remnants of my affection were gone.”\n“That is the point, my dear Peter’le. Putting it bluntly: you no longer felt the duty to pretend to be a loving husband.”\n“True,” I conceded.\n“From that day onward, your priority became your hobbies and whims. Frequently, you were uncivil to Pat and to her siblings. They realised that you disliked them! No wonder they ostracized you after Pat’s demise.”\n“You make sense!”\n“That is not my only point, Peter’le. Your excuse for not flying over to attend your father’s funeral was Pat’s inability to remain on her own in Wellington. But did you really wish to attend the funeral? If Pat had been your real concern, you could have taken her with you or asked her sister to fly over to Wellington for a visit.”\n“I know: I simply wasn’t ready to bid my late father goodbye. In my mind he remained alive and kicking; I loved him.”\n“Pat’s bitter outburst was unfortunate,” Theophil explained. “But you faulted her for your own inadequacy: your unwillingness to face facts. Do you continue to think of your father?”\n“I ceased to do so after I met Peppi: he filled the void in my life.”\n“And after he died, I revealed myself to you, Peter’le. As from that day, you were able to turn to me.”\n“Was I then unjust to poor Pat?”\n“I cannot tell. Emotively, though, it was a turning point. Your grudge against Pat was anchored in the shouting match she had had with your father some two years earlier on. You tried to forget about this incident but it continued to irk you. It surfaced when she had her outburst.”\n“So that was a milestone in my life!?”\n“I believe it was: it was a turning point in your emotive make up.”\n“Why, then, did I fail to revisit it on our previous journey?”\n“You alone have the answer: Peter FitzOstrich.”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novels/theophil/part-4/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-komodo-dragons\"\u003eThe Komodo Dragons\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few years after my return from leave in Oxford, Pat succumbed to a fatal disease.

The verses that follow express Job’s viewpoint. He completes his discourse in this chapter by observing: “… the thunder of [H]is power who can understand?” [26:14]. The compiler then advises, at the very beginning of chapter 27: “And [Job] continued his discourse and said, ‘As God lives, who has taken away my right …” [27:1,2] and reaffirms his innocence.\nThen, in the last ten verses, namely 13-end, Job expresses the view taken by Job’s three friends. These words cannot be ascribed to Job the sufferer. The conclusion is that the first 12 verses of chapter 27 are rightly attributed to Job but that they should have been followed by a caption indicating that the remaining verses are part of Zofar’s final retort.1 Regrettably the opening words of Zofar’s last speech have not come down to us.\nIn support of this construction it is to be noted that it is in tandem with Job’s structure, which constitutes an exchange of the views held by Job with those of his three friends. To this end every speech of Job is followed by the response of one of his friends. Thus, Job expresses his views in chapters 3, 6-7, 9-10, 12-14, 16-17, 19, 21, 23-24 and 26-27:1-12. Elifaz delivers his three speeches in chapters 4-5, 15 and 22. Bildad speaks in chapters 8, 18 and 25.2 The only two chapters expressly attributed to Zofar are 11 and 20. The construction here proposed would give Zofar a third speech, namely 27:13-end and some sentences that have not come down to us. In this manner Job’s nine speeches are contested nine times by the retorts of his three friends.\nRegrettably, the Qumran Scroll does not shed light on this issue. Both chapters 26 and 27 are mutilated in it.3 The late Targum and the LXX follow the MT without significant variation.\nNumerous attempts have been made to draw a distinction between the speeches of the three friends. This is debatable. In reality there are only two basic theses in chapters 3 to 27 (inc.), namely: (i) Job’s viewpoint and (ii) the opposite concept manifested in the addresses of the three friends. Undoubtedly, there is progression in the words and metaphors used for the expression of the two views. Both Job and his three friends crystallize their opinions in the course of the debates. There are, nonetheless, only two basic philosophical approaches.\nA point frequently raised is that in the course of these lengthy debates, concluding at the end of chapter 27, ideas are repeated again and again. In a tome expressed in prose this would be a stylistically and methodically unforgivable blemish. The relevant chapters of Job are, however, poetic. Whilst the basic notions are repeated, the imagery and the metaphors differ.\nBy way of comparison take FitzGerald’s translation of Omar Khayyam’s Rubayats {quatrains}. The basic idea of enjoying life is repeated many times. Nonetheless, nobody would levy the redundancy complaint because each poem has it own thrust. Another illustration is presented by the Psalms. Many of them praise God. But are they redundant?\nIn a similar manner Job is not repetitive. The two opposed view points are developed and effectively crystallized. Further, the arguments are presented in poetry at its best.

I noticed the twinkle in his shrewd eyes when he handed me his meticulous notes respecting the drafts of the first two chapters of my thesis. His body language, too, indicated he thought my treatment was starry eyed.\n“Have I overlooked some important points?”\n“I don’t think so. Still, you deal with the façade. Bankers would love the clarity and be relieved that their record remains unscathed. Still, I suspect that, right from the start, the real background is often shoved into a corner.”\n“You are thinking of the Seddon case, aren’t you?”\n“I am. But, of course, it is only an illustration of what goes on generally. And I would like to know what you found out about that case. Actually, did you get to the bottom of it?”\nDennis Gray listened attentively to my narration of the facts. When I finished, he grinned at me. “Oh well, it was a fishy case, wasn’t it?”\n“Wasn’t it ever. But is it an isolated case or, rather, one of a norm?”\n“Rather common,” he responded unflinchingly.\n“But surely, exchange control measures are of recent origin.”\n“We had some during the First World War and, I suspect, even earlier than that. But exchange control involves only one instance leading to law evasion. Tax frauds, customs evasion, illegal dealings and other untoward transactions are not new. We have lived with them for ages.”\n“But surely, a respectable bank would not get involved. It would wash its hands of the affair when any illegality or shady dealings became apparent.”\n“But when do they become apparent?”\n“Tell me, Mr Gray: what do you think would be your own bank’s reaction to a case like Seddon’s?”\n”The same as Masterman’s, I suspect. As long as the customer is creditworthy, we do our best to carry out his instructions. We’ll have to wash our hands off an affair only when we know it involves an illegal angle.”\n“Do you then ignore mere suspicions?”\n“We have to: that is, if we want to remain in business.”\nDennis Gray’s observations made me ponder.

When I had completed my narration, she pointed out that the matter was within the jurisdiction of another department. She didn’t wish to cross wires with them. Still, she rang up her counterpart in that department.\nTo my pleasant surprise I recognised the incumbent. She had been one of my favourite students some twelve years earlier. At that time, she had been in her twenties; and she still looked the same.\n“I haven’t seen you in ages, Prof.”\n“Actually, I thought you were still with B \u0026amp; G. You were one of the three pupils they took on that year, Lynn.”\n“I was. Later on, they made me a Legal Assistant and after another few years promoted me.”\n“Why did you leave? Surely, the pay was good, wasn’t it?”\n“It was. But then, they made heavy demands on my time. Here I can usually leave at 5.30 or 6 o’clock. I can look after my two girls and spend some time with my husband.”\n“When did you get married?”\n“Shortly after I finished my law degree. And you know my husband!”\n“Eh?” I let my surprise show.\n“He works in the same department as you. His name is Paul.”\n“Good grief. We work quite a bit together. He is a fine young man!”\n“You mean ‘a young middle-aged man’, don’t you?”\n“To me all of you look so young. How old are your daughters?”\n“Four and six.”\nFor a moment I was perplexed; then saw the light. She had taken my course on Banking Law when I was in my early sixties. For me, too, time had not stood still. I had by now become an old man: one of the very few academics of my vintage who had remained fully employed after their 65th birthday.\nTo my regret, Lynn was unable to sort the case out. The issue was not purely legal – it concerned the fiscal policy of the Republic. On the one hand, we could not afford to invoke the wrath of the United States. They were too powerful and, in addition, one of our main markets. On the other hand, free trade and freedom of dealings in money were essential. If they were abrogated, our Republic might lose its hard-earned status.\n2. The Solution The only person who could give me a hint as to what was to be done was Lynn’s superior. Before I went over to his office, Lynn checked the details of the transaction. They were before him when I entered his posh office.\n“You don’t recognise me, Prof!” he chuckled.\n“Frankly, I don’t.”\n“I took your course in 1964.”\n“Are you by any chance R.?”\n“Guilty as charged. You gave me a B1!”\n“You did well. I remember your paper. But you know, you don’t look the same.”\n“Of course not. I am a grandfather – twice over.”\n“You must be close to retirement?”\n“They’ve extended me. I’ll stop by the end of next year: before I make a mistake.”\n“How will you occupy yourself?” I asked tactlessly.\n“I’ll be looking after my grandchildren,” he announced victoriously. “My grandmother looked after me. My late mother was a businesswoman.”\n“So, it is a sort of a cycle,” I mumbled.\n“It is, Prof. Always has been.”\nFor a while we gossiped. For my part, I felt as if somebody was walking over my grave. For a reason unknown to me, I had made very few attempts to contact former students. I was relieved when R. turned to the case. He had checked the source of the funds and advised me, in confidence, that the remitters had no record. In plain language, their name was not included in any “red signal” or “black” list.\nNeither R. nor any other officer of the Authority could take a clear stand. The regulations imposed the duty to disclose on the “bank”, provided it had “reasonable grounds” to suspect the source of the funds.\n“The word ‘bank’ is not clearly defined,” I pointed out.\n“It isn’t. In general, the word refers to the ‘officer in charge of the bank account’. The initial decision must be made by him.”\n“Generally, then, not by a member of another department, for instance a legal officer or a compliance officer?”\n“Not normally, unless the facts of a specific case raise his eyebrows.”\n“Thanks,” I said and added: “So if the bank officer in charge of the matters OK’s it, the ‘bank’ can go ahead?”\n“In strict confidence, this is the position.”\nBefore I left, R. suggested that my Bank consider the risk of the United States’ intervention. The American authorities had the power to seize our Bank’s balances in New York. I was aware that some local banks had burned their fingers and had needed the Authority’s tacit support to clear their name.\n“Off the record, our policy is simple, Prof. We have to avoid any clash with our American colleagues. All the same, we must protect our freedom of trade policy.”\n“I thought that was also the orientation of the United States?”\n“I believe, it is.”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/matter-of-compliance/part-5/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"1-my-contacts\"\u003e1.

One the senior professors came over to my room. Lawrence Gent was known as a fine courtroom advocate. He was as excellent when it came to legal points as when a case turned on the facts. At one stage, we appointed him dean but his commitments at court prevented him from running the faculty efficiently and so resigned. All of us treated him as the grand old man of the law school. His visits to the rooms of other colleagues were scarce.\nFor a while we looked out of the window and relished the view. Eventually, Lawrence broke the silence.\n“You do have a grand view, Peter. Best office in our faculty.”\n“You did me proud,” I smiled at him. “but did you really just want to enjoy the view from my window, Old Boy?”\n“That too; but I am delighted to drop in on my friends when time permits.”\n“You didn’t look too ready for a tête-à-tête when I spotted you in our library a few days ago.”\n“Well, I was writing an opinion and, alas, business takes priority overly friendly chats.”\n“Were you by any chance dealing with Robert McBride’s latest case and have come over to discuss this matter now. I believe you knew that he had discuss this matter with me.”\n“Spot on, except that – as I said before – I enjoy catching up with all friends whenever time permits.” After pausing for a moment, he added: “And as to the matter you just mentioned: not one of Robert’s successes, I fear.”\n“That’s putting it mildly. The fellow made an ass of himself.”\n“Aren’t you too blunt? Still, from what I hear our Robert was not at his best.”\n“Actually, what is your connection with the case, Lawrence?”\n“Initially, I turned down the brief offered to me by the sales house. I avoid taking up cases, when a good friend is on the other side.”\n“Commendable. Still, your reticence didn’t save Robert. Thomas Bardwell made mincemeat of both Jack Smith and our Robert.”\n“Thomas is a fine lawyer. Not the best when it comes to analysing authorities or awkward points of law. But the man has common sense and is a good fighter. And he knows when to pull his punches.”\n“He acquired his strategical skills from accomplished teachers!”\n“Oh well, he is a good student,” conceded Lawrence.\nBy then, the reason of Lawrence’s visit and discussion dawned on me. Jack Smith’s solicitors must have asked for his opinion about an appeal. Lawrence, who was watching me keenly, turned to this very matter.\n“Well, Peter, what do you think about an appeal?”\n“Not on,” I told him.\n“But how about the last minute points concerning Smith’s purported mistake?”\n“Jack sought damages, Lawrence. Effectively, he wants to keep the mare and get the price reduced.”\n“Do you think he can get this?”\n“Off the record?”\n“Of course.”\n“The judgment is sound. A last minute attempt to amend the pleading was uncalled for. I would leave matters alone. At best, the Court of Appeal may send the case back for a rehearing. But on the judge’s findings a claim for damages is bound to fail.”\n“I agree,” Lawrence was resolute.\n“When you fine tune your opinion, do try to play down Robert’s blunders.”\n“I shall. But I’m afraid the harm has been done. It will take Robert some time to live the cese down.”\nNeither of us had any more to say about the subject. For a few minutes we gossiped about Faculty affairs.

When the meal came to its end, an amused Rachel wanted to know what sort of food I took overseas. She grinned when I told her Chinese cuisine was tolerable but that the delight of boiled mutton kept eluding me during my two years at Oxford.\nShe was not surprised when I repeated my mother’s observation about the oddity of our instructions. She, too, sensed that Ruth might have acted without authority. All the same, it was best to stick to our instructions. The case was bound to turn on the legal issue. A searching cross-examination could be counter productive.\n“Why would Ruth take such a risk, Rachel? Issuing such instructions without her superiors’ consent could lead to an in-house scandal. Her very job may be on the line.”\n“But look, Eli: Ruth is pushing forty. And she is still on her own and has few friends. On many social occasions she looks forlorn: out of place. She would go a far way to please somebody who knows how to handle her. Chaps like Fischer pry on women of her type.”\nRachel’s words made me reflect. She herself was of about the same vintage as Ruth. Further, both were good looking and highly intelligent. All the same, they were worlds apart. Ruth was the pampered daughter of an upper-class German Jewish family. She was widely read, genuinely interested in music and art and a pleasant person to talk too. Rachel, in contrast, came from no-where, had no cultural aspirations and had to fight her way to the top. Her main asset was her worldliness. She understood people, knew how to get on with them and had an outgoing personality. One might admire her or hate her. But she was hard to ignore. Unlike Ruth, she was not prepared to blend with the scenery.\n“Ruth and I are very different persons, Eli. Life has taught me I have to pay for making mistakes. Ruth is afraid to make any. She has not realised that to be human you have, occasionally, to step out of line. She does not know that erring is a human trait. She is now paying for her diffidence.”\n“Did you ‘err’ when you took me on?” I asked compulsively.\n“I don’t think so. You, Eli, had to be taken out of your isolation. And, as you know, I was still recovering from the breakdown of my second marriage. I needed a shoulder to lean on. I brought our romance to its end, when I felt the time had come.”\n“I know. In any event, I shall always remain your friend.”\n“It goes both ways,” she told me. Then, abruptly, she turned back to our case. She knew I was still mystified by the facts. She too had noted the inconsistencies.\n“Is Fischer a fool, Rachel?”\n“A cunning devil is a more apt description.”\n“So why this silly pack of lies? Why does Fischer assert he arrived later than he did and what on earth was he doing on the 2nd story?”\nHaving nodded her head, Rachel concluded: “But Eli, why does all this matter us? Where is the benefit of exposing him? We have a good legal case. All you have to do is to convince the Judge that Fischer is an expert and knows all about scaffoldings. Ruth’s instructions do not proscribe this line of questioning or indeed the argument.”\n“But what made her take such a risk? What are they trying to hide?”\n“I’ve no idea, Eli. Perhaps it is best to leave well alone.”\nRachel’s approach made sense. As often before, her strategy was superior to mine. She sensed that, in certain situations, it was best not to open Pandora’s box. As matters stood, Fischer’s case was weak. He was the expert asked to report on progress and standards. In the process, he had a fall where men less qualified than himself knew how to handle themselves. Suppose you instructed a technician to repair the brakes of your car. Could he complain when, in the process, he had an accident because, unexpectedly, the brakes failed altogether?\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/scaffolding/part-5/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eDuring the Friday lunch, I devoured the Mediterranean dishes as if I had been starving for days.

It took Boaz and me a brisk walk of some twenty minutes to get there. Keeping up with the speed of my army trained friend was an effort. On arrival, we had to climb up a steep external staircase leading to the office. I was relieved to drop into the comfortable armchair proffered by our host. A cup of tea made me feel better.\nMr. Franz Wolf turned out to be a heavy set man, in his late middle age. His grey hair, stump nose and short mustachio gave him an aura of distinction. Puffing away on his carved Meerschaum pipe, he described the accident. While he related the gruesome details, my eye fell on a rack of pipes complemented by a tray of tobacco pincers and a few pipe-stops. Most were plain gadgets made of metal, but one – shaped as a smiling Chinaman with his arms folded in front of his chest – caught my attention. It was less than two inches in size but its shining, polychrome, porcelain could not be mistaken. I was looking for an opportunity to ask about it when, to my shock, Herr Wolf picked it up and muttered he had better extinguish his pipe.\n“Not with this masterpiece,” I exclaimed, out of control.\nBoaz’s eyes opened wide. Herr Wolf, in contrast, broke into a smile. Placing the figurine back in the tray, he put his pipe out with a modern utensil.\n“Didn’t take you long to spot him!” he said with satisfaction.\n“He is magnificent. where did you get him?”\n“Nüremberg – 1928. Herta and I spent our honeymoon there. What do you make of him?”\n“Meissen between 1733 and 1740,” I asserted after I had examined the figurine. “What a treasure Herr Wolf! He is perfect!”\n“Why are you so certain about the dates?”\n“Before 1733 they wouldn’t have cast him like this: he’d be heavier. Also, the hands and the face: miniatures like this were not produced before then.”\n“Why are you sure he was fired before 1740?” persisted Herr Wolf.\n“After that date, the porcelain was whiter and the decoration was even better.”\n“Won’t you let an uninitiated Sabre like me into the secret?” complained Boaz.\n“Herr Berger knows his Meissen. Connoisseurs study details.”\n“True,” conceded Boaz. “I used to collect Russian stamps. Now practice leaves me no time.”\n“But life without a hobby is like dinner without wine,” muttered Wolf. “And you, Herr Berger, how did you discover porcelain?”\n“My mother collects: mainly Vienna. Most of her pieces were smashed by the Brown Shirts: I watched them. But she managed to save a few and took them with her when we escaped. And did you get your entire collection out?”\n“I used some pieces to bribe my way out of Dachau. ‘Harley’ was kept by Herta.”\nBoaz, who had regained his composure, smiled indulgently. He realised the ensuing empathy between Wolf and me would advance the formation of the front needed to safeguard his client’s interest. Seeking to save time, he turned us back to the case.\nI listened attentively as Franz Wolf described his correspondence with the manufacturers. Right from the start, they had invoked the clause in the Contract of Supply and Purchase excluding their liability for consequential loss. To placate their conscience, they offered to inspect the guillotine and, if necessary, change the wiring. But they insisted that the accident took place because the main switch had been left on.\nAn action against them was unlikely to succeed: German law was tipped against Dahlia’s claim. Herr Wolf was able to discuss the subject intelligently. Before opting for a career in printing, he had studied law in Heidelberg and obtained a practising certificate. His decision to switch careers was made after two unhappy years as an attorney. But although he did not return to the Law, his recollection of the legal principles remained clear. To reinforce his own conclusion, he had solicited a second opinion from a former classmate, who was still practising in Cologne. He, too, was pessimistic.\n“Doesn’t Western Germany have consumer protection laws?” I asked.\n“Of course they have. But Dahlia handled the machine as an employee of our firm. Accordingly, consumer protection laws do not apply.”\n“How about a direct suit by herself against the manufacturers – based on a duty of care?”\n“Unfortunately, the clauses in the Contract of Supply and Purchase will defeat such an action. The clauses can be invoked against the purchaser’s employees.”\n“Can’t we shame the manufacturers into admitting liability? Surely, the publicity won’t do them any good!”\n“If the accident had taken place in Germany, this could work. The German Press would not take kindly to a technical defence where a young woman lost her hands. But Tel Aviv is far away. And the manufacturers have no local market.”\n“How many clients would they have in Israel?” I asked.\n“Probably, just us. I ordered their guillotine because we dealt with them in Leipzig.”\n“So, an action against them is out,” I concluded.\n“I am afraid so,” agreed Boaz. “Our only hope is to twist Rotem’s arm!”\n“So, the facts respecting the insurance policy are crucial,” I observed.\n“Precisely,” agreed Boaz. “You better cover the ground, Mr. Wolf.”\nThe circumstances, it soon appeared, were typical. Since its very foundation some fifteen years before the accident, the firm’s third-party and accident policy had been maintained with Rotem. Some four weeks before the annual expiry date Rotem sent a renewal slip, the duplicate of which was returned with a cheque for the premium. Unfortunately, when the last renewal slip had been sent, Rotem’s clerical staff overlooked a change of address notice they had received. In consequence, the envelope was dispatched to the firm’s old address and the new occupants had failed to forward it.\n“But didn’t you realise the policy was about to expire?” I asked.\n“Well, the office was run by Herta. If she had still been around, she would have notices. She ran the office meticulously. I’m sure she had a reminder in her diary.”\nAdroitly Boaz took over and explained that Herr Wolf had suffered his own tragedy. A few months before the accident, the couple’s only son, Uri, had been killed in a skirmish between his unit in the army and a group of saboteurs. Franz Wolf managed to carry on, but Herta was not up to it. She had a break down followed by a spell in a ‘sanatorium’. Shortly after her release she took an overdose of sleeping pills.\n“Running both the office and the firm was too much for me,” confided Franz Wolf. “We were looking for an administrator when the accident took place.”\n“But didn’t Rotem send a second reminder. They must have known the operations were in this house.”\n“They knew because – once in every few years – they inspected the building for our house-owner policy. But they did not send a second reminder. If they had, I would have sent a cheque instantly. Actually, at about the same time, they sent me a renewal notice for our personal householder policy. It went to our home address and the cheque went out the next day.”\nFranz Wolf’s explanation required consideration. My eye fell on ‘Harley’. His benign expression and soothing ambience were balsam to my agitated nerves. For a few minutes I meditated on the facts and on the ensuing problem. At the end of the spell, I spotted a glimmer of light: an unformed argument to be developed in the seclusion of my office. All I could hope for at this stage was to clarify a few, as yet veiled, points.\n“The firm’s policy, you say, was renewed regularly for at least ten years?”\n“Fifteen, I think.”\n“Did you at any time consider a change of insurers? Surely, some company might have offered more favourable terms: a lower premium or a reduction of the excess?”\n“Coming to think of it,” he responded readily, “we were approached by a French company. They offered us better all-round terms. I mentioned this to Rotem and they gave me a lecture. Israeli firms had to support each other and, they insisted, our long-term relationship was of a lasting nature. This, they said, had stopped them from raising the premium after a year in which we had several accidents.”\n“What did you do?”\n“We stuck to them.” Having halted for a few seconds, he added: “In many Continental systems this would lead to the formation of a binding renewal arrangement!”\n“Not in our English based system, I fear,” observed Boaz.\n“Let me think this over. In our system the point is perhaps debatable,” I told him.\nTo complete his task, Franz Wolf took us for a tour of the factory. Despite its ramshackle premises, the firm appeared well equipped. Modern instruments were in abundance. The accident-prone guillotine, which was no longer in operation, had been disconnected from the network and moved to a remote spot, like a naughty school boy told to ‘stand in the corner’.\nWhen we took our leave, after completing the tour, Franz Wolf asked: “Did Harley sort of talk to you, Herr Berger?”\n“He did rather and on legal points. I can’t explain it.”\n“I, too, hear him from to time. I don’t understand how this happens. An inanimate object can’t talk or inspire.”\n“Perhaps something inherent in Harley’s makeup triggers an internal channel of communications?”\n“Perhaps. Or does he stimulate our thoughts by assisting us to concentrate?”\n“My stamps did this to me,” volunteered Boaz. “When I got immersed in my album, the rest of the world ceased to exist and some of the heroes portrayed in Russian stamps appeared in front of my eyes.”\nFranz Wolf and I grinned. When Boaz and I took our leave, the alliance was in place. My next task was to communicate the information I had gleaned to Jacob Keren and Rachel Zeitlin.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ravages-of-a-guillotine/part-5/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eFranz Wolf’s firm occupied  a pre-War ramshackle three story house in Peenes Street in the industrial part of Tel Aviv (adjacent to Jaffa). It took Boaz and me a brisk walk of some twenty minutes to get there. Keeping up with the speed of my army trained friend was an effort. On arrival, we had to climb up a steep external staircase leading to the office. I was relieved to drop into the comfortable armchair proffered by our host. A cup of tea made me feel better.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Part 5: Franz Wolf"},{"content":"As we walked out, Boaz heaved a sigh of relief. “Ehood Morag gives me a headache. He has a knack of complicating simple points!”\n“Don’t you think his analysis of our case is right? Isn’t Morag brilliant?”\n“He is; but only in a narrow field,” conceded Boaz. “But he is unbending and makes no allowances once he steers a course. Judges like him forget they deal with human problems: not with philosophical arguments!”\n“I don’t think he is narrow,” I muttered.\n“The way you step up to his defence after doing your best to put him down! You do admire him, don’t you?”\n“I suppose I do.”\n“How about his rotten performance in his commercial law course. You showed him up there!”\n“It ain’t his field, Boaz!”\n“That’s what I am getting at. A man with his ability should have spent some time in the library and prepared a decent series of lectures. He is up to it!”\n“Of course he is. His commercial law course was disappointing. Perhaps he was too busy?”\n“No, Eli, he was too bloody arrogant. It’s the same in his other activities. Take his interest in philosophy: he has read every scrap of paper written by writers he likes. But he ‘can’t be bothered’ to read Kant. I’m told it’s the same in the dancing club. He sticks to Waltz and Tango, which he says are civilised. You won’t get him to try a Polka. Sheer arrogance and narrow mindedness!”\n“Oh well, we’ll have to agree to disagree,” I gave in, knowing in my heart of hearts that Boaz was a better judge of human nature than myself.\nSoon we reached the small lane leading to David Mizrachi’s eatery. “Are you free for lunch?” I asked Boaz. Noting the change in his expression, I added in haste: “It’s a treat – Keren gave a bonus to all of us.”\nBoaz and I relished the succulent Shashlik and Kebabs, the marinated eggplants and the Pitas dipped into the delicious Humus. As we kept indulging in small talk, I recalled our days at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Despite his shock of black hair, his broad shoulders and his tall figure, Boaz was too heavy set to be considered good looking. All the same, women were fascinated by the twinkle in his eye, by his easy going manner, by his confident airs and by his carefree demeanour. Many of us felt envy as he appeared, on many an evening, walking down fashionable King George Street with his arm around one attractive girl or another. All of them, though, turned out to be temporary companions. Boaz had his fun, showed his appreciation but preserved his freedom and independence.\nAfter he graduated, Boaz Tamir left Jerusalem and joined Israel Silver’s renowned law firm in Tel Aviv. One morning, I received an invitation to his wedding. The lucky girl was Miriam Dagan, a relief teacher who spent a term in a left-wing secondary school in Tel Aviv on secondment from Kibbutz Yokneam.\nWhen I saw her, I opened my eyes wide. The bride was not the type of easy going, light hearted, glamour girl we used to associate with the lady’s killer of Jerusalem. She struck me as a caring, self assured, dependable and warm hearted woman, whose beauty lay in her character and outlook on life. Her plain looks did not detract from the impact left by her personality and by her warm, dark brown, eyes.\n“So you are Eli,” she said when I called on them a few weeks after their wedding. “Boaz never stops talking about your days in Jerusalem.”\n“Hopefully he told you only good things, Miriam,” I said lamely.\n“Please, call me Miri – all my friends do. And I’m sure there are only good things to tell,” she answered with a smile that transformed her face.\n“I hope I’ll live up to your expectations,” I said, starting to feel at home.\nMiri had prepared an excellent meal. In response to my compliments she revealed how she had picked the art up from her mother. Long before the family migrated to Palestine, Mrs. Dagan (Kornfeld in those days) had run a table d\u0026rsquo;hote in Prague. It was only natural that she was put in charge of her Kibbutz’s communal kitchen and dining room, with a small staff under her command. Over the years, she passed her culinary skills on to her eager daughter, teaching her also how to put any available foodstuffs to their best use. The meal we enjoyed that evening proved that Miri had been a good pupil. The stuffed cabbage rolls, served with a tangy tomato sauce, the mixed vegetables and the potatoes with parsley were delicious. Unable to resist, I accepted two extra helpings. Miri’s eyes danced with merriment.\nThen, to my dismay, I felt the first wheeze and the asthmatic’s dreaded sense of choking. Trying awkwardly to conceal my inhaler in my palm, I took two puffs and, to my relief, found that the tight discomfort in my chest was abating.\n“How long have you suffered from it?” asked Miri. Boaz, who knew I was reticent on the subject, looked at me with unease. Miri’s directness, though, had disarmed me.\n“Since I was a boy of 4 or 5, Miri. It started after a bout of pneumonia I got when we were refugees in France.”\n“I had asthma when I was a child,” she volunteered. “I grew out of it in my teens. And you, Eli, should not take things that can bring it on, like sweet wine. There’s nothing to be embarrassed about: you can be sure people understand.” Discreet Boaz looked at her reproachfully. I, though, was not offended: Miri had spoken sincerely and her words made sense. Smiling at both of them, I thought to myself that Fortuna had been at her gracious best when she brought Boaz and Miri together.\nDuring the next two years I spent many a happy evening in their comfortable flat in North Tel Aviv, with its pleasant glimpses of the Yarkon river. Boaz was rising fast in Israel Silver’s office and Miri coped well with her two careers: the meticulous housewife and the model schoolteacher. To the regret of all their friends, the atmosphere of solid well being changed thereafter. Miri, who was a few years older than Boaz and who was concerned about her maternal age, decided to start a family. For a while Boaz resisted: he was blissfully happy with her and satisfied with his career. He craved for no permutation. In the end, though, he gave way.\nMiri had a difficult pregnancy. The worried look that often crept over Boaz’s face was a source of concern to all his friends. Fortunately, he did not allow his personal problems to affect his work. On occasions, though, he appeared close to breaking point. As time went on, calling on them became an ordeal. Miri continued to shower her hospitality when a guest turned up. To our dismay, she often rushed down the three flights of stairs leading to their flat to get some sweetmeats or soft drinks from the grocer on the corner. Like other friends, I concluded it was best to keep away for a while.\nMatters took a turn for the better when little Ruthi arrived. Leaving the dining room at the Kibbutz in charge of her second in command, Miri’s mother came down to Tel Aviv to help her daughter out. Miri recovered in no time and was again able to welcome guests with the ease of earlier days. Once again, many of us flocked to their home. This happy state was not disrupted by Miri’s second pregnancy which went well. Unfortunately, she took things too lightly, carrying on her full-time job until, one sad morning, she had to be rushed to hospital. To everyone’s relief, the episode ended without a tragedy: Miri recovered after a few weeks. But baby Benjamin, who had arrived prematurely, remained undersize and sickly. After a number of heavy head and chest cold, he had his first attack of asthma. Despite the favourable diagnosis of two paediatricians and the care lavished on him by his parents, he was unable to shake it off.\nBenjamin\u0026rsquo;s condition led to a turning point in the Tamir’s fortunes. Determined to nurse her son back to health, Miri resigned her job and, before long, the loss of her salary triggered financial problems. Eventually, their house loan fell into arrears. Although the bank agreed to reinstate it and to extend the repayment period, the interest rate applied to the new package was considerably higher than that charged originally. In consequence, the reduction of the monthly instalments was smaller than the Tamirs had anticipated. Occasionally, Miri was able to help keep their heads above water by giving private tuition. But more often than not, they were short of cash.\nThoughts of the problems faced by the Tamirs kept roving through my mind during the sumptuous repast in David Mizrachi’s eatery. I was, further, reflecting on the strong friendship that bound me to the Tamirs on the individual level but, at the very same time, did not stop me from resorting to every legitimate trick when Boaz and I were pitched against one another professionally. I knew that Jacob Keren had a similar relationship with his two arch rivals. To function properly within the rules: all of us had to drive a wedge between the personal and the professional worlds in which we existed. Those who lost sight, or who confused the issues, usually came to grief.\n“A penny for your thoughts, Eli,” I heard Boaz chuckle.\n“Our life philosophy: the lawyer’s need to separate the personal from the professional. Is it wholesome?”\n“You mean: is it sensible?”\n“I had rather ask: isn’t it perverse?”\n“I don’t think it is,” said Boaz after a reflective pause. “When you handle a case, or negotiate a deal, you act for your client: you look after his interests. You can’t allow your friendship for the other party or his representative to interfere. But once that matter is settled, we function as individuals. The client’s dealings must not be allowed to affect us on that plane.”\n“I suppose you are right. But sometimes the boundaries get obliterated!”\n“Quite,” agreed Boaz dryly. “Like when you use someone else’s style and standard letters as a camouflage!”\n“You think that’s going too far?” I asked, mortified.\n“Borderline,” Boaz comforted me. “But pinching your friend’s notes just before he gets up for his opening is a different matter altogether!”\n“I can’t imagine any one of us stooping that low!”\n“I am told it has happened.”\nFor a while we gossiped about old friends and new acquaintances. Then, at long last, I assumed the courage to ask about Miri and Benjamin.\n“Miri\u0026rsquo;s O.K., Eli. But Benji is no better. Sometimes I wish Miri didn’t drag him from one doctor to another. The bills accumulate but the medicines do him no good – no good at all.”\n“You ought to put a stop to it, Boaz. I’ve been through it when I was a boy. Usually, these specialists are just a bunch of sharks – sharks and quacks!”\n“Why don’t you tell Miri when you come over next? And, coming to think of it, we haven’t seen you for some time.”\n“I’ve been shuttling between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Some legal points turn on the Turkish Land Law. Some materials are available only in Jerusalem.”\nAs we were getting ready to leave, Boaz reverted to the Omri Tal matter. “Eli, we should really spend some time on the liability issue. Is fifty -fifty agreeable?”\n“I’m pretty sure it is. I’ll have to check with Hannah; but I see no problem. Off the record, it’s the very figure she had in mind.”\n“Shall I drop you a line to this effect?” asked Boaz.\n“Please do. I’m quite certain we won’t haggle on this point. The actual sum is something different!”\n“Very well,” said Boaz, taking hold of his briefcase.\n“But before we go, Boaz, thanks for saving the situation in Morag’s chambers.”\n“Don’t mention it, Eli. And you must not let Jacob Keren put you up to such ruses. It’s one thing to parry with a chap like Morag. I suspect he enjoys it if he gives as good as he takes. Tricking him into an outburst with a view to getting him off a case is a different matter altogether: he would have never forgiven you.”\n“Did he know what I was up to?”\n“Hard to tell. If he was, he also knew Keren was behind it. In any event, you handled him well later on. So the episode is closed. But don’t you ever again let Keren use you as a pawn! I suppose he’d express regrets if you came to grief. But he won’t lift a finger to help! A chap like him never does!”\n“Are they all like that, Boaz?”\n“Some may be smoother – less obvious. But they are of the same mould. It’s a harsh world, Eli!”\n“Are we, too, going to end up like them?” I asked after a pause.\n“I fear we may. It’s the price of success at our game. All leading lawyer have worked their ways up through the ranks. They had their own ideals as young men and, even today, observe legal ethics and the norms of honesty and good behaviour. We must concede that they are honourable and righteous men! Still, they have taught themselves to play hard and fast within the accepted parameters. As long as they ‘act lawfully’, they are not pricked by conscience or bothered by any consideration for others!”\n“And we too may end up like them,” I said sadly. “After all, even now we enjoy the games we play in court and out of it.”\n“Quite. And see you soon in our place. Ruthi has been clamouring for her Uncle Eli. But please don’t bring her chocolates. She breaks into a rash the next morning!”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/the-luck-of-valentino/part-5/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAs  we  walked out, Boaz heaved a sigh of relief. “Ehood Morag gives  me  a  headache.

Sale of the Munich Business Peppi decorated his new flat to his own taste. The Albigensian panel painting, which prior to Helga’s death had been kept out of sight, now adorned the wall of his study.\nShortly after moving into his new flat, Peppi received two letters. Anna wrote to say she had completed her secretarial studies and had accepted a well-paid post in one of Bremen’s leading industrial firms. She thanked him for his support in the past but emphasised that she was relieved to be able, at long last, to ‘stand on her own two feet’. Peppi’s reply, congratulating her on her achievement, was laconic.\nThe other letter, from Lucy, was short and to the point. She wanted to know why Peppi had not joined her in London and urged him to make the move as soon as possible. She concluded it with clear language: ‘I simply hate the idea of your being all alone in Munich with nothing but the business and your memories.’\nThis second letter was music to Peppi’s ears. In his reply, he explained that he had to remain in Munich for a while in order to dispose of the old business. He realised that the maintenance of two shops was no longer advisable.\nSome three months later Peppi mentioned his interest in selling the business to Herr Schneider, who had initially joined him as an apprentice shortly after Herr Schultz’s retirement. Settlement by payment of an annuity being unacceptable to Peppi, Schneider began to look around for a suitable financial package. As was to be expected, Herr Schneider, who had no financial experience or acumen, took his time. Peppi shrugged his shoulders and waited.\n2. Anna’s Wedding and Lucy’s Doctorate One evening, when Peppi returned home after work, he was surprised to find a letter from Anna. She had not written since her graduation and, truth be told, Peppi was not disturbed by her silence. He glanced over the letter as he unpacked his sandwiches, and came to an abrupt halt. Anna wrote that she had married Otto Schwartz. They had had ‘a discreet ceremony followed by an intimate reception’, to which they invited only a few close friends, most of them protestant clergymen and their wives, and Otto’s widowed mother. Anna explained that, as it was a ‘solemn religious occasion’, she thought Peppi would not be comfortable. An epitaph, added to make amends, read: ‘I very much hope you will find the time to visit us soon. Otto would love to meet you.’\nPeppi was stunned. His sandwiches tasted like rubber and the nip of Slivovitz had no zest. For a few seconds, he looked thoughtfully at ‘Adam and Eve’, which concealed the safe housing his special bottle. His instant problem, though, was the pain in his heart: not an issue to be discussed with Theophil. After a while, Peppi rose to his feet and began to pace the room. When he had made up his mind he grabbed the telephone.\n“You alright, Papa?” asked Lucy as soon as he announced himself.\n“As well as can be expected! Lucy – were you invited to Anna’s wedding?”\n“Don’t you think this is something to discuss with her, Papa? I don’t want to come between the two of you.”\n“You won’t; I promise. Just tell me the truth.”\n“Yes, she invited me. But I didn’t go.”\n“Because she told you I wasn’t asked?”\n“That was one of the reasons, Papa; and I told her so. I wrote back and said: ‘It’s up to you whom you invite; but I am not coming’.”\n“You mentioned another reason for not going over. What was it?”\n“I wanted it to be a surprise; but I might as well tell you now.”\n“Well?”\n“My viva had been fixed for the very day after Anna’s wedding!”\n“Your viva?”\n“Yes, Papa: my viva voce – the oral examination of my doctoral thesis. I have been reading for a PhD in Cambridge for the last two and half years.”\n“Why didn’t you tell me?”\n“I wanted it to be a surprise.”\n“But now it’s finished: and you’ve got it!”\n“Well, I had a pleasant viva. I’m optimistic; and so is my supervisor! But you cannot really tell until the examiners have submitted their report.”\nPeppi rejoiced at the good news. His anger over his rejection by Anna gave way to a solid feeling of satisfaction and pride. The ensuing euphoria dispersed the cloud of darkness that had engulfed him.\n“What were you researching, Lucy?”\n“The thesis deals with illuminated books of the Anglo-Saxon period.”\n“Then you are bound to pass,” Peppi announced. “You know more about them than any other person in the field!”\n“Except my supervisor and the examiners! Papa, this is why I didn’t want to tell you. I have come up with a new theory. One of the examiners is an arch conservative, and I’m departing from her views.”\n“With good arguments and backed by proof, I’m sure!”\n“So I believe; but I wasn’t going to tell you until I had the piece of paper in my hand.”\n“I’m sure it’ll be alright. Do you know what this means to me?”\n“The first Doctor Stölzenfeld in the family?”\n“That’s the main point, of course. But there is another point, Lucy. I have had plenty of luck throughout my life; and I needed it! True, I worked my guts out. I never gave myself a rest. All the same, fortune was on my side! Yours is a solid achievement – your own work; your own creation. This is splendid news. If they don’t pass you, we’ll publish your work without their blessing!”\n“Thanks; but, Papa, I too had a lucky break.”\n“Luck – how come?”\n“From the start, I was certain that my type of illuminated book originated in Ireland. But my conclusions were based on circumstantial evidence. I couldn’t lay my hands on a single manuscript to prove my point. The Vikings and Normans destroyed everything. The only hope was for a find across the Channel. Others tried and came up with a blank. So did I, initially.”\n“Well?”\n“On the final day of a break I took some time ago, I had a last browse in an antiquarian bookshop in Toulouse. I was about to walk out empty handed when I bumped into an old man emerging from another aisle. He fell over and, as I helped him to get up, I saw a book that had dropped from a shelf housing collections of old sermons. I was about to put it back when I saw that it was what I had been looking for. It must have been on that wrong shelf for years!”\n“What a strange coincidence,” said Peppi trying hard to hide his excitement. “Lucy, what did this old fellow look like?”\n“He was almost as tall as you, Papa; and he wore old fashioned clothes. Still, what struck me most was the way he looked at me. It was a friendly look; but his glance went through me – as if he could see right into my soul.”\n“Did you speak to him?”\n“I insisted on treating him to a coffee. He was reluctant but in the end agreed. He looked old, Papa, but not at all frail.”\n“Did he tell you his name?”\n“He is Professor Dr L.M. Theophilius, a philosopher from Heidelberg. Judging by his accent, he is a German from the North.”\n“What else did he tell you?”\n“When I told him about my thesis, he said I might find some books in a village near Dublin. He said he had discovered some interesting unknown manuscripts there in his own field.”\n“His own field?”\n“Theology. He averred that more rubbish had been written on this subject than on any other.”\n“And you found some further manuscripts in the place he recommended?”\n“I did indeed!” said Lucy.\n“Did he give you his card?”\n“No. But he suggested I look him up in his Faculty if I happened to come over to Heidelberg. But Papa, why are you so interested in him?”\n“Idle curiosity,” replied Peppi nonchalantly. His heart, though, was beating fast. Was it possible that Theophil had decided to assist Lucy? But why had he chosen to reveal himself to her? Why did he not just nudge her?\n“What a scream you are, Papa,” Lucy broke the ensuing silence. “Just a few minutes ago you were mad. And now you are asking a lot of friendly questions about a total stranger! Still, I am glad the storm is over.”\n“It is, rather. There is an old saying, which I think your Dr L.M. Theophilius is familiar with: you win some, you lose some. Your success, is also my victory. So to hell with Anna’s petty mindedness.”\n“I haven’t got my degree yet, Papa!”\n“You will,” said Peppi.\n“Let’s hope so. But now tell me – you are no longer furious with Anna, correct?”\n“I’ll put it down to experience. But I’m not travelling to Bremen. If Anna wants to see me, she and her Otto can take the train to Munich.”\n“Fair enough. And, Papa, it’s high time you came over to London. Mother would not have wanted you to remain all alone in Munich, living on hot dogs, hamburgers and sandwiches; and drinking more Slivovitz than is good for you!”\n“Now, now, Doctor Lucy – don’t you dare criticise your old father. But alright: I’ll make the move within three months.”\n3. Theophil Explains Peppi cleared the table and washed the dishes. He then slid into his comfortable chair, took his special bottle and raised it to his lips. As always, the drink had a sedative effect followed by a sensation of inner peace.\n“And how are you, Theophil?” he asked as soon as he felt the other’s presence. “Or should I say: Herr Professor Dr L.M. Theophilius?”\n“Now, now, Joseph-Dieter Freiherr von Stölzenfeld,” chuckled the voice in his head. “As the British say: ‘Sarcasm is the lowest form of wit!’ You agree, don’t you?”\n“You have a point there. And please accept my thanks. It was good of you to help her.”\n“Your daughter is a nice and outspoken lady! I like the way she dubbed you a ‘scream’.”\n“But don’t you think mine was a natural reaction?”\n“It depends, Peppi. What you experienced was a sudden transition from hot fury to sheer bliss, or as the Rabbis of old used to say: ‘From abysmal depth to a high plateau’. Would you, my dear Peppi, call this ‘natural’?”\n“Put yourself in my position, Theophil – wouldn’t you have reacted in the same way?”\n“But, my boy, I have no hot emotions, no sexual drive and, of course, no family affiliation. How can I possibly put myself in your place? Still, I suspect you wanted my advice about moving to London. Actually, it may be a good idea: take Lucy’s advice!”\n“I must first dispose of the business here.”\n“You’ll do that sooner than expected!”\n“May I ask you just one question, Theophil?”\n“You want to know why I approve of Lucy although she is a devout Christian?”\n“Well, yes.”\n“To discard all believers would be just as irrational as to grant my support to every ‘sinner’. Shall we say that I approve of Lucy’s personality. She is, as I have said, a nice lady.”\n“Thanks, Theophil.”\n“Don’t mention it. But now, Peppi, it is my turn to be curious. How do you propose to reply to Anna?”\n“I’ll send her a cheque – as a wedding gift. But I’ll tell her that I shan’t be travelling up to Bremen.”\n“Why not add that they are welcome to visit you here or, later on, in London?”\n“Good idea. Thanks for the suggestion!”\n“Always glad to assist my friends.”\nTheophil’s prediction concerning the business came true sooner than Peppi had expected. A few days later, the owner of an antiques shop in Hamburg offered to acquire Schultz \u0026amp; Stölzenfeld, taking Schneider on as Junior Partner.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-devil-in-munich/chapter-5/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"1-sale-of-the-munich-business\"\u003e1.

A Budding Actor In most regards, my success at the trial remained a Pyhrric victory. In the minds of the public, a worn cliché – “there is no smoke without fire” – defeated the logical argument. Josephus’ reputation remained as tarnished as ever. All the same, the historical trial of the long deceased historian constituted a milestone in my career. Recalling it vividly during the dinner in Pension Kegel, some 45 years after the event, I concluded that the prelude to the great football match remained my neatest achievement as a lawyer. Single handed, I had won a battle that took place in an unsympathetic, even prejudiced, forum. Relaxing in Pension Kegel’s comfortable sitting room as I sipped a cup of aromatic coffee, I mused on the episode and on the major effect it introduced into my erstwhile lonesome existence: it cemented a bond between Pilkin and myself.\nFor before long, Pilkin became a regular guest in our flat in Melchett Street. Occasionally, he spent the mid-day break at my place and quite often came over in the evening for a game of chess, of dominoes or for a reading session. After a while, he confided that he had difficulties in memorising the ‘lines’ for his parts, especially when they came from older plays imbued with archaisms. Keen to assist, I started to rehearse with him. In the process, I noticed that Pilkin’s deportment was imperfect. Fortunately, Shosh took the same view. Within a few months, we helped him to smooth his rough edges out. But our tutoring had no bearing on Pilkin’s day to day life! Off-stage, he remained ‘the little elephant’.\nDuring the long vacation following our second year in TA.1, Pilkin became an active amateur actor. He played the mayor in Gogol’s Country Inspector and the Malade Imaginaire and Volpone in Moliere’s plays. To the delight of his two most ardent admirers – Shosh and myself – he also excelled as Sir John Falstaff. But his ace accomplishment was the title role in Tavyeh the Milkman.\nThe performance of Shalom Aleichem’s classic in the secondary schools of our era had become as mandatory as the staging of Shakespeare in English public schools. Years before the play proved a box-office success in its musical version of Fiddler on the Roof, it had moved many hearts in Israel. Tavyeh’s courage, tenacity and versatility left their impact on Israeli audiences despite the hero’s absurd Yarmolka, his untidy Talith and his undignified attempts to fit into the hostile, uncouth, environment of the crumbling Russian empire.\nIn the play, Tavyeh’s traditional outlook is put to the test by his three daughters. He is scandalised but accepts his eldest daughter’s refusal to marry the wealthy widowed butcher to whom he had promised her hand. Grudgingly, Tavyeh gives his blessing to her betrothal to the poor Jewish tailor she loves. Tavyeh is dejected – even forlorn – when he accompanies his second daughter to the railway station, where she is to board the train to Siberia in the hope of rejoining her radical, exiled, Jewish fiancé. But Tavyeh’s philosophy fails him when his youngest daughter elopes with a Cossack. All attempts to mollify him fail until the entire Jewish community is expelled from the Stetl [village] in the course of a government organised pogrom. When Tavyeh spots that his third daughter and her husband are also leaving, he gives them his blessing.\nI have watched performances of both the play and the musical on stages in Europe, in America and in Asia. Some shows were excellent, others just good and the rest indifferent. Naturally, the settings of dedicated theatres were superior to the props put up by our school. But although many renowned ensembles boasted excellent actors, none came up with a Tavyeh equal to Pilkin. Once he entered the stage, Pilkin ceased to be ‘the little elephant’ and metamorphosed into Shalom Aleichem’s hero.\nDuring our last year in TA.1, Pilkin became a much sought after Tavyeh. He played the role in performances of other secondary schools, in shows put up by youth ensembles of our city theatres and on the invitation of political clubs. His success stood him in goods stead when he embarked on his two and a half years of military service. After the ordinary spell in the barracks, he was transferred to the pampered ‘entertainment corps’. He thrived and, in addition, incurred the envy of our lesser classmates, who had to slog their way through mundane and taxing army units.\n2. Becoming a Lawyer I alone had no cause for resentment. Due to my poor health and weak constitution the medical board turned me down. In consequence, I enrolled in the Faculty of Law in Jerusalem straight after my last year in TA.1. By the time Pilkin asked for a transfer to the Officers Training Corps, which opened the way to a career in the army, I had completed my second year of studies and, with my heart in my mouth, called on Jacob Keren.\nTo my delight, Keren engaged me straightaway as a ‘probationary cadet’. Thereafter I shuttled regularly between the Law School in Jerusalem and my tiny office at Jacob Keren \u0026amp; Associates in Rothschild Boulevard in Tel Aviv. In the process, I gradually developed from a starry eyed schoolboy into a young, down to earth, lawyer.\nPilkin and I met from time to time during these times of hope. On each occasion, he amused me with indiscreet tales about feats of the army and about his affairs with mysterious and only too willing girls. All in all, I was gratified by his general progress in the military and particularly by the praise lavished on his performances on the stage, such as his appearance as Schweik in the party given to celebrate the graduation of his group of trainee officers.\nAt the same time, I could not close my eyes to his limitations. Pilkin excelled only in dramatic parts imbued with a touch of irony or ridicule. He was lamentable as Mark Anthony in Julius Caesar, ruined Peer Gynt and failed miserably in his characterisation of Lennie in Steinbeck’s Of Mice and Men. Another cause for concern was his inability to come to terms with secondary parts. Pilkin felt the need to be in the centre. Even when out of the limelight he sought to focus attention on himself. Initially, Shosh and I tried to reason with him but, after a while, realised that our protestations fell on deaf ears.\nPilkin’s eccentricity led to many raised eyebrows when he returned to the army’s entertainment corps as a two stripped officer. To my dismay, Shosh confided she had heard talk about his imminent transfer to a less prestigious unit. Events, though, took an unexpected turn.\n3. Pilkin’s Heart Attack One morning, when I was trying to unravel a legal problem in a complex case, I was startled by the ominous bellowing of the telephone. Preparing myself for the onslaught of my impatient employer, I picked the receiver up with trepidation. To my surprise, it was Shosh.\n“Eli, haven’t you heard about Chayim?” Shosh aspired to rid our ancestors’ ancient tongue from alien implants. So she disowned nicknames, like ‘Bushi’, that ‘did not sound right’.\n“Did anything happen to him? Not a shot gun marriage, I hope?”\n“That’s not funny, Eli! And no – nothing like that. Chayim had a heart attack a few days ago!”\n“What?”\n“So you haven’t heard about it!”\n“I wouldn’t be here if I had,” I let my annoyance show.\n“Well, yes – I know. But of course one can never be sure. We haven’t seen much of you lately!”\n“How did it happen?”\n“They had a wild party: plenty to drink and I don’t know what else. And next morning they had to take him to hospital.”\n“Where is he?”\n“In Jerusalem, in Hadassah – he came up from Ramleh to see some chaps from the theatre!”\n“How did you find out?”\n“I’m spending a fortnight with Uzi’s family. One of Pilkin’s pals rang me.”\n“I’ll call you from the Jerusalem this evening. I’ll be there at about 6.30.”\nThe ward had a synthetic aroma of hygiene. Everything appeared tidy, neat and well managed. Pilkin, alas, looked haggard. His cheeks were sunk, his eyes lacklustre and his hair was unkempt and untidy. The lower part of his enormous, immobile, bulk rested on a large air ring placed above the mattress. Gone was the ‘little elephant’. Lying in front of me was a felled bull.\nAs I entered the ward, Pilkin’s gaze was fixed, dejectedly, on some invisible object on the ceiling. When, eventually, his glance shifted to me, he nodded and a ghost of a smile descended on his pale, dispirited, face.\n“So you have deigned to come over, Lord Bushi – at long last?”\n“I found out only this morning, Pilkin. Shosh rang me.”\n“Hope the toll call didn’t bankrupt her!”\n“Come off it, Pilkin! You’re behaving like a spoiled brat!”\n“And suppose I am?”\n“Bitterness hurts the sufferer – how often did you tell me this?”\n“Often enough,” he muttered. “But just now I can’t get over it. It’s all so monstrously unfair!”\n“It probably is; but – then – who said life’s fair?”\n“True,” he agreed sadly. “And, Bushi, I didn’t mind the pain; the helplessness; the nuisance of having to lie still; and the smell of the ward. I can handle these.”\n“What then?”\n“I can’t go to the ‘loo! They put a pan under me; and then they carry it out; pfui!”\n“Don’t be silly; you are in a hospital.”\n“I know; but it’s humiliating!”\n“It’ll soon be over. You’ll be out, well and kicking before long!”\n“They’ll keep me here for another two or three weeks. And then I’ll be housebound for two or three months. David and his friends will have to carry me upstairs when I’m back in Tel Aviv. And it’ll be years before I can run up the stairs again! I’ll have to climb up like a zombie.”\n“That’ll be a nuisance; but – at least – you’ll be free to come and go,” I consoled him.\n“I suppose that something!” he retorted.\nFor a while I sat silently beside him, having nothing to say. When the silence became oppressive, I asked with trepidation: “What will you do when you are out of here? But I suppose there’ll be time enough to think of that?”\n“I think about it all the time.”\n“Well?”\n“I’ll have three options: the army will not offer me a permanent job but I think they’ll give me a year or two on probation, to see how it goes. The pay’s quite good but I shan’t accept: the army is for the well and fit! Another opening is TA.1. They’ve asked me to come back as a teacher. Enrolling in the Teacher’s Training Course is a pre-requisite. But the three years scholarship I’ll get on my discharge from the army will see me through. It’s a quite an attractive opening!”\n“When did they ask you?”\n“Last year. But I’m sure this business makes no difference!”\n“So you’ll accept?”\n“No, Bushi. My scholarship is OK for three years at the University and I can give some private tuition to see me through the rest of the course. This way I can study art and get ready for a career on the stage. And that’s what I always wanted!”\n“So that’s what you’ll do?”\n“Precisely!” He replied in a changed tone.\n“Wouldn’t it be safer to enrol in Law, Accountancy or perhaps Architecture?”\n“But I’m not interested in that stuff!” His animated voice, eager expression and determined air brought a smile to my face. Just for the moment he was – once again – my Pilkin of old!\n“I’ll cross my fingers for you,” I assured him.\n“Thanks. I’ll need all the support and luck I can get!”\nSome three weeks later Pilkin was transferred to his mother’s flat in Tel Aviv. His recovery took time. Initially, staircases were proscribed. For some two months he was housebound. Then, gradually, he started to take one set or stairs down from his mother’s apartment on the 4th floor and climbed back. After some three months he was once again mobile. Still, he had to walk slowly and, I noticed, had to hold on to the rails whenever possible. It was clear that the heart attack had taken its toll.\nDuring the entire period, I visited him regularly. Frequently, I brought some books with me. In addition, I cheered him up by telling him news about my office work and by relating gossip about former classmates.\n4. Dreaming Beyond Revovery It was during one such visit that Pilkin came up with a grand idea. To start with, he pointed out that, all in all, we were untravelled, even parochial. Trips to distant lands, such as India, were unfortunately beyond our means. But he thought that a trip to Europe was feasible. Italy and Greece were his priorities.\n“Also, Bushi, I want to see Turkey?”\n“Eh?”\n“It is the corridor leading from the Middle East to Europe. And, Bushi, Istanbul must be fascinating. Think about the Haga Sophia. Originally built as Byzantine church, later on turned into a mosque and – in modern times – into a museum.”\nHis words convinced me. I, too, wanted to see the places discussed by our History Master. Pilkin added that, in addition, he wanted to watch overseas theatre performances. In this respect, Paris and London struck him as the most suitable places. I, in turn, told him I wanted to visit my father in Vienna.\nPilkin realised that his proposed trip would be expensive. We should have to save hard for at least two years. All extravaganzas would have to be dropped in the meantime. Once we had put aside enough cash, it would be time to go.\n“But how about your health?” I asked with unease.\n“I’ll be fine in a few months, as long as I don’t overdo things and take care of myself. And I sure will! I want to see the world, Bushi!”\n“It involves a risk, Pilkin.”\n“I know. But I won’t let this silly heart attack curb my life forever.”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/reunion-in-zermatt/chapter-5/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"1-a-budding-actor\"\u003e1.

Pilkin's Heart Attack"},{"content":"10. I Change my Name to Loeb Zohar When I think today, as an aged retiree, about my returning to the status of a student, I feel I took a leap into the dark. In reality, my positions, at the ITV and before it at Tichon, were good. To change course at such a late stage involved courage and an optimistic outlook. I am glad I had them and have no regrets.\nMy course of studies in the Yeshiva was demanding; but I was able to take it in my stride. A great deal of time was devoted to studying the Talmud. The approach differed from the one I knew. The object was not so much to place the argumentation in the context of historical events but rather to come to grips with the highly skilled method of debating used throughout. The study of the Talmud itself did not, however, throw light on the prevailing principles to be used in daily life: the Halacha. These as well as Judaic philosophy were illuminated in medieval writings.\nForemost were Maimonides’ monumental books: the Mishneh Torah (colloquially called The Strong Hand) and the Guide for the Perplexed. The former sets out detailed principles respecting modes of daily conduct and all rituals respecting Jewish festivals. As Maimonides did not include in his tome references to sources, his work was subjected to criticism. A particular reason for this was that Maimonides was a Sephardic Jew, who lived most of his life in Egypt. The rites spelt out by him did not always correspond with the Halacha of European, viz. Ashkenazi, Jews. Still, the Mishneh Torah continues to be taught both in universities and in Yeshivot in Israel and overseas. Although the work was written in the 12th century, its clear Hebrew style remains a landmark.\nMaimonides’ other great work, the Guide for the Perplexed, was a philosophical tract seeking to reconcile Judaism with Aristotelian philosophy, showing that our religious tenets did not conflict with the philosophical teaching of the time. As might have been expected, the work became the subject of controversy. One school of thought asserted that in the course of writing Maimonides departed from the straight dogmas of Judaism. The book was, however, popular in Christianity and influenced many philosophers, such as Thomas Aquinas, who (about a century after Maimonides’ lifetime) sought to harmonize Aristotelian philosophy with the doctrines of the church.\nThe Guide for the Perplexed was not included in our syllabus. You could cover it on an autodidactic basis or as part of a course devoted to the sage’s writings. I tackled the work on my own, using the original, written in 1190 in Judeo-Arabic. In this instance, my command of Arabic stood me in good stead. I also made use of Hebrew translations.\nI was immersed in this tract, when Uri came over on a business trip. As we dined in a Kosher restaurant in Brooklyn, he came up with an interesting point.\n“Chayim, why did Maimonides write this book? The interests of his community were well served by his Mishneh Torah. It clarified the applicable principles.”\n“I suspect he wanted to reconcile our religious tenets with Greek philosophy.”\n“Doubtless,” agreed Uri, “but why was it not adequate for him to clarify the norms and rituals?”\n“Well, what do you think, Uri?”\n“Perhaps he wanted to show his disciples that our religion was compatible with Greek philosophy, which ruled supreme in his era. Actually, we face the very same problem today. Science has established that our planet is just a dot in a vast universe. Further, Darwin has elaborated and explained the principles of evolution. Modern scholars have accepted his theory as a sine qua non. And what have we done to harmonize these scientific findings with our religion?”\n“Actually, we haven’t done a thing,” I conceded. “We have taught observant Jews to stick to our rituals. Very few find the way to the core. And the vast majority of Jews are secular, except when they attend a service in the synagogue.”\n“Don’t you think this is an undesirable state of affairs? I know that reformists have done away with some antiquated laws. For instance, in a reform service men and women sit together. But some principles – like our dietary laws – are adhered to rigorously.”\n“Well, what do you suggest?”\n“The best way would be to reform our antiquated laws so as to harmonize them with the milieu of our modern world,” Uri spoke firmly.\n“The danger is that, if you go down this road, you assail not only the ritual but also the core.”\n“I am prepared to take the risk; but I know that the mainstream of Judaic learning won’t. As time passes, observant Jews are becoming a minority.”\nUri’s observation gave me food for thought. Were our Rabbis too rigorous? For instance, if you followed the prescribed rules, pressing the button summoning a lift was considered ‘work’. Accordingly, doing so on the Shabbat was proscribed. The only option was to walk up the stairs, unless you programmed the lift before Shabbat Eve to proceed on the basis of regular intervals. I suspected that elderly people found climbing the stairs more tiring (and hence harder ‘work’) than pressing a button. Still, the principle had not been amended.\nTo my surprise, Uri also brought me news respecting my brother, David. Uri had met him in London, had dinner in his place and was charmed by David’s English wife. I knew David and his wife had two sons and that one of them was in his first Form in school. Uri’s positive account firmed my decision to call on the family when I was next in the United Kingdom.\nLater in the year I studied Joseph Karo’s Shulchan Aruch, a book published in 1565. It had been referred to during my secondary school studies, but was a pivot of the studies in the Yeshiva. The book, which sets force all the ritualistic prescriptions of our faith, is regarded one of the most comprehensive codification of all relevant norms of Judaism. Like Maimonides, Karo was a Sephardic Jew. He wrote the book in Safed (Zfat) some two years prior to its publication. Unsurprisingly, sages in the European Diaspora, the Ashkenazim, took issue with some of the principles set out in it. However, one of the major Jewish schools of thought, namely Chabad (also known as Chabad-Lubavitch) came up with its own edited version of the book, which has thus remained one of the foremost guides to Judaism.\nKaro was not the only sage who resided in Safed. The eerie town in the Galilee was the centre of the Kabbala, which is the philosophic even if mystic exposition of the faith. Its most influential Rabbi, Isaac Luria Ashkenzi (commonly known as Ha’Ari), settled in Safed in 1570 and injected new life into the leading book of the movement: the Zohar (meaning ‘brightness’).\nI was deeply impressed by the Zohar and spent much time on it. In the course of doing so, it dawned on me that the role of an enlightened Rabbi was to maintain the ethnic unity of his flock, whilst adapting some peripheral norms to the needs of the day. I noticed with satisfaction that Rabbi Margalioth, who was well-versed in the vast volume of medieval Jewish writings, would allow frail members of his community to say their prayers whilst sitting although the norm was to recite some of them in a standing position.\nWhen I completed my reading of the great works, I decided to have a frank chat with my mentor. I knew that, in general, he had the reputation of strictly adhering to our principles and that he expected all his disciples to do likewise. At the same time, and as already mentioned, he often made allowance for members of the congregation. For instance, as some members lived far away from his Schul, he approved their driving to the synagogue. It was unrealistic to expect them to rent a room for the weekend in an adjacent hotel.\n“I know it appears inconsistent,” he told me when I raised these points with him, “but don’t forget that one of our cardinal principles is that ‘risk of soul overrides Shabbat’. I consider it important to see our members in our weekly services. It’s a matter of the ‘soul’. So I sanction their driving to the synagogue.”\n“In that case, why don’t we reform our religion altogether? What is the point of sticking to dietary laws, which most members do not observe outside the Schul?”\n“Some core values may not be altered, Chayim. Sha’ul of Tarsos, known to the world as St. Paul, strived to reform the basics; and you know that in the end he supported a break-away sect. He was lucky to survive the stoning to which our people condemned him.”\nMoshe Margalioth’s words left their impact. When I discussed this conversation with Yentl and added that many major tracts had been written in Safed she suggested that we spend a week there during our next visit to Israel.\nWe were, in any event, bound to travel before long. Although I was living in Brooklyn I had not given up my Israeli residence and, accordingly, was still bound to serve in the military if called up. I was aware of means used to avoid the duty but decided not to resort to them. Instead I undertook to serve in the Entertainment Corps a few weeks every year. Bennie Ornan helped me to formalize this arrangement.\nYentl and I flew to Tel Aviv in early July. It was warm and pleasant. Yentl arranged to stay with relatives during the time I spent in the army. I was free during weekends and so we were able to spend three days in Ramat Gan, with its splendid beaches. When I finished my militia service, we traveled to Safed.\nNowadays, when I am writing my autobiography as an aged retiree, Safed has become a tourist attraction. When Yentl and I arrived there in the seventies, Safed was a dreamy and aloof town, hiding behind its special mystic and long history. Still, even then it was the centre of the Kabbala; and many other sects had synagogues in the Old Jewish Quarter. It was also the abode of some Israeli artists and writers.\nBy the end of our week in town Yentl came up with an unexpected proposition. I was aware that before I met her, she had worked as a secretary in a charitable foundation. Telling me she had saved a fair amount of money during that time, she suggested that we buy a house in Safed.\n“But Yentl, you could invest that sum in profitable stocks or bonds. Do you really want to tie it down in a property?’\n“I do. You see, Chayim, bonds and shares have a speculative element. I am not a gambler; and – you know – our income is adequate for our needs. A holiday home in this lovely town is an extra asset and both of us love the place.”\n“So you don’t contemplate letting it out?”\n“I don’t! I want to spend our breaks here. And one day it may be our retirement residence.”\nMy initial idea was to find a house in the Old Jewish Quarter. Yentl thought that this part of Safed might, in due course, become the main tourists’ attraction. A house on the outskirts would be preferable and, in addition, less expensive. Today, when I live in this very cottage as an old retiree, I realise that Yentl’s prediction was realistic. Our house is close to amenities but far from the hustle and bustle of the centre.\nThe visit to Safed cleared yet a further question that arose in my mind. It struck me as odd that some traditional orthodox Jewish writers as well as those who embraced the Kabbala found in Safed a haven that spurred on their creative work. In effect, the two types of writing were worlds apart. Writers like Karo sought to elucidate and standardize the ritual principles of our faith. Their strength lay in the hard work involved in compiling and in arranging matters methodically and clearly. The Cabbalists, in contrast, were driven by the mystical wish to clarify the abstract core of our faith. Notably, one of their beliefs was that the deity had both a masculine and a feminine side: Ha’Shem and Ha’Schechina.\nDuring our visit to this charming town it dawned on me that the reclusive ambience and the mild climate enabled scholars to concentrate on their work without taking note of what transpired elsewhere. I, too, felt the pull. In the course of just four weeks I managed to re-read the leading work of the Kabbala, the Zohar, from cover to cover. I was affected by the poetic beauty and by the eerie nature of its thought pattern. Still, all in all, I continued to adhere to the traditional orthodoxy familiar to me.\nBack in New York, Yentl told me she was pregnant. Her genealogist thought she had conceived during our break in Israel. I was overwhelmed with joy: I was going to be a father. My line was not going to end with me.\n“Is it going to be a boy or a girl?” I asked Yentl.\n“They will tell me later on. And, you know, I have the feeling that I’ll bring a boy into the world. But does it really matter?”\n“Not in the slightest,” I assured her. “But Yentl, we must think about the name to be given to the baby.”\n“Well, what do you suggest?”\n“If we have a baby-boy, I’d like to call him Ami (‘My Nation’ in Hebrew). If you bear a baby-girl let us call her Ruth!”\n“Why Ruth?”\n“I hope she will be as devoted to you as the Biblical Ruth was to her stepmother Naomi. Also ‘Ruth’ is cute: I like the sound of it. But Yentl: you couldn’t have given me a nicer gift. So I shall be a parent! Wonderful!”\n“You mean: we shall be parents. So our marriage is fruitful!”\nWhen I reflect about that episode, I am satisfied that it was the happiest moment in my long life. It also clarified Yentl’s role. She felt that her task was to build up a happy and harmonious Jewish family. Unlike my first wife, Galya, Yentl put my well being above her own desires. She realised that by keeping me happy and satisfied she would achieve her goal in life.\nA few weeks later, it was confirmed that Yentl was carrying a boy. In due course, she gave birth. Labour and childbirth could be traumatic. Fortunately, Yentl remained positive. I suspect that my nervous tension, as I was pacing the corridor of the hospital after her admission, contrasted with her calm demeanour.\nA week after his birth, our son, Ami, was circumcised. The traditional ceremony was protracted. Usually, a new born was handed by the father to the medically trained Rabbi, who peeled off the newborn’s foreskin. Noting my nervousness, Rabbi Margalioth took over from me and showed the newborn around. He then handed him to the surgeon. Ami cried but calmed down when a towel soaked in wine was placed on his mouth.\nAfter that we followed the custom of drinking a glass of wine. Yentl looked at me with concern as my face darkened when all gathered yelled LeChayim (‘bottoms up’ in Hebrew) as they emptied their glasses.\n“Why were you displeased when people chanted ‘LeChayim’?” Yentl asked after the guests had left.\n“I don’t like the idea of being ‘Mr. Bottoms Up’!”\n“Aren’t you being too sensitive?”\n“Probably,” I agreed. “Still, I find such an occasion irritating.”\n“Then why not change your name?”\n“I’ve lived with it since my childhood. Still, what do you suggest?”\n“How about ‘Loeb’?”\n“Why Loeb? What do you like about it?”\n“If you change the pronunciation it means ‘heart’ (‘Lev’); it can also be construed as ‘lion’ (‘Lavie’). It suits you!”\n“I’ll think about it.”\n“And how about your surname? ‘Rosenne’ is becoming a common surname in Israel. You better change it to Zohar. You love the book; and ‘brightness’ describes our marriage.”\nAfter a few weeks I changed my name to ‘Loeb Zohar’ by deed poll, signed before an attorney in Brooklyn. I have kept this new name ever since. Naturally, I had to advise the Israeli authorities as well as the army. Initially, a bureaucratically minded clerk opined that, as I had remained an Israeli resident, the change of name should be effected locally. To avoid argument, I executed another deed poll before a lawyer in Tel Aviv.\nShortly after Ami’s first birthday, I was due to serve a few weeks in the Entertainment Corps. To my delight, Bennie Ornan advised that my services were not required. In consequence, we remained in Brooklyn. We missed Safed but both of us concluded that Ami was too young to take such a long flight. Fortunately, Yentl had asked one of our neighbours in Safed to look after our cottage while we were overseas.\nYentl turned out to be a typical Jewish Mother. Whenever Ami cried, she rushed over to make sure all was well. She also spent hours by his cot and showed him proudly to every person who came to visit. Occasionally, I felt neglected.\nMost of my time was spent on Talmudic tracts and Medieval Rabbinical writings. By the end of the year, I completed my further studies and was ordained. To my delight, Rabbi Margalioth invited me to become his deputy. Apart from my duties as Junior Rabbi, I was also expected to take care of the day-to-day running of the Jewish Wellbeing Foundation. Yentl’s skill as secretary was of major help.\nAnother talent I developed during this period was faith healing. I was, of course, unable to remedy physical defects like deafness or blindness. Where I was able to lend a hand was when a patient’s sufferings were exacerbated by fear or hallucinations. For instance, when Yentl’s father developed high blood pressure due to the stress experienced in the course of business, I was able to calm him down. His blood pressure thereupon corrected itself. Similarly, when colleagues suffered headaches as a result of being overworked, I was occasionally able to talk them out of it. Stresses incurred due to turmoil of home life were equally treatable. I managed to be of assistance by restoring things to normal.\nAmi was an active little boy. When he was about two years old, he walked and ran. Occasionally he tipped over but, once he regained his composure, he would go for another bout of activity. He also started to say a few words. Yentl insisted on breast feeding him. She felt confident that a mother’s milk was a baby’s best nourishment.\nShortly after Ami’s second birthday we flew to Israel. Yentl proceeded directly to Safed and I joined the Entertainment Corps. Altogether I served for four weeks. Bennie Ornan was glad to see me. His contract was renewed although he was due to retire.\nI spent one weekend in a hotel in Tel Aviv. My object was to look up Ronnie Eyal and Galya. Initially, I had lunch with Ronnie. To my disappointment, he looked haggard and worn out.\n“What’s the matter, Ronnie? Why are you so glum?”\n“Between us, Galya is becoming a handful.”\n“How?” I asked with concern.\n“She wants to play roles that are no longer suitable for her. Recently, she had a shouting match with Nina. Galya wanted the role of Juliet!”\n“Juliet – in Romeo and Juliet – is suitable for a rising star in her twenties. Galya is past this age. Haven’t you explained this to her?” I asked\n“I tried … and got it between my eyes. In the end we had an argument. I hate scenes, Chayim!”\n“I have changed my name to Loeb, Ronnie,” I tried to buy time.\n“To me you will always remain Chayim!”\n“Look here, Ronnie,” I told him after a few minutes. “Let me talk to her. I may be able to induce her to see sense.”\n“It’s worth a try.”\nWe fixed a second lunch, to be attended by the three of us. Ronnie undertook to be late so that I would have ample time for a chat with Galya. When I arrived, Galya was already there. While waiting for Ronnie, I told her that when I had met him a few days earlier, he looked tired and depressed.\n“Is it my fault?” she asked.\n“Only you know. He told me that there are some disputes about roles in forthcoming plays. That’s all he told me.”\n“Well, I want the role of Juliet; but your Nina is being difficult! She wants to give it to a newcomer!”\n“What attracts you to this role? Juliet is insipid! She is a young girl who cannot think clearly!”\n“She is the heroine of Shakespeare’s drama; and so I want it.”\n“Is Signon putting up another play?”\n“We are putting up Macbeth. Nina asked whether I should like to play Lady Macbeth.”\n“It is an exciting role. Lady Macbeth is quite a character. Don’t you prefer coming to grips with this challenge rather than playing Juliet?”\n“I want both!”\n“Don’t try to bite off more than you can chew. Rehearsing Lady Macbeth is not easy. Also, Lady Macbeth is a mature and sedate woman. Give this role a go; and don’t assume Nina is out to get you. She has many mouths to feed!”\n“I’ll think it over,” she replied. “But don’t you agree that Nina is just a conniving bitch? Why is she being so difficult?”\nRonnie’s arrival saved me the need to reply. A few days later, he rang to tell me that Galya decided to give a miss to Juliet and was, actually, graceful about it. She had overcome the feeling of persecution – akin to Paranoia – that had engulfed her. I realised that, once again, I had acted as healer, although in reality I helped Galya save face rather than faith.\nYentl, Ami and I enjoyed Safed. Yentl had decorated our cottage gracefully. It became a second home. In many ways I preferred it to our comfortable yet mundane dwelling in Brooklyn. Ami liked the Luria shrine. He walked up to the usually secluded podium, took in the colourful display of the curtain of the shrine housing the Torah scrolls (the ‘Parochet’) and generally made himself at home. Later in the week we went for a long walk and had a pleasant picnic. Ami was by then able to talk and also walked briskly.\nI was sad when a few weeks later we returned to Tel Aviv and took a flight to New York. During the journey I was immersed in a part of the Zohar. Yentl looked at me thoughtfully. Did she realise that, one day, Safed would become our abode?\nBack in the Yeshiva, I had a long chat with Rabbi Moshe Margalioth. Yentl had told him of my immersion in the Zohar. He wanted to know whether my studies shook my faith in the straight and narrow line of orthodoxy practised by us. Although I was by then his deputy and a Rabbi, I preferred to continue addressing him formally.\n“No, Rabbi Margalioth: my faith remains intact. But I wonder what unifies all the sects that have emerged in our religion. Do you know the answer?”\n“You too know it. Start by asking yourself: what is the core?”\n“Our belief in a single all-mighty creator, who has chosen us from amongst all other nations.”\n“Correct answer. This belief unites us. One further norm is common ground: we maintain that the Messiah (the savior) is yet to come. In this regard we differ from the Christians, who believe that Jesus Christ was the Messiah.”\n“So festivals and norms – the ritual – are paraphernalia?”\n“They are indeed. But they hold us together.”\n“In other words, regardless of whether you embrace the Kabbala, Chabad or Traditional Orthodoxy you remain within the fold. Once you accept that Jesus was the Messiah, you have crossed the border.”\n“Well spoken,” he agreed.\n“But don’t we have to analyze the nature of God? What does the word mean?”\n“He is the God of our Torah! As long as you remain in the fold, you need not discuss the matter further.”\n“I agree,” I smiled at him. “When Elijah the prophet is privileged to encounter God, we are told: ‘And behold the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and broke the rocks in pieces before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake; and after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire; and after the fire a still small voice.’ (Kings I, 19:11-12): the gentle word of persuasion.”\n“The essence of our religion,” agreed Moshe Margalioth.\nMy next three years as Margalioth’s deputy were smooth and uneventful. My family traveled to Israel once a year. Usually, Yentl and Ami proceeded directly to Safed and I joined them as soon as my militia service was complete. Ami, who mixed with other children in the neighborhood, became fluent in Hebrew.\nDuring that very period I had further experiences in faith healing. Both in Brooklyn and in Safed people asked for my help. Usually I was able to aid them in overcoming fear and nervousness. I also adopted Margalioth’s liberal approach. For instance, I recall how one bright morning our next door neighbour in Safed, Miriam Porat, came over to show me a chicken she was going to roast. To her dismay, she discovered that the bird’s stomach was pierced by a pin. Under our strict principles, such a defect rendered the chicken ‘unclean’ (non Kosher). It would have to be discarded. However, I knew that Miriam’s family was not well-off. I solved the problem by advising her that the chicken’s entrails had to be discarded but that the chicken itself was Kosher.\nDuring the entire period, in which I assumed the role of the Junior Rabbi in Moshe Margalioth’s synagogue, only three events left an impact. The first was the birth of our daughter, Ruth. The second was a lengthy and seminal conversation with my friend Uri. The last occurred during my trip to the United Kingdom; it drove a spanner in my relationship with my brother, David.\nRuth was born in 1979, just two years after Ami’s arrival. Yentl conceived during one of our sojourns in Safed. She injured herself in the course of our bumpy flight to New York and frequently felt ill during the remaining months of her difficult pregnancy. I tried to boost her morale but was unable to help. Our gynecologist wanted to perform an abortion dictated by medical considerations. Yentl would not hear of it. She was determined to bring a newborn into our world.\nI recall my panic when Dr. Levi emerged from the hospital theatre in which Yentl went through her labors.\n“Rabbi Zohar,” he told me, “we need to perform a caesarian section. We shall do our best to save mother and child. But what do you want us to do if we have an emergency: I mean if we cannot save both?”\n“Yentl is … dear to me,” I stammered. “I cannot face losing her. Yentl’s life is the foremost priority.”\nFor some two hours I tried to immerse myself in the psalms. However, my effort to remain calm was futile. The sun to me was dark; and my blood pressure continued to rise. Before long, I felt palpitations: Yentl had become the centre of my life. The thought of losing her tormented me.\nI felt genuine relief when Dr. Levi re-emerged with a smile on his face.\n“You have a daughter and your wife is fine, Rabbi. But a further pregnancy is inadvisable for the next four years. We may not be so lucky if she conceives earlier than that.”\n“But Yentl is already 36 years old. In four years her child-bearing age will be over,” I told the gynecologist.\n“True,” he agreed. “You will have to explain the position to her.”\n“I suppose that we shall have to do with just one son and one daughter.”\nInitially, Yentl rebelled. Her dream was to have four children. I had to ask Dr. Levi to explain the position to her. I think that his persuasions were effective. I, too, played a role. I told her bluntly that we have to accept the rough with the smooth. Some couples remained childless; we were lucky to have a son and a daughter. We would discharge our duty by bringing them up properly, by giving each a fine education and by directing them on the road leading to a happy existence. In the long run it would be better to concentrate on what God had granted us than ignoring a plain warning and throwing caution aside.\nAfter a few days, Yentl gave way. I believe that a lengthy conversation with Rabbi Margalioth helped her to make up her mind.\nUri visited me shortly after Ruth was born. We went for dinner to the very same restaurant in Brooklyn in which we had lunched years earlier. It was clear to me that Uri had developed from the youth who attended my classes in Tichon to a mature man in his mid-thirties. He was heavy-set, radiated confidence and his keen expression confirmed that he remained intellectually curious.\nShortly after we ordered our dishes, Uri produced a photograph of his family. It displayed Uri with his arm around his attractive wife. Their kids were standing in front of them and smiled into the camera.\n“Are you going to have another?”\n“I don’t think so. We want to give each of them a good education. Another child has to be ruled out on financial grounds.”\n“Aren’t you doing well enough? I thought you became a successful businessman.”\n“I’ve done well and my new enterprise is good. But do you know how much it costs to enroll a child in a secondary school and in a university?’\n“I thought education was free,” I told him.\n“Not if you have my sort of income. If we have another child and want to do the right thing by him or her, Rina will have to start working again. Finding a new job should not be difficult: she is highly qualified. But I really think that, if it is financially possible, a mother’s place is with her children.”\n“I agree,” I told him. “Actually, which good wind blew you over to us?”\n“I am trying to get some interested parties to take up a stake in my business. They live in Manhattan. I came over to Brooklyn because I wanted to catch up with you. And I want to raise a question that has been bothering me for years.”\n“Go ahead, my curious friend!”\n“Well, I wanted to discuss a philosophical issue. I keep wondering: what is the core of our faith?”\n“Surely, the worship of one God, who has chosen us, and the belief that the Messiah will come at the end of time (the ‘final days’). Isaiah puts it neatly. He tells us to comprehend that ‘I [God] am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall be after me’ (Isa. 43:10) adding that we are his chosen people.”\n“A correct textbook answer. Well, if this is so, why can’t we do away with outdated ritual and with norms such as our dietary laws? Few of us observe them when we are outside the synagogue.”\n“They reinforce the core, Uri.”\n“You mean that, without them, the ‘core’ cannot stand?”\n“Well, let me have your view. It is obvious that you have given much thought to this subject.”\n“When Jews attend a service it comprises prayers held in a language which most of them do not comprehend. If they seek to understand what they articulate, they have to consult a translation. Further, they follow norms and ritual blindly. I suspect that these norms and ritual have actually become the core of their faith.”\n“But these norms and the ritual keep us united,” I pointed out. “And they reinforce our belief in One God.”\n“They do; but don’t forget that monotheism is not unique to us. Christianity and Islam assert the existence of a single God. And long before Judaism proclaimed the faith in one God, Pharaoh Akhenaton did so. In reality, what separates us from other people is the adherence to our norms and ritual. These set us apart as an ethnic group.”\n“I don’t agree. I think the norms and ritual complement the core. But even if you are right, the norms and ritual cannot be discarded. In that case, they constitute the essence and we have to embrace them.”\n“But, then, if you don’t, you cease to be Jewish!”\n“Not as long as long as you adhere to our monotheistic core and accept that we are the chosen ones.”\n“And this segregation breeds anti-Semitism, doesn’t it?”\n“The rest of the world is inclined to visit the ‘sins’ of the individual on the entire congregation,” I muttered defensively.\nFor a while both of us were immersed in our thoughts. I realised that Uri’s views were shared by many members of the faith, who had discarded the core and became agnostics. Still, most of them – including Uri – remained in the fold. It was a system even if it was void of reason.\nThe arrival of the desserts saved the need to discuss the issue any further. Over aromatic black coffees, Uri told me that on his way to New York he had made a stop in London and paid a visit to my brother, David.\n“David wrote a short note a while ago to tell me that he was moving to Birmingham,” I told Uri.\n“I know. He is being appointed a branch manager. He told me that he fears you are distancing yourself from him. Is that so?”\n“I am afraid so. My job and personal life keep me very busy.”\n“Is this estrangement due also to his having married out?”\n“To a certain extent,” I confirmed.\n“Well let me tell you that Clare is charming. David is a lucky man; and he is proud of her. David was never as traditional as you. When he met a woman as splendid as Clare, he fell for her. I am sure he would be glad if you visited them.”\nMy visit to David took place a few weeks later. Moshe Margalioth asked me to visit our supporters, practically the donors, in Europe. I agreed but felt uneasy when he asked me to put on the typical black silk suit.\n“But look here, Loeb,” he told me. “You had no objection to growing a beard. So why are you uneasy about the clothes?”\n“Aren’t they anachronistic? Surely, our forefathers in Judea did not wear such attire. These are Turkic clothes, which our European ancestors may have adopted after the Khazars converted to Judaism.”\n“Very likely,” he agreed readily. “But by now they have become a sort of a uniform. So what do you have against them?”\n“Very well,” I muttered, feeling that all in all his words made sense.\nThe flight to London took some eight hours. After contacting our followers, I rang David. He was glad to hear from me and invited me to come over for lunch at their place the next day. I was glad to accept.\nClare struck me as a pleasant and homely woman. The meal she cooked was excellent and our dietary laws sanctioned my partaking. David’s children were cute and his house, though modest, was neat and well decorated. After lunch, we had coffee and then I returned to my hotel. Before I left, David suggested that I dine with him in his club.\nIt was agreed that I should take a taxi from the hotel and pick David up on the way to the club. To my surprise, David had left before my arrival. Clare asked me to come in. I recall our conversation vividly.\n“David forgot to refer to the dress code of his club. I tried to contact you but you had already left the hotel. Would you like to use one of David’s suits?”\n“What’s wrong with my clothes?”\n“You put on orthodox attire,” she explained uneasily. “You may not feel comfortable if you wear it in the club.”\n“I see,” I replied when I recovered from my shock. “But, Clare, David and I are of a different build. And in any event, I am what I am.”\n“Of course you are. And we are not seeking to influence your orientation. It is only for this occasion. I have taken out David’s best suit; it will fit you. Please try it on.”\n“No, thank you. I’ll have my evening meal in a restaurant in Golders Green. And now I have to go. The taxi is waiting for me.”\n“You mean you won’t dine with David.”\n“Some other time perhaps. And now I must really go.”\n“David … will be … very disappointed,” she stammered.\n“Give him my regards,” I brought the conversation to its close.\nDuring the first course I still felt hurt and disappointed. I calmed down over an excellent dish of goose. I told myself that David was ascending the social ladder in an alien country. Naturally, we could have arranged to have dinner in the very restaurant in which I had my meal. David’s invitation for dinner in his club had been misguided. Still, it was made in good faith. The dress code, though, should have been mentioned when he invited me.\nWhen I came back to my hotel after watching a play in the West End I was given a message left by David. He asked me to ring him as soon as possible. However, it was too late to ring instantly and I had to leave very early next morning.\n“Please ring back and tell them I checked out before the message was delivered,” I asked the receptionist and gave her a handsome tip.\nA few days later David sent me an apologetic letter. I sent him a formal reply. Somehow, the incident undermined our family relationship. During my next trips to the United Kingdom I called on our affiliates in London and in Manchester. I could have built in a stop over in Birmingham, where David resided, but decided not to do so.\nDavid kept writing to me sporadically. The only time I met him again was at Mother’s funeral. Years later, Clare wrote to inform me of David’s demise. Pressure of work and chain smoking resulted in a massive stroke, which he did not survive. She asked me whether I would attend the funeral, which was to be held in their church. “David saw light late in his life and joined our congregation,” she explained.\nClare had sent the communication to my address in Brooklyn. It was forwarded to my address in Safed, where I resided as a retiree, but reached me well after the date of the funeral. I sent Clare a letter of condolence and explained that I had received her communication after the burial.\nI have not been in contact with David’s family ever since. It continued to grieve me that my late brother had left the fold. Nowadays, I have second thoughts. Was I was too rigid? After all, faith is a personal matter. I have never scolded close friends who became free thinkers. Why then could I not tolerate my brother’s act?\n11. A Liberal Rabbi in Brooklyn My next few years as Moshe Margalioth’s deputy were quiet. A number of events, though, left their impact on me.\nOne took place shortly after Yentl and I returned to Brooklyn following some six weeks in Israel. Rabbi Margalioth caught a bad cold and lost his voice. This meant that I had to act as cantor. Reciting the weekly Parasha – namely, the section of the Pentateuch read out by the Rabbi after the morning service on Shabbat – did not present a problem. During my studies in the Yeshiva, I had mastered the art of leading a prayer session and of reciting passages from the Bible.\nDelivering a sermon (Drasha) was a new task. Initially, I offered to read out a sermon composed by Moshe Margalioth. My mentor would not hear of it.\n“You are a Rabbi, Loeb. It is high time that you master the art of preparing the weekly sermon.”\n“I did not anticipate this,” I mumbled. “You are the leader of our congregation.”\n“But you are my deputy. You must be able to take over whenever I am unavailable. And, you know, I too had to compose sermons when my predecessor was sick.”\nThe composition of a Drasha is a fine art. It must relate, directly or indirectly, to the Pentateuch passage read out that day. In this regard I was fortunate. That week’s Parasha was Balak (Num. 22-24), which relates how the King of Moab, Balak, asked Balaam the Aramite to travel to Canaan, which the Israelites proposed to conquer. Balak’s object was to induce Balaam to curse the would-be conquerors. Instead, the seer blessed these foes, describing them as a nation which dwells apart from all others (Num. 23:9).\nBalaam’s blessings are amongst the finest pieces of poetry in the Old Testament. Further, they were topical in our own time because they underscored the need of keeping ourselves segregated. It was, therefore, easy to relate the passage from Numbers to the problems of our own modern era. By doing so, a Rabbi like me is able to argue forcefully that the words, written down in the remote past, have not lost their relevance.\nWhen working on my sermon, I realised that one further aspect was essential. During my years with Margalioth, I noted that frequently the members of the congregation did not absorb the Drashas. The main reason for this was that the sermon came as an anti-climax: The Rabbi delivered it after the conclusion of the morning prayers and the reading of the Parasha. Further, usually the sermon was heavy. The listeners got tired during its delivery. I concluded that the best remedy was to liven up the address. In the case of Balak this was easy. The text tells us how Balaam saddled his ass and rode to his mission. On his way a sword-brandishing Angel confronted him. The ass saw the angel and sought to avoid it, whereupon Balaam, who did not see the Angel, smote the ass; and then “the Lord opened the mouth of the ass” (Num. 22:28), and it apprised Balaam of the situation.\nDuring my years in Tichon, we often used the paraphrased words when a classmate gave a foolish answer to a question put to him by the teacher. When, years later, I prepared my sermon in Brooklyn, I added that frequently asses opened their mouths without divine stimulation. Those who were listening broke into hilarious laughter. Those who didn’t wanted to know what the Rabbi had said. To accommodate them, I repeated my words.\nNowadays, when I compose my autobiography, I can say with confidence that there is a similarity between the role of an actor and a Rabbi’s. Both endeavor to hold the attention of their audience. An actor seeks to ensure that his spectators follow the plot and appreciate the message. A Rabbi’s object is to draw his congregation’s attention to the manifestation of our Bible’s significance to issues arising in the present era. Yet a further similarity between an actor and a Rabbi is that both need to project themselves. For instance, when an actor bangs the table his purpose is not only to underscore his words but also to impress the viewers with his zeal. Similarly, a Rabbi often draws the congregation’s attention to himself by raising his voice. Adding a lighthearted joke to a serious message had a similar object.\nRabbi Margalioth was puzzled by my approach. He wanted to know whether, in my opinion, the cracking of jokes was appropriate on a serious occasion like the delivery of a sermon. He was mollified when I assured him that my sole object was to keep the congregation interested in the topic covered.\nHe must have considered the matter because, a few days later, he asked me to take over the short address to be delivered after the evening service. On this occasion I did not crack any jokes and, actually, drew on the works of Maimonides to analyze the meaning of some of our prayers. Margalioth wanted to know why I had been light hearted when delivering the Saturday sermon but remained serious when addressing the believers who attended our daily evening prayer.\n“They are different audiences, Rabbi Margalioth,” I replied. “Many of the people who attend our Shabbat services do so in order to affirm their ethnic affiliation with our people. To them an entirely serious oration is overbearing. So I try to enliven the address in order to preserve their interest. The people who come to our evening services are, usually, staunch believers. A lighthearted talk may put them off.”\n“I get your point,” he agreed. Thereafter he frequently asked me to deliver the address in our daily prayers and also the Saturday morning sermon. Our ultra-orthodox colleagues took objection to my approach to the Drasha. People, though, started to attend our sessions rather than their synagogue’s. Before long, my addresses became popular. My orthodox colleagues shook their heads sadly and berated me. In their eyes, I attained notoriety rather than fame. My view differed.\nOccasionally, it was difficult to lace a sermon with lighthearted reflections. For instance, Rabbi Margalioth asked me to deliver the sermon following the reading of the dull Parashat Shemini (Lev. 9-11), which spells out (Lev. 11-1:31) the dietary laws. We are told that “these you shall not eat of them that chew the cud [regurgitate], or, of them that divide the hoof: the camel, because he chews the cud, but does not part the hoof” (Lev. 11:4). After explaining the nature of this proscription, I added that although the camel invoked my admiration for being able to cross marshes in which a horse driven cart would get stuck, the camel never struck me as a palatable morsel. The audience laughed and, I felt certain, would recall the edict as well as the general principle.\nAn orthodox visitor from Israel, Rabbi Mendel Schulman, grimaced when I cracked my joke. In contrast, Rabbi Margalioth grinned. I felt satisfied and, the truth be told, was not perturbed by our distinguished visitor’s disapproval. It dawned on me that, if the fate of our creed remained in unbending hands, our congregations would continue to shrink.\nRegrettably, the matter was raised after a dinner which Margalioth hosted in our visitor’s honour. As we were served our main courses Rabbi Schulman told me emphatically:\n“Our Shabbat service is a solemn occasion. It should not be trivialized by jokes incorporated in the Drasha.”\n“I do not detract from the solemnity of the service. I incorporate the jokes so as to hold my audience’s attention; they react favourably to them. In point of fact, our service is becoming popular.”\n“I know that,” Schulman replied angrily. “Some of the members of our own Schul in Brooklyn have started to attend your Shabbat service.”\n“Surely, Mendel’e, that is up to them,” interjected Rabbi Margalioth. “We welcome all members of our faith.”\nFor a few minutes our guest continued to fume. Then he shrugged his shoulders. Did he understand that an argument was futile? When our visitor left, Rabbi Margalioth asked me not to judge Rabbi Schulman harshly.\n“He had a sad experience, Loeb,” he told me. “His son went to Princeton on a scholarship and, to the surprise of all of us, renounced our faith and embraced Roman Catholicism. Rabbi Schulman took it hard. He severed all contacts with his son and refers to the young man only as ‘that rascal’. I suspect Rabbi Schulman has not recovered from the blow.”\n“I understand. I too am experiencing this type of chagrin. My own brother, David, married out. In due course he may convert to his wife’s faith.”\n“How do you take it?” he asked me.\n“I am trying to tell myself that this type of attrition is unavoidable. Some statistics establish that if all our offspring had remained with us, there would be far more Jews in the world. And I fear that many of our brethren adhere to our traditions only within the precinct of the synagogue.”\n“Does this concern you?” he wanted to know.\n“We have to live with it. As I have already told you, I try to breathe some light air into our gatherings. Still, our numbers are bound to dwindle. It is sad; but unavoidable. Our reluctance to accept converts is also a factor. Unlike Christianity and Islam we do not proselytize.”\n“I fear you are right,” Margalioth groaned. For a few minutes he remained silent. Then he added: “My own son – his name is Isaac – has ceased to follow our traditions. He says that he is a ‘free thinker’ or an ‘agnostic’ and that he ‘cannot be bothered with nonsense’. For years, I had anticipated that one fine day he would be able to take over from me. He has dashed my hopes.”\n“I am sorry to hear this,” I told my mentor. “What does he do for a living?”\n“He is a successful businessman. I meet him from time to time. Unlike Rabbi Schulman, I am not prepared to break contact with my son.”\n“Does Isaac come to any services?”\n“He attends Schul on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. He comes so as to please me. I suspect that, when I am gone, he will cease to attend altogether.”\nWhen I think about these events nowadays, as an aging retiree, I have come to realise that Judaism is on the decline. We have too many factions and frequently are not clear about the issues in dispute. What keeps us going is segregation which, in turn, breeds anti-Semitism, which – in its own way – encourages isolation. It is a cul-de-sac. Here in Safed I am no longer a party to the ongoing debate: I have become my own man.\nThe years kept passing. Both Ami and Ruth were growing. Ami had attended a Jewish kindergarten but, shortly after his sixth birthday, was ready to start his primary school education. I was inclined to enroll him in a traditional school, which emphasises courses on Judaism. Yentl took a different view. She thought that our regular trips to Israel, where Ami mixed with local children, and the idols of the home would instill in him the required traditional approach to life. His general education, she opined, should be broader. We ought to enroll him in an American school of standing so as to prepare him for his odyssey. Our traditional Jewish home would secure his integration in our community in New York.\nInitially, I objected, arguing that Jewish schools had a sufficiently broad curriculum. In my opinion his future would best be served by a traditional upbringing augmented by his being given the opportunity to study French or Spanish. I was – and have remained satisfied – that English literature and a command of Hebrew culture were narrow. France had a rich literature as indeed did Spain. Further, I wanted to prepare Ami for a career in Europe or in South America.\nIn the end, we compromised. Ami was to attend a fine general school but, in addition, was to study Hebrew and our literature. We also enrolled him in French language classes.\nSome two years later, Ruth was enrolled in a traditional Jewish school in Brooklyn. On this occasion Yentl and I were at one. Yentl took the view that, unlike a boy, whose role would be to earn an income adequate for the needs of his family, a woman’s function was to have a family and guard its harmony and happiness. Further, if the girl was of our faith, she would normally build up a traditional home. A conventional upbringing would stand her in good stead. I agreed but thought it important that Ruth acquire a second language. As in Ami’s case, we settled on French. As we spoke Hebrew at home at least two days a week, our children became trilingual.\nToday, when I am thinking about the discussions that took place, I regret that neither Yentl nor I appreciated the importance of encouraging the children to study Chinese. In our era, the importance of China had not yet dawned on the Western world. I am glad to tell that Ruth’s two children – my grandchildren – are conversant in Mandarin.\nAnother dent in our approach has to be conceded. Yentl and I assumed that children would follow in the steps of their parents. Nowadays I have come to accept that each generation deviates from the path trodden by its predecessor.\nThis generation gap is universal. For instance, today everybody with a basic education appreciates that the earth is not flat and that the heavens – the cosmos – is vast. We know that our own planet (the earth) is just a tiny dot in a universe that keeps expanding. People with an orthodox orientation like mine believe that, regardless of its size, the universe was created by God. People like my friends Uri and Bushi regard our Bible as passé. They appreciate that it is a literary masterpiece but do not accept it as a reliable historical source. Still, although they boast of having become agnostics, ethnic affiliation induces them to remain within the fold.\nYentl and I aged whilst our children were growing. I was by now in my fifties and Mother, too, had aged. For decades she stayed quite comfortably in the very flat in which I grew up in the south of Tel Aviv. Occasionally, David and I sent her extras so as to ensure that she did not want. Her needs were often the subject discussed in the sporadic correspondence I maintained with him.\nThen, in 1984, Mother had a stroke. One of her neighbours, a Good Samaritan, rang to advise me. As I was in any event due for a stretch of militia service, I flew over within two days. Yentl and the children accompanied me. We arrived just after David had left. Before his departure, he found a good nursing home. We transferred Mother to it after she was discharged from the hospital.\nThe in-house physician advised me that Mother’s stroke did not endanger her life. Regrettably, she lost the command of her limbs and became incontinent. He thought that the prognosis for full recovery was negative. Mother was bound to remain an invalid for the rest of her life. However, her cognitive functions remained intact. Provided she was given good care, she would remain around for a few more years. He also assured me that a second stroke was unlikely.\n“But look here Rabbi Zohar. Your Mother needs a focus so as to support her will to live. This must not be impaired.”\n“We can install a television set in her room,” I assured him.\n“In my opinion, you should also be in touch with her regularly and, if possible, encourage your children to write to her. Letters and telephone calls will make her feel wanted and relevant.”\n“I’ll bear this in mind,” I agreed.\nIn the next exchange of letters I communicated this advice to David. Thereafter, we took turns in ringing her up and in writing. I am satisfied that we did all we could to keep her mind occupied. She remained with us for another four years. She then caught an attack of pneumonia and passed away. I was is Israel at the time and so was able to attend her funeral. David managed to fly over in time but had to return to his position in Birmingham after two days.\nI recall the dire funeral. Only six acquaintances attended. A few students of a nearby seminary came over so as to make up a Minyan, that is, the compulsory ten Jewish males to be present when prayers are recited. The service was led by the Rabbi of the community. My role, as her oldest son, was confined to saying the Kaddish (the blessing).\nA brief address followed. The Rabbi chose a well-known passage from the Bible about a ‘woman of worth’ (Prov. 31:11-end), praising my Mother’s thrift and ability to manage her family’s affairs after she had lost her husband. My own thoughts drifted in another direction. All in all, my Mother was born, got married early in her life and looked after her offspring till they matured. But would she be remembered after David and I met our appointed days? The vainglory involved pained me. Was this the lot of all human beings? Few of us would be as much as mentioned after we perished, except if we achieved fame or notoriety. I felt sad and disheartened. Was this then the fate of all human beings?\nYentl, who was standing beside me, watched my face intently: “A penny for your thoughts, Loeb.”\n“I disagree,” she said firmly after she had listened to my reflections. “Your late Mother achieved a great deal. She was proud of you, the Rabbi, and of David, who became a Branch Manager in Birmingham. Your success was hers. I don’t think she sought to be remembered by posterity. She performed to the best of her ability and was pleased with the outcome. And she lived to see her grandchildren. What more, do you think, did she aspire to?”\n“You may very well be right,” I conceded after a few minutes.\nDavid, who stood beside us, expressed his agreement with Yentl. I sensed that he wanted to have a heart to heart chat with me. Regrettably, I was not in a talkative mood. Nowadays, when I am living as a retiree in Safed and have outlived David, I believe I missed an opportunity for a full reconciliation with my brother.\nOur visits to my Mother had usually taken place just before I went for my militia service. Before she succumbed to the stroke, we used to stay with her in the old apartment. She had turned one of the bedrooms in the apartment into a guest room. David and his family stayed there when he visited her; our family took over when we came to Israel.\nThese sojourns led to an involvement with the synagogue in the south of Tel Aviv, which David and I had frequented years earlier. To my disappointment I found that the synagogue had not been looked after properly; it was dilapidated and the ark boasted few Torah scrolls. The Rabbi-in-Charge told me that many members of the community had left. Occasionally, the congregation had to wait for the arrival of the last person needed to form a Minyan. He was glad to hear that, whenever I was in Tel Aviv, I would attend the daily morning and evening services.\nOur prayer meetings, though, were lackluster. The Ashkenazi intonation of the prayers, a sing song which led to the muffling of the words spoken, meant that some of the attendants were unable to follow, and waited eagerly for the body language which indicated that it was time for each worshipper to recite the Amidah (also known as ‘18’) that is, the dedication prayer said by individuals in undertone whilst standing and then repeated vocally by the cantor.\nYentl and I attended the communal luncheons held after the Shabbat morning service. At the Rabbi-in-Charge’s suggestion I delivered the address given following the second course. As I laced my speech with jokes; all in attendance applauded. Before long, I became a popular speaker.\nA year later, the Rabbi invited me to convey the Shabbat morning sermon which followed the reading of the Parasha. Here, too, people liked my lightheartedness. I do believe they listened eagerly to my words. The main topical message of my sermons was the praise of tolerance and moderation. It left its mark.\nA discussion with the Rabbi-in-Charge revealed that lack of funds was a major problem faced by his synagogue. When I related this to Rabbi Margalioth in New York, he suggested that we step in and provide funding. In due course, this synagogue in Tel Aviv became affiliated to our institution in Brooklyn. Thereafter, sponsored support for this synagogue kept growing as indeed did the number of participants.\nProblems emerged when Mother had to be moved to the sanatorium in the north of Tel Aviv. Yentl and I rented a small flat close to it, which gave me the luxury of being near a beach. Frequently I went for a swim before breakfast. The flat, though, was far from the synagogue in the south of Tel Aviv. On religious grounds, the taking of a cab was out of question. Walking so far away from the centre (Te’chum) was equally proscribed. We solved our problem by residing in the old flat in the south end of Allenby Street, visiting Mother only after Shabbat was over. It meant that, on Saturdays, we did not see her during daytime.\nQuite a separate issue related to our cottage in Safed. Frequently, we could spend only two or three weeks in it. A reprieve came when I was notified that my militia service in the Entertainment Corps was no longer required. I might still be summoned once in three years but, in point of fact, I ceased to be called up. In a sense, this was a relief. As Bennie Ornan had retired and settled in Tiberias, I no longer felt the need to volunteer. Thereafter, we usually managed to spend about four weeks in our second home. All four of us – that is, Yentl, Ami, Ruth and I – loved it. We often felt pangs when we flew back to the United States.\nDuring the time I spent in Tel Aviv, I frequently called on Ronnie Eyal. He told me that Nina had opted for early retirement. She and her companion, Miri, settled in Nahariya, in the north of Israel, in a small house close to the beach. Ronnie believed they were happy. Nina had told him, in so many words, that she was glad to ‘have seen the last of Signon’. She thought that ‘a younger and hungrier person’ ought to take over her post.\n“I am glad they were able to afford a house in Nahariya,” I told Ronnie.\n“Well, their flat in Tel Aviv fetched a good price. Property prices outside Tel Aviv and Jerusalem remain affordable.”\n“Did they have a pension?”\n“They did; and both of them are thrifty. They live on the pensions and on their savings. Further, I believe Miri, who has a good head, spotted excellent investments.”\n“Is Leo Shalev still with Signon?”\n“No, Loeb, he became a heavy drinker. A few years ago he died from liver cancer”.\n“Aren’t you going to retire?” I asked my friend.\n“They have extended me for the second time. And they won’t find a light expert as good as I,” he grinned, adding after a moment: “Galya needs me there. I have become a real caregiver: she consults me on every move.”\n“What are they putting on next season?”\n“They have decided on An Inspector Calls. It is bound to be a box office success.”\n“I’m surprised they are not staging an Israeli drama.”\n“A play by Amos Oz is going to be shown later in the year.”\n“Is Galya playing a role?”\n“She is playing Mrs. Berling in Priestley’s play. She no longer tries to play roles appropriate for younger actresses. Mrs. Berling is just suitable.”\n“I am glad that I managed to help you smooth out that issue,” I grinned.\nFor a few minutes Ronnie kept his silence. I sensed that he wanted to tell me something but was hesitant. It seemed best to wait. I knew that Ronnie trusted me but that, usually, he was tightlipped. Many Holocaust survivors had this trait: a craving for privacy that overcame their inclination to relate their personal experiences.\nWhen at long last he decided to talk, he reminded me that Galya was his second wife.\n“I recall that your first wife’s name was Hilda. The Nazis annulled marriages of Aryans to Jews. You managed to escape and ended up in Tel Aviv.”\n“So I did; and I changed my name and started afresh.”\n“I remember, Ronnie. And you re-married after Hilda was presumed dead. You had not heard from her for seven years following the end of WWII.”\n“Well, Chayim: two years ago she reappeared.”\n“What??? … What took her so long?” I exclaimed, without reminding Ronnie that I had changed my name to Loeb.\n“It is a complex story. I think I told you that Hilda joined the Red Cross. Her entire team was hit by one of the bombs dropped on Dresden. She said she was shell-shocked, lost her memory and was hospitalized. After recovering she started to look for me and for her son.”\n“Amnesia of this type is rare. Is it possible that, for a while, she focused on someone else? And as to looking for you: wasn’t this easy? Neither of you hid his tracks.”\n“I can only relate what she told me. And looking for us was not easy. You see, both of us had changed our surnames. Also, she didn’t know I had migrated to Palestine. It took her some time to locate us.”\n“Actually, how did she?”\n“She searched for Ronald Hirsh. Fortunately, there was a record of Ronald Hirsh’s sea voyage to Haifa. She knew I had a flare for light effects. So she looked up photographs of the staff members of theatres. By sheer luck she got a collective photo of Signon’s team.”\n“How did she contact you?”\n“One bright morning I received a letter, in which she announced her intention to come over.”\n“And you replied? I thought she jilted you when Adolf Hitler seized power?”\n“She did rather; but Chayim I had been deeply in love with her. I adored her. Emotions of this sort leave their mark. I had re-married but, nevertheless, wanted to see her again. You see, Chayim, my first union was one of mutual love.”\n“I understand; but how about your marriage to Galya?”\n“My marriage to her was based on understanding. It was not a romance. Galya needed a caregiver; and I was available. You could say that she married me.”\nFor a while Ronnie remained silent. Then he told me about his escape from Germany. He had been desperate when a group of young Germans offered to smuggle him across the Swiss border. They were conscientious objectors of the Nazi regime.\nFrom Basel he fled via Zürich to Paris and from there took a train to Marseilles. For a while he worked as a waiter. Before the defeat of France, he was lucky to get a berth in a vessel sailing to Haifa. After a while he moved to Tel Aviv and was engaged by Signon.\n“What became of these decent German?”\n“I don’t really know. But bear in mind that Adolf, may his name be cursed, did not tolerate dissenters. I suspect that my saviours ended up in concentration camps.”\n“I still fail to understand why you agreed to meet Hilda,” I told him. “She should have remained with you when the Nazis seized power.”\n“From her letter, I gleaned that she played a part in saving me. And, Chayim, one of those German fellows had mentioned her name and told me she had been working with them.”\nUsually, Ronnie’s face was composed; it became distorted. He was breathing hard and I knew he was fighting for self-control. When he calmed down, he told me that when he met Hilda his old emotions were rekindled. I suspected that, in reality, he had never freed himself from them. His first marriage was romantic. His second marriage was down to earth.\n“Chayim, Chayim, what did Hitler and his followers want from me? I was a good German citizen of the Jewish faith. I adored Goethe, Schiller and artists like Dürer. I loved to listen to Beethoven, Brahms and, yes, Wagner. And where was He? Why didn’t He step in; or couldn’t He care less?”\n“You know more than I about the rise and collapse of the Third Reich, Ronnie. And, please, leave God out of it. He has left our affairs to ourselves. The mess is ours; not His!”\nOnce again both of us remained silent. I knew how much my friend had suffered. I sympathized but was unable to comfort him. After a while I asked how he had felt when they met. Ronnie’s reply was muffled and incoherent. I noticed that he did not blame Hilda. In his eyes she, too, was a victim. She had done her utmost to save Ronnie and her son and throughout the war was employed by the Red Cross. She got their son’s details from Ronnie and intended to look him up.\n“Have your remained in contact with her?” I wanted to know.\n“Hilda decided against it,” Ronnie sobbed.\n“How did Galya react?”\n“She refused to meet Hilda; and I could understand her. She was aware that our marriage was a companionship. My marriage to Hilda was a romance. I knew that, like me, Hilda had aged. She was no longer the pretty young girl I had met in my university days; but she had retained her effervescent and caring personality.”\n“I wish I could be of help but, candidly, I am nonplussed.”\n“You could have a word with Galya. I fear she is going through a personality crisis. We go together to Signon every morning. Why don’t your call on her? I’ll pick you up for lunch.”\n“Tell her that I shall come tomorrow.”\nGalya looked calm. Behind this façade she was nervous and bewildered. She knew that Ronnie, her husband, kept thinking of Hilda. What was she to do? Before long she told me that she no longer required Ronnie’s assistance in rehearsing roles. In any event, she wanted to opt for early retirement as soon as Ronnie’s current contract expired.\n“I want to help him; but I don’t know how,” she told me. “He is an expert in his field and needs no assistance.”\n“I know, Galya. Ronnie is a born caregiver. He is not a caretaker and he might confuse assistance with condescension. Don’t you have any interest apart from acting?”\n“I would like to learn cooking. My skills are poor. Don’t you remember?”\n“I do. But look here: why don’t you learn cooking and ask Ronnie to help you to perfect the recipes. He would love that!”\n“It’s worth a try. It might induce him to think less about Hilda.”\nA few days later our family proceeded to Safed. When I told Yentl about Ronnie’s experience, she pointed out that episodes of this type were quite common. The Nazis had broken families and had separated children from their parents. In many cases it was difficult to find out whether a given individual had survived or perished.\n“We Jews resemble the Phoenix. Notwithstanding slaughters, pogroms, exiles and attempted genocides we remain an ethnic group. Families like my grandfather’s were driven out from Russia. Life there became intolerable. So they moved to the New World. And look how successful many of us have been.”\n“I take your point, Yentl. I only hope that our luck will not run out.”\n“He Himself makes sure our candle will burn forever!”\n“I agree,” I replied. “Still, many of us wonder why He hasn’t chosen some other people.”\nAfter some four weeks we returned to Brooklyn. During the next few years Rabbi Margalioth continued to delegate tasks to me. After a while I conducted not only our popular services of Shabbat morning but also the Kabalat-Shabbat conducted on Friday evenings. A year or two later Margalioth asked me to be in charge of the daily morning and evening services. He himself took a back seat.\nInitially, his moves puzzled me. Spiritually, he remained the leader and main organiser. It then dawned on me that for him too time did not stand still. He was now in his seventies and acting as cantor every day tired him out. I, too, was getting on. I was no longer the eager young man who had aspired for a role on the stage.\nIn due course, and at Rabbi Margalioth’s encouragement, I applied for and was granted American citizenship. The motivation was realistic. Travelling with an American passport was easier than with an Israeli one. In my heart of hearts, though, I remained an Israeli living in Brooklyn.\nBoth Ami and Ruth were growing. Shortly before we celebrated Ami’s sixteenth birthday, we had a lengthy chat about his future. My hope was that Ami, my only son, would join a Yeshiva. To my disappointment he wanted to go to college. He took the view that the curriculum in a Yeshiva was too narrow.\n“You’ll see me through Dad, won’t you?”\n“Of course, Ami. But don’t you want to dedicate your life to our religion?”\n“I don’t think so, Dad. My real interest is in computer technology. This sector is embryonic at this stage; but it is bound to prosper. I want to be with it.”\n“What are the achievements of this technology to date?”\n“A personal computer is already on the market; and two companies have developed a dedicated word processor. At present an instrument is costly. But, in due course, the personal computer will take over.”\n“Many innovators, Ami, go bust although their systems are good. An element of luck and of speculation is invariably involved.”\n“I hope to back the right horses, Dad. I really do; and I hope that Fortuna will smile.”\n“You do not refer to a ‘Guiding Hand’, son. Have you lost your faith?”\n“I haven’t. But religion and matters spiritual are not my vocation. I adhere to our tenets; and I do not think that any religion is superior to ours. Still, I am not mesmerized by it. My future lies in another, secular, domain. I have told you what it is.”\n“Every person has to chart his own course,” I told him, camouflaging my disappointment and speaking supportively. “You have made your decision and it goes without saying that you can rely on me. But tell me, Ami: are you an American Jew or an Israeli living in Brooklyn?”\n“I am an American, Dad. I grew up in this country. I enjoyed some splendid breaks in Safed and I am conversant in Hebrew. However, my real home is here.”\nSome two years later I had a similar conversation with my precocious daughter, Ruth. She told me that after finishing her secondary education she intended to spend a year or two in an Orthodox Kibbutz. One of her objects was to develop her Hebrew vocabulary.\n“After the spell in the Kibbutz, I want to enroll in a teachers’ training course, return to New York and find a teaching job in a Jewish school.”\n“Don’t you want to go to college?”\n“No, Dad, I am not the studious type. College is for youngsters who have set their heart on a professional career like law or medicine. I don’t have such aspirations. A teaching job is what I want.”\nI realised that she had made up her mind. Further, I sympathised and felt confident that, in due course, she would find a suitable spouse. The issue of building up a happy family was best discussed between mother and daughter.\nIn the years that followed, both Ami and Ruth spent their breaks with friends from their own respective age group. Yentl and I flew to Tel Aviv and proceeded to Safed on our own. On the first occasion our cottage appeared empty and lacking in life. Thereafter, we started to appreciate the ensuing privacy and, like many parents before us, realised that our children had grown up and were ready to embark on their own odysseys.\nTwo events that took place in those days remain fresh in my mind. The first occurred when we stopped for about a week in Tel Aviv. To my delight Ronnie Eyal and Galya invited us for dinner in their home. It was the first time Yentl met Galya and, I think, they liked one another. Galya prepared an excellent meal and Ronnie kept fussing over the dishes and took a lively interest in the cooking. It pleased me that both were happy and that harmony had been restored to their married life.\nThe second episode took place after we had proceeded to Safed. A middle-aged man I did not recognise approached me just as I was about to enter a synagogue.\n“Sir, you look like Chayim Rosenne: the officer in charge of my army unit.”\n“I’ve changed my name to Loeb Zohar and, yes, I am that very person. But I cannot really remember you.”\n“All of us have aged since then. I am Joseph Barad (nicknamed Yossi). A year ago I retired from practice. I was a psychiatrist.”\nWe proceeded to a nearby coffee house. It turned out that Yossi was familiar with my work as a faith healer. Smilingly, he confided that, in reality, he too had to resort to faith healing when a patient’s disorder was due to stress or edgy nerves.\nHe listened eagerly to some of the cases I had handled in Brooklyn. Then, spontaneously, I told him all about Ronnie, Galya and Hilda. Naturally, I used fictitious names but, by and large, adhered to the facts.\n“That shell shock and loss of memory business sounds odd,” he said after reflecting for a few minutes.\n“Why?”\n“It was a fashionable diagnosis after WWI. After WWII and the Vietnam War medicine postulated ‘temporary amnesia’. Today we know that a shock or an injury can lead to a partial loss of memory. Recovery from absolute amnesia, which can be occasioned by a stroke, is hard to cure; and I am unaware of successful cases.”\n“What do you think might have happened in this case?”\n“It is possible that Hilda met a ‘Mr. Right’ and then split.”\n“What, then, would induce her to reappear – to ‘rise from the grave’?”\n“I cannot come up with a definite answer. One possibility is that she wanted to meet her ex once again and see that he had not forgotten her. Another is a simple wish to re-visit the past with a view to regaining strength for her current existence.”\n“Both would also explain what made her decide to withdraw and veto further communications,” I agreed.\nYossi and I remained in touch ever since. Nowadays we often spend an evening together and reminiscence about our respective pasts.\n12. My Heydays as Rabbi My remaining years as Rabbi Margalioth’s second-in-command were pleasant. Our relationship was harmonious and usually we saw eye to eye. When we did not, I tended to bow to his authority unless I managed to convert him to my view. As time passed he became increasingly inclined to concede. It was also apparent that he was tiring easily. In due course, I became the main cantor, coordinator and, effectively, the lead person. Margalioth continued to attend all our functions but assumed the role of a supervisor, who governs from far afield.\nIn due course he told me that he felt the need to retire and asked me to become the new head of the congregation. I had my doubts. I knew that he was in his seventies but, even so, felt that that he could remain in office for a few more years.\n“I am happy the way things are,” I told him.\n“Many leaders make the mistake of outliving their utility. You are ready and have the ability. At this stage a changeover will be smooth. If we wait too long, you may see in-fighting and contention. I abhor these. I have made my choice a few years ago. I do not want to see it frustrated.”\n“Your advice is still needed, Rabbi. As you know, I often turn to you. It’s a privilege.”\n“You could still consult me if you felt the need. I intend to retire here: in Brooklyn.”\n“Don’t you want to settle in a place with a better climate?”\n“I prefer to remain in a town I know. We thought about Motza near Jerusalem. But my spoken Hebrew is not too fluent. Brooklyn is just right for me. Also, my family is here or in other districts of New York.”\nI agreed to take over. For about one year Moshe Margalioth continued as chairman of the Jewish Wellbeing Foundation. He then told me that Yentl was running it efficiently and that I was a suitable emissary. I had established sound contacts with our sponsors. On this basis, he concluded that it would be reasonable for him to step down. Reluctantly, I agreed. Before long the Foundation became known as the Loeb Zohar Foundation. However, Yentl and I adhered to the policies laid down by Moshe Margalioth. The Foundation remained a tolerant and, I believe, well managed organization.\nShortly after I took the Congregation over, the members of the Jewish and Israeli Culture Club invited me to become the chairman. They were familiar with the attainments of Uri’s club in Tel Aviv and with my contributions to it. I sensed that I ought to concentrate on the responsibilities involved in the Congregation. These did not leave me the time needed to guide and supervise the activities of any other body. However, I agreed to join the Club as a member and advisor.\nOne of the issues that arose related to the choice of a play to be performed under the Club’s auspices. King Solomon and Shalmai the Cobbler, Tevyeh the Milkman and some dramas by Israeli playwrights were considered. Then one member referred to an English piece entitled A Pack of Lies. I had actually seen it in the Lyric in London’s West End in 1983. The play deals with a middle-class couple who befriend their neighbours, assuming them to be run of the mill characters. The couple is upset when a plain clothes detective asks them to observe the activities of these neighbours because they are members of a spy ring that passes confidential military secrets to a foreign government. The couple, played by Judy Dench and Michael Williams, face the dilemma of split loyalties. On the one hand, they are fond of their neighbours but, on the other hand, are good citizens. In the event, the couple enables the squad to use their house for counter espionage. The play ends with the arrest of the spies, whose real surname is Cohen.\n“Why is this play topical?” asked another member.\n“It is actually reminiscent of the 1951 episode involving Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who disclosed American privileged information to the Soviet Union. They were apprehended and executed. President Eisenhower refused to grant a pardon.”\n“But the Rosenberg’s were motivated by their ideology,” I stepped in.\n“True. But suppose they had to choose between loyalty to family members who had remained in the Soviet Union and the welfare of their new home: the United States?”\n“This is not a new issue,” interceded a third member. “During WWI German Jews were directed to enlist and fight French armies comprising Jews …”\n“ … and vice versa,” pointed out another. “And during WWII Japanese migrants had to decide whether they owed loyalty to their new abode or side with their original homeland.”\n“And let us not forget the despicable Lavon Affair of 1954 in which Egyptian Jews were induced to support an Israeli scheme that was counter to Egypt’s interests,” added yet another member. “The problem of split loyalties is always current. In WWII ethnic Australians of Italian origin fought against Italian troops in North Africa.”\n“I agree. But A Pack of Lies would have to be adapted. We need a modified version. In reality, we have to write a new play with a different emphasis,” I averred.\nTwo members of the Club volunteered to give the project a try. After some four months, they produced a drama set in the United States. It dealt with an American Jewish couple who faced the Hobson’s choice of either acting as spies for the country from which they had migrated or remain loyal to their new home. The authorities in their erstwhile home pressurized them to cooperate by means of threats as to what would be done to their relatives who had stayed behind. The motto of the drama was that, when a new country opens its doors to migrants, the newcomers’ loyalty is owed to their new host.\nThe play was well attended but the critique was lukewarm. The reviewers were disappointed with the performance. It has to be conceded that the staging and acting were mediocre. A good director had been required but, regrettably, was not found.\nIn contrast, most critics saw the relevance of the issue elaborated, namely the well-known problems faced by migrants. The drama did not purport to provide an answer. The audience had to decide how people ought to conduct themselves when facing such a predicament.\nOnly one critic took the view that this question should not be raised in a play. I disagreed. The mass immigration to Europe and North America from China and Middle Eastern countries had exacerbated this issue in our own era, especially as migrants had tended to congregate in select places and were inclined to adhere to their ethnic norms. Undoubtedly, the issue furnished a proper topic for research papers and theses authored by anthropologists. For the common person, a play was more accessible. Further, I was convinced that our presentation was unbiased. On this point I was reassured by my friend, Uri Barsel, who attended one of the performances.\nA few days after the last performance, Uri took me out for lunch. It saddened me to see that the young lad, who had looked so fresh and full of life in Tichon, appeared haggard and lacklustre and, to my dismay, was bloated and overweight.\nInitially we spoke about the play. Uri told me he sensed that the performance was not up to my standard. The topic, though, was relevant. He took the view that the drama should be translated to Hebrew and performed in Tel Aviv. I voiced my consent.\nWhen we were served the main courses, I asked why he looked so glum. He told me that his medical tests suggested that he was a latent diabetic. He could prevent the onset of the disease by watching his diet. Regrettably, his occupation rendered this impossible.\n“You see, Loeb,” he explained, “when I attend a business lunch or dinner I have to partake. I eat and drink too much in the course of business. Sooner or later I’ll have to start taking tablets. The very idea is hateful!”\n“In the very least you could exercise.”\n“That’s more easily said than done. I simply don’t have the time.”\nI looked at him with dismay. He was paying dearly for his successful career. I knew it was futile to suggest early retirement. His offspring were in their late teens and so he still had to cope with the expenditure of their education. If he had been a believer, he might have found solace in faith. His agnosticism denied him such comfort.\n“But look here, Uri,” I ventured, “couldn’t Rina, your wife, work for a few years so that you build up a handsome package for early retirement?”\n“She got used to her role as housewife. I do not want to bring pressure on her.”\n“Is she aware of your quandary?”\n“I haven’t told her about it. You see, Loeb, her happiness and comfort are my first priority. I’ll have to continue to try to control my eating and drinking. It is the only sensible solution.”\n“So here is your own issue of split loyalty or, rather, interests. Her happiness overrides your health issue.”\n“I know,” he sighed.\n“All I can do is to wish you good luck and say a blessing.”\nWhen I met Uri again after some two years he had lost weight and regained his vigor. He appeared positive notwithstanding his having to take a tablet before the dishes arrived.\n“You see, Loeb, when I told Rina about my sticky situation, she decided to join the working force. She also encouraged me to take pills and be open about my condition. Nowadays I take less starch and drink very little. I do feel better. Further, we are now a two-income family and so I shall be able to opt for early retirement.”\n“Oh well,” I told him, “it appears that Rina too has her priorities. Your well-being is more important to her than her own comforts. She is a good wife; and you are a lucky man.”\n“I know,” he consented.\nOnce again, I have jumped the gun and so turn back to our play in Brooklyn. A few weeks after the last performance, Rabbi Margalioth invited Yentl and me for a Shabbat Eve meal. Usually, I hosted such a meal in the synagogue every Friday evening but, on this occasion, my recently appointed deputy took over and so Yentl and I went over to Margalioth’s home.\nTo my surprise Rabbi Mendel Schulman was also a guest. When we finished saying our prayers, our conversation turned to the drama. Schulman was critical of the staging and the acting but, to my surprise, praised our choice of subject. He thought that the ad-hoc playwrights had done well and induced the audience to think about the question of split loyalties.\n“But you know this type of problem crops up in our personal lives more often than we expect.”\n“What to do you mean, Mendel’e?” asked Rabbi Margalioth.\n“I had to face this type of problem a few years ago, Moyshe. As you know, my only son left the fold and became a Roman Catholic!”\n“I know, Mendel’e,” replied my mentor. “But how does this involve the split loyalty issue?”\n“That rascal had to decide whether to respect his father’s orientation or follow the commands of his own religious conviction. And I, Mendel Schulman, had to decide whether to adhere to strict dogma and sever relations with him or close my eyes. My strict adherence to our tenets prevailed over my paternal commitment to my son.”\n“I wouldn’t have disowned him,” observed Margalioth.\n“Neither would I,” I voiced my agreement. “My own brother married out; but I have remained in touch with him notwithstanding my mortification.”\n“I am not surprised, Loeb,” countered Schulman. “Your motto is tolerance; mine is strict observance. When all is said and done, I had no choice.”\n“What is the correct course if the split loyalty arises with respect of political or secular ideological matters, for instance, if you have to decide whether or not to enlist in an army that may fight another one, which also comprises brothers in faith?”\n“Actually, our tradition provides an answer: ‘the law of the Kingdom is binding’. Usually this principle furnishes a clear answer.”\n“Is this principle easy to apply?” asked Margalioth. I, in turn, thought it best to keep silent.\n“It is not,” conceded Schulman. “Still, it speaks for itself.”\nFor the remaining half hour or so, we sang the appropriate Shabbat songs. After the occasion came to its close, I offered to give Rabbi Schulman a lift to his hotel. Initially, he looked perturbed and so I explained that the taxi ride had been prepaid before Shabbat Eve and that the driver was a gentile.\n“A Shabbat Goy,” smiled Mendel Schulman and accepted.\n“Indeed,” I assured him. “Neither Rabbi Margalioth nor I would call a taxi and pay the fare on a Shabbat; nor would we accept a ride from a fellow Jew, who is not allowed to carry out any work on Shabbat.”\nWhen we arrived at home, after dropping Rabbi Schulman in front of his hotel, Yentl expressed support for his unease. As Schulman was familiar with my tolerant approach, his foreboding was understandable.\n“You, Loeb, are closer to tolerant agnostics than to narrow-minded disciplinarians like Mendel Schulman.”\n“You may be right, Yentl,” I replied after thinking her words over, “but in certain situations every person has to take a stand. For instance, if I saw a person attacking a hapless child, I would step in and save the victim. In certain cases, there is no room for tolerance: it becomes callousness. You say to yourself: ‘I couldn’t care less’ but, at the very same time, you know that you ought to mind. The difference between Mendel Schulman’s orientation and mine is in that he is rigid even in instances in which I would shrug my shoulders. The difference relates to the borderline; not to the essence.”\nAnother difficult issue came to my attention on one of my visits to Tel Aviv. After looking up Ronnie and Galya, who were by then semi-retired, I called on Shosh. I knew that her marriage was problematic but that neither she nor Uzi sought a divorce. Shosh was aware that Uzi had been unfaithful and opted for sweet revenge, except that, in her case, this did not involve affairs. She simply ate to her heart’s delight. In the process, she became obese and developed a triple chin. From a heavy-set yet attractive young girl, she metamorphosed into a middle-aged matron void of any physical charm. Odd to say, she took Uzi’s escapade in her stride and did not speak ill of him.\nShosh had made a habit of taking ‘a small bite’ of the dishes ordered by her hosts. I, in turn, came early when we had a lunch or dinner appointment and took the precaution of ordering a dish before her arrival. On the occasion I am going to relate, Shosh was in poor spirit and hardly touched her own food.\n“Why are you so glum today, Shosh?”\n“I don’t feel like eating. I have bad news; and I don’t know what to do. I need your advice, Pilkin,” she wailed, using my old nickname instead of ‘Loeb’.\n“Well, what is the matter? I’ll do my best to help you sort things out.”\n“I am not sure you can this time!”\nShe then told me that her first born, Avner, was going steady with Dina, Uzi’s daughter by the other woman. The affair had been going on for a while and Shosh was at a loss. She simply did not know what to do.\n“Do they know that they are half-brother and sister?” I asked when the enormity of the situation dawned on me.\n“I am not sure,” she conceded. “You see, my Avner knows that his father sees another woman but I suspect no further facts.”\n“Is it certain that Avner’s girl-friend, Dina, is Uzi daughter?”\n“It is. You see, Uzi met Dina’s mother some two years after her divorce.”\n“Does Uzi know about the relationship of Avner and Dina? Have you discussed the situation with him?”\n“It is not easy for me. Uzi is aware of my knowledge of his second family; but we have never discussed this openly. He has gleaned that I do not care!”\n“But this is a serious matter. In our religion, a union of Avner and Dina is proscribed. The principle is clear (Lev. 18:9; 20:17) and, of course, a Rabbi cannot celebrate a marriage which is incestuous. You have to apprise Avner of the facts.”\n“I don’t know how to tackle the subject,” said Shosh and, out of habit, gobbled a ‘small bite’ of my goose.\nFor a while both of us were immersed in thoughts. Shosh deliberated on the possible approaches to the crisis. The full details would come to Avner as a shock.\n“It is a thorny problem,” explained Shosh. “You see, Uzi’s girl friend – or ‘second wife’ – is, as I told you, a divorcee. Her ex-husband pays her alimony. However, under the terms of their separation agreement, his obligation terminates if she re-marries or enters into a ‘permanent union’. This motivated Uzi and me not to talk about it openly. We did not even mention it to offspring. You do understand?”\n“I do. It explains your silence. If the ‘ex’ ceases to pay alimony, the burden falls on Uzi.”\nThe situation was now clear. My real problem, though, related to a different question, which centred on the treatment of a child born from a consanguineous union. The hapless newborn would be deemed a ‘mamzer’. Whilst the parents’ penalty was ‘expiration at the hands of heaven’ the child was precluded from celebrating a Jewish marriage. In a sense, the sin of the parents was visited on their offspring. Observing me intently and having read my thoughts, Shosh asked:\n“Surely, the child is blameless. Why should he or she be penalized?”\n“Under our tradition the child is a mamzer!”\n“I thought the word refers to an illegitimate child?”\n“In modern Hebrew it does. In Hebrew slang it may also refer to a tricky or unscrupulous individual. I recall how a chap in Tichon, who invariably reneged on promises, was called ‘that mamzer’.”\n“And isn’t such a person a pariah?”\n“In Jewish law a mamzer is an outcast. He (or she) ‘shall not enter the congregation of the Lord’ (Deut. 23:3). His parents, in contrast, are not excommunicated, although they are the transgressors. And, as you know, in our modern world an illegitimate child, whom we often call a ‘bastard’, is not an outsider. I can think about a number of celebrities who were highly regarded for their achievements notwithstanding their illegitimacy.”\n“So why this harsh treatment of a mamzer in our law?”\n“I am not sure; but look, Shosh, incest is proscribed in many societies and religions (including Christianity). I suspect that the danger of consanguineous unions was noted in antiquity and confirmed by instances that occurred in later periods. Just think about Henry de Toulouse-Lautrec, whose parents were first cousins: his legs did not mend after he broke them as a child. And think what intermarriage did to the royal families: the defective Habsburg chin and the horrors of hereditary hemophilia. Perhaps a mamzer was made an outcast in order to prevent his defective heredity-features, known as genes today, from spreading. It is also possible that the main object was to deter people from engaging in incest.”\n“I know,” Shosh retorted. While she remained immersed in her thoughts, I managed to finish my meal without her gulping the tastiest morsels. As I wiped my mouth, she finally addressed me again:\n“You are right: I know. But what on earth should I do?”\n“You or your Uzi – that ‘worthy’ – must apprise Avner or Dina. There is no other way out!”\nWhen I lunched with Shosh during my next visit to Israel, she was again her good old self: ravenously she devoured the lion share of my meal and looked as happy as ever. I, in turn, had filled my stomach largely by consuming bread rolls. After gossiping about old friends and relatives, I assumed the courage to ask about Avner and Dina. To my relief she told me that, in the end, Uzi disclosed the relevant facts to Avner. The latter, who had been unaware that Dina was his half-sister, was distraught. When he recovered, he advised Dina.\n“They were deeply in love,” observed Shosh. “Initially, Dina suggested that they live together, practice birth control and consider adopting a child. Later on Dina concluded that it would be best if they split but remained good platonic friends. She wanted to have children.”\n“Where had they met originally?”\n“Both are keen on classical music; they inherited this passion from Uzi. They attended a conservatory and actually played chamber music together. I believe they still do. Surely, this is not proscribed by our sages?!”\nA few years later I discussed this issue with Bushi, my agnostic boyhood friend, when we reunited in Zermatt. To my surprise he doubted that the consanguinity laws applied during the period covered in the Old Testament. In his opinion the proscription was post exilic, which means that it was instituted after the destruction of Jerusalem by the King Nebuchadnezzar in 587 BC. So were most texts illuminating Jewish Law. In contrast, in the ancient Song of Solomon (Song. 4:9,12) the lover refers to his beloved as “my sister, my bride”. She, in turn, says to him: “Oh that you wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my Mother” (Song. 8:1). Bushi also referred to the illicit affair of Amnon and Tamar (Sam.II. 13:1-12), both of whom were fathered by King David. I had to agree that, in reality, many Jewish laws ante-dated the Babylonian exile. Still, I believed in our faith and traditions.\n“Look here, Bushi, you use information selectively. You cast doubts on the historicity of the Pentateuch (the Torah) and then use select texts of the very same source – the Masoretic Text of the Old Testament – to cast doubts on a law prescribed in it. Surely, this is inconsistent!”\n“I am simply trying to read between the lines,” he retorted defensively.\n“I understand; but, then, don’t you realise that your glasses are tainted?”\nBushi was not the only person with whom I discussed this thorny issue. During my life as a retiree in Safed I talked about it with Yossi (Joseph Barad) who had spent most of his life as a psychiatrist. His analysis of the laws in point related to the psychological and sociological issues involved. He took the view that once society learnt from experience the hazards of in-breeding, it developed the prohibition of incestuous unions. He further opined that our draconian laws in point were triggered by the customary taboos of the day. He may, of course, be right. From my perspective, though, the existence of the law in point was an adequate basis for its binding effect. A view similar to mine was taken by Rabbi Moshe Margalioth, with whom I discussed the issue in Brooklyn. He insisted that this was one of the instances in which it was necessary to apply the law even if you disapproved of it.\nMargalioth guided me also in respect of an issue that arose in our congregation in Brooklyn. After Margalioth’s retirement, when the mantle of leadership rested on my shoulders, I sensed the need of grooming a successor. Time had not stood still and slowly but surely the daily occupation entailed by my office became burdensome. Frequently I asked one of our students to lead some of the prayers and delegated duties arising in respect of the services.\nThen, to my disappointment, the very fellow I had been grooming, Gideon Harris, advised me that he decided to leave us and accepted a post offered to him by a bank in Manhattan.\n“Is it tenure?” I wanted to know.\n“Not really. It is a probationary contract. If they are pleased with my services it will be followed by a permanent posting. I have decided to take the risk.”\n“You have a bright future with us! Don’t you know this?”\n“I do. But think about the salary offered by Wall Street banks. What I get here is less than one half of it.”\n“I can imagine this. But how about job satisfaction? Aren’t you proud to be a guide to members of our congregation?”\n“It is a question of priorities.”\n“So you prefer the sixpence to the moon,” I muttered. “Still the matter is up to you. All I can do is to wish you success and happiness.”\n“One day I may become a sponsor. Surely you won’t turn me down.”\nWhen I told Margalioth about this unfortunate development, he took a relaxed attitude. He thought that, all in all, it was better if a student left before his ordination and the assumption of a religious career.\n“He did not leave us in a lurch. All you have to do is to find a substitute. Many of our students would be happy to take his place. Ours is a moderate and tolerant organisation; and it is a renowned Yeshiva. Every year the number of applicants goes up. So does the number of our sponsors.\n“But what shall I do if I have to retire before a suitable candidate emerges?”\n“How old are you, Loeb?”\n“I’ll soon be 63 years of age.”\n“Quite young. You ought to carry on until you find a replacement. Actually, you don’t have to pick just one chap. Keep an open mind.”\nGideon’s departure was followed by another disappointment. Ami, who had finished college and was looking for a suitable niche, rang to tell me that he was coming over for a visit. I raised my eyebrows. Usually, Ami turned up unannounced. Placing a call to ensure I would be available suggested that something was on his mind. Yentl, too, was surprised. She wondered whether Ami needed money.\nIt turned out that Ami came over to talk about a very different matter: he had decided to marry Mary, a girl he knew from college. He told us that she was not of our creed. Initially, I felt chagrin. Then I managed to overcome this reaction. Ami was a grown up man and had the right to plan his future.\nAmi added that they had decided to have their wedding in Chicago, where Mary’s parents lived. Yentl nodded supportively but came to a halt when Ami announced the date they had fixed. It was two days before Yom Kippur – the holiest day in our religion, which takes place ten days after the Jewish New Year Eve. I had agreed to fly over so as to lead the prayers in the Schul in Tel Aviv.\n“I am flying to Israel a few days before Rosh Hashanah and do not intend to return to Brooklyn until well after the day you have chosen,” I told him.\n“Do you really have to fly to Tel Aviv every year?”\n“Even if I stayed here, I would spend the days preceding the high holidays in the synagogue. Can’t you postpone you wedding ceremony until they are over?”\n“I am afraid I cannot. You see, Mary is pregnant and so we want to get married as early as possible.”\n“Why don’t you get married before we leave Brooklyn?” asked Yentl.\n“Mary’s father is away on a business trip. The ceremony it to take place one day after he returns to the States. Please understand me.”\n“We do,” I told him and, ignoring Yentl’s anxious expression, added: “To us the high holidays, especially Yom Kippur, matter. You know this, Ami!”\n“I know,” he conceded. “But, then, what can I do?”\n“Ask Mary’s father to change his travelling schedule!”\n“I’ll ask Mary to talk to him.”\nMary’s father was amenable and so the wedding date was brought forward. Mary and Ami opted for a civil marriage to be followed by a festive gathering. Her parents and we undertook to share the expense involved. To avoid embarrassment, I wore an ordinary suit and, at Yentl’s prompting, a colourful skullcap instead of a hat.\nIt was a pleasant function. Yentl and Mary had a lengthy chat during the party and I sensed that they would get on. I shook the newlyweds’ hands but had little to say. Unlike Yentl, I was unable to hide my disappointment. Ami sensed it.\n“Have I hurt you by marrying out, Dad?”\n“No, Ami, you are of age; and so you are entitled to plan your own future.”\n“So you do not propose to disown me?”\n“Of course not. You are my only son.”\n“Mary and I have paid a deposit on a house in Los Angeles. We intend to go into business there. Mom and you will visit us; won’t you?”\n“Whenever work permits. And, as you know, we hope to retire in Safed. By then the newborn will be able to take a long flight. We should be pleased if you came to visit us there.”\nDuring our trip back to New York, Yentl looked at me thoughtfully. She knew I was gloomy. Seeking to cheer me up, she observed:\n“I do intend to visit them frequently. Their baby will be our first grandchild. His birth means a lot to me. And how about you? Aren’t you pleased?”\n“I would have been happier if my grandchild was Jewish.”\n“Tevyeh’s world is no longer authentic. Stop playing his role in real life. Ami is bringing our grandchildren into the world. We should feel privileged and elated.”\n“You may be right, but it makes me sad to think that the number of American Jews is dwindling. I hope Ami and Mary will have two or perhaps even four children. Still, none of them will speak Hebrew or attend a synagogue!”\n“Doesn’t this apply to many secular Jews?”\n“Perhaps it does; but, then, ethnically they remain within the fold. My grandchildren will be brought up in a milieu alien to me,” I grumbled.\n“True! All the same, they will be your descendants!”\nWhen we returned to New York after the Jewish high holiday season, I started to look for a replacement for Gideon. None of our existing Yeshiva students appeared suitable. There were a number of promising applications for admission but I was aware that the financial world would, in due course, snap up the best graduates. We were not in a position to compete.\nAs usual, we had a number of applications from traditional Israeli boys. But in their case, too, experience dictated caution. Some were likely to use their entrance to the Yeshiva as a stepping stone to Wall Street. My object was to spot a candidate who would remain with us and eventually might take over.\nAs was my practice, I examined each application carefully. In the course of this perusal I saw that one hopeful’s name was Avner Shamir, Shosh’s son. Having short listed him, I arranged an interview during my next trip to Israel (just before the Passover Week, which fell at the beginning of April).\nAll in all, our shortlist comprised three applicants. The first turned out to have an interest in computers. It soon dawned on me that after spending some time in our Yeshiva he would in all probability join a commercial firm. I had to rule him out. The second was not just observant but also a fanatic. I concluded that a Yeshiva associated with Rabbi Schulman would be more suitable and directed him to it.\nI then interviewed Avner. He was a tall, well-built, broad-shouldered and intelligent-looking youth. His bright and keen looking eyes spoke for themselves. From the very start I liked him. His replies too were to the point:\n“I can, of course, continue to study law. I am about to complete my third year in the Hebrew University,” he told me.\n“What then do we have to offer you? Why are you interested in a religious career?”\n“A platform for forming my ideas about religion.”\n“With a view to reform?”\n“Not necessarily. I’ll have to start studying the background and the philosophical writings of Judaism.”\n“How good is your knowledge of the Tanakh (the ‘Old Testament’) and the Talmud?”\n“Not too bad. We studied the Old Testament in my secondary school – TA.1 – and I covered Talmud and Family Law in the University.”\n“Why didn’t you enroll in a Yeshiva straight after TA.1? Incidentally, I too went to this school. I attended the same Form as your mother.”\n“I know. My personal experience awakened my interest in our religion; this is latent.”\n“Your mother told me all about your dilemma. But, look: our course takes five years. And why did you opt for our Yeshiva?”\n“Yours has the reputation of being liberal. And I hope I’ll be given some cross credits for the relevant courses.”\n“I’ll do my best; you’ll hear from me.”\nBack in New York, I consulted Rabbi Margalioth. He listened attentively and, after some reflection, expressed his support. He added that from his point of view the Hidden Hand of the Almighty directed Avner to our Yeshiva.\n“Rabbi, don’t you think all this could be a chain of coincidences?”\n“This is one possible explanation. Many agnostics resort to it when they face what we consider a miracle. There is, of course, no clear-cut answer: you have to pick a choice. As you know, I have done so years ago. And you?”\n“I am not as confident as you.”\n“So you have your doubts!”\nTo my consternation, Margalioth broke into a fit of coughing. Looking him over carefully, I noted that he had lost weight and appeared tired and frail. In response to my enquiry, he assured me that he was well and fit.\n“I am just not as young and as active as I used to be. Time does not stand still for anybody. The main thing is: I have found a successor!”\n“I only hope he is of the right calibre,” I replied.\n“Time will tell,” he concluded.\nAvner was a real asset. Initially, he was asked to study for four years. His impressive results and amicable orientation enabled us to ‘jump’ him one year. Then, after three years with us, he was ready to be ordained. Shortly thereafter I asked him to become my deputy.\nIn reality, I was aging and getting ready to retire. The lengthy prayer sessions and the endless meetings with our sponsors took their toll. I was beginning to find my routine cumbersome and dull. Still, it was important for me to leave our Yeshiva in good hands. Accordingly, I started to delegate to Avner some of my functions. Yentl cooperated by getting him involved with the daily running of the Foundation. I believe that she, too, was looking forward to moving to our cottage in Safed.\nNowadays, when I live in Safed on my own, I dare to believe that He sent Avner to us. I knew that Avner’s new career gave him satisfaction. To me, his arrival provided the opportunity to leave the scene before I outstayed my welcome.\nShortly before his ordination, I asked Avner to accompany me to a meeting of the Jewish and Israeli Culture Club, which proposed to organise the performance of a further play.\nDifferent dramas were considered but dismissed either as too difficult or as not being topical. Then one of the girls suggested we stage Saint-Saën’s Samson and Delilah. The opera, based on the biblical narrative (Judges, 16:4-30), tells how Samson, the Danite Chieftain, was betrayed by the enticing Delilah. At the request of the Rulers of the Philistines she nagged him to disclose to her the secret of his prowess and revealed this secret information for a reward. Samson was defeated, captured and blinded; but, when he regained his strength, he took hold of the two central pillars of the palace in which he was displayed for the mockery of those in attendance. He pressed these apart with all his strength and so the building collapsed on him and on his tormentors. The Bible tells us that, in this manner, Samson killed more of his enemies when he died than during his lifetime.\nThe opera was topical because Delilah has to make a choice between her love for Samson and her loyalty to her people. Further, although Saint-Saën’s libretto depicts her as a beguiling woman, she declines the reward.\nI sensed that, notwithstanding the relevance of the play, many of those in attendance felt uncertain. Before long, all eyes focused on me.\n“Can we really manage to put it on?” I wanted to know.\n“Why ever not?” asked the Chairman, a middle-aged and portly banker.\n“Staging it is ambitious! Do we have good singers?” I asked.\n“And the performance requires the participation of a substantial choir!” added Avner.\n“Can’t we replace it by a single singer?” asked the Chairman.\n“Not in the case of this opera,” opined another girl. “And we must avoid getting negative reviews.”\n“True,” agreed the Chairman. “May some other play be more suitable?”\n“Why don’t we revive Lessing’s Nathan the Wise? It is easier to stage and I find it topical,” I told them. Noting that many looked bewildered, I queried: “Is anybody familiar with it?”\n“I’ve skimmed through it some time ago,” volunteered Marit, a widely read and intellectually curious journalist.\n“Why don’t you enlighten people like me, who have never heard of it?” asked the Chairman.\n“Lessing wrote the play at the end of 18th century. It relates how, after having defeated the Crusaders, Saladin sets one knight free. He, in turn, saves Rachel – Nathan’s daughter – when the family’s house burns down. When Nathan returns from his business trip, he wants to reward the hero. The latter falls in love with Rachel … and so on.”\n“Why is this drama relevant in our era?” asked one of the members.\n“The climax of the drama is the allegory of the rings, which Nathan relates to Saladin when asked which of the three monotheistic religions is the true one. The parable tells the story of a father, who has in his possession a ring which is the family’s heirloom and which he ought to leave to the son he loves most. As he loves his three sons equally, he asks a goldsmith to make two replicas of the original. Each heir believes he has the original. In reality, the rings have an equal value.”\n“But why is this tale relevant nowadays?” queried the Chairman.\n“Lessing’s object was to suggest that each of the three religions is valid.”\n“I am still in the dark,” insisted the Chairman.\n“It is topical,” I insisted. “While we are not concerned with the validity of other religions, our faith – Judaism – has many sects. Nathan tells us that the genuine motto is tolerance. We have to agree to disagree in a peaceful – and hence non-fanatical – manner.”\n“We may have to update the text so as to clarify this maxim. And we have to do so without treading on any toes. I think we should go ahead,” concluded the Chairman. All present nodded their approval.\nThe Chairman volunteered to take on the role of Nathan. One of our girls was persuaded to play the daughter and a young lad took on the mantle of the good Samaritan. As nobody was keen to play Saladin, I suggested to the Chairman that we invite Avner.\nAs we departed, Avner told me that he and Dina had contemplated composing an opera based on Nathan the Wise. The project was abandoned when they had to part.\n“You must put the past behind you, Avner.”\n“It will be difficult for me to find another girl. Dina and I were just right for one another.\n“I understand. The two of you came from strikingly similar backgrounds. And both of you inherited a passion for classical music. But the time has come to look elsewhere!”\n“I hear you, Rabbi Zohar; and thanks for your concern.”\nOur performance of Nathan the Wise was praised by everybody. It had a favourable review in Jewish periodicals and, actually, our team was invited to stage it in Philadelphia and Chicago. There too it was lauded. Our motto of tolerance was, I believe, in accord with contemporary sentiment.\n13. The End of my Brooklyn Days My remaining years as a Rabbi in Brooklyn were unadventurous. I was, of course, no longer part of the militia in Israel and so was able to spend at least six weeks per year in Safed and another two or three in Tel Aviv, where I attended our synagogue. Many doors that were closed to me in my youth opened themselves. In a sense, all I had to say was: ‘open Sesame’. As Chayim Rosenberg (or Rosenne) I was a mere (and often unwanted) supplicant; as Rabbi Zohar my name became well-known.\nI should have been proud of my success. In reality, though, I was getting fed up. The need of regularly leading a congregation and tending to the needy or unhealthy members of the community became a strain. I was aging. My immune system, which was good during my heydays, became impaired. Occasionally, I picked up an infection when I visited sick parishioners. Often I became impatient when they listed their symptoms or wailed.\nFrom a mere place of rest, our cottage in Safed metamorphosed into a haven. I craved to live there in peace – far away from the issues that were troubling others. Yentl, who kept observing me, encouraged me to prolong the time we spent in Israel.\nOn one such visit I looked up Shosh. To my surprise, she looked – once again – gloomy and downcast. Worse still, her appetite had vanished and she had lost weight. I realised that something was troubling her. By the time our main courses were served, I asked what was wrong. Initially, she claimed that all was well. Still, her deflated expression gave the lie to her words. I realised that she wanted to clam up. Nevertheless, I decided to prod.\n*“Shosh, you are not yourself today. What is wrong? As you know, Avner is now in Brooklyn. I am sure he will soon be ready to take over. You have every reason to be proud of him and of his success. But what shall I tell him when he asks about you?”\n“Tell him I am my usual happy self!”\n“That would be a lie! I know something is on your mind.”\n“Well, it’s about Uzi …”\n“… don’t tell me he has started a third household,” I stepped in.\n“I wish he could. That won’t bother me!”\n“So what is it?”\n“Uzi is a very sick man, Pilkin. He has leukemia. I wanted to look after him. It is the least I could do. But he is being nursed by Penina.”\n“Penina?”\n“The other woman. He is coming over to our place from time to time; but she is the principal caregiver.”\nI understood her anxiety. In more than one way, this was a final act of rejection. Shosh had accepted Uzi’s infidelity. She managed to close her eyes and even claimed that his philandering saved her back breaking work. She continued to believe that, all in all, he had remained her man. When he fell ill and sought help elsewhere, she realised that she had lost him once and for all.\n“Did you inform Avner? He has the right to know!”\n“I couldn’t make myself. You see, Pilkin, Avner always loved Uzi more than me. I had the burden of bringing Avner up. Uzi took him to watch soccer matches and played table tennis with him. I was the one to fret if Avner’s grades in school were lower than we had expected. I spoke to the teachers and, when Avner was unwell, I took him to the doctor. I really think that this last burden – the task of telling Avner that his father is beyond hope – is to be borne by Uzi himself.”\n“Are you certain that Uzi’s caretaker is Penina?”\n“Yes, I am sure. You see: when I realized that Uzi was ailing, I swallowed my pride and went to his ‘other’ home. Uzi was embarrassed and left the room. I had a long chat with Penina. I think she is, actually, a very nice person. Until Avner met Dina, Penina didn’t realise that Uzi already had a family. The revelation came to her as a shock.”\n“Good grief: your Uzi is a real scoundrel! Isn’t he?”\n“He is, rather. But, then, what should I do now? What is the proper thing to do?”\n“Avner must be told. I am surprised that Dina didn’t tell him. Surely, she knows.”\n“She is aware of Uzi’s condition; but she is not in touch with Avner.”\nFor a while, I was just as lost as Shosh. The position was awkward and Avner’s erstwhile romance with Dina exacerbated the situation. My training and life experience as a religious leader did not provide an answer. Then I recalled the motto that often stood me in good stead in the remote past, when I had hired out my services as an odd jobs boy: if a situation became unacceptable, you had to change the fundamentals. Thus, if you could not stop the leak from a defective pipe, you had to divert the water until you found a spare part and had the time to install it.\n“Look here, Shosh: do you think that Penina is able to carry on until the end?”\n“I doubt it. When I called on her, she struck me as exhausted.”\n“Well, in that case you better convince her that Uzi ought to be moved to a care facility. You can then advise Avner without reopening a wound.”\n“It may be the answer. I’ll try.”\nA few weeks later Uzi moved to a nursing home. After another six months he passed away. Avner flew to Israel as soon as he was told. To date, I wonder whether he had a heart to heart talk with his father. Avner never discussed Uzi’s demise with me.\nShortly after Avner’s return to Brooklyn following Uzi’s funeral, I decided to fly to Europe so as to keep the rendezvous with Bushi. When we traveled to Zermatt, forty years earlier, both of us were young men. We dreamt about the future, had ambitious plans and were full of hope. We had not met since Bushi left Israel for the pursuit of further studies in Oxford. For me it was easy to keep track of his progress. From mutual friends I gleaned that he had been appointed to a junior post in Singapore but rose through the ranks. He had married a Chinese girl and lived in a house provided by his employers. In 1966, he moved to Wellington to take up an appointment to a full professorship. He and his wife spent eleven years in New Zealand. He then took up a professorship at Monash University in Melbourne. I was aware that, although his marriage was barren and unhappy, he decided to stick it out. In 1986, his wife persuaded him to return to Singapore. There, too, he excelled in his job but his personal life remained awkward. I suspected that, as he had always been a loner, he would have failed to make new friends. Occasionally, he rang one of our classmates, Amnon, who had risen high in Israel’s legal service. I also knew that Bushi was trying to obtain information about my progress. I swore Amnon to secrecy and trusted that my change of name secured my anonymity. Bushi may have heard about the tolerant Rabbi Loeb Zohar. He was not aware that this aging sage was none other than his old bosom pal, Pilkin.\nOn my flight to Zürich I kept meandering on the vagaries of fate. Bushi would have expected me to be an aging actor residing in Tel Aviv. He knew that I had been engaged by the ITV which was bound to send me on missions. In consequence, the scribbled postcards I sent him as I was travelling on behalf of the Congregation would not have come to him as a surprise or as an eye opener. The absence of an address for return mail might have irked him. Still, I knew my Bushi well and so was certain that he was going to keep our appointment. As a matter of extra caution, I sent him a reminder, emphasizing that, as agreed, I would book a table in his name.\nBushi’s odyssey was remarkable. Despite our seminal conversation during our first trip to Zermatt I hoped that he would eventually settle down as a legal practitioner in Tel Aviv. I was not surprised by his decision to enroll for further studies overseas but thought that, at least for a while, he would return home. His having become yet another Diaspora Jew saddened me. I knew that he could have discarded the wanderer’s staff at any time. Bushi, though, was tenacious. Once he opted for a career in academia, he would be guided by the principle that my home is where I am comfortable. All in all, he had always been an odd man out. So, in effect, he had remained true to character.\nI suspected that Bushi had retained his worldly outlook. He was – and had remained – an agnostic. In contrast, I was a moderate and tolerant believer. Whilst he would regard our respective odysseys as vagaries of fate, I continued to sense a Hidden Hand guiding and prompting us. It had driven us apart but made room for a reunion.\nDuring previous trips to Europe, which took place when I traveled on behalf of the Foundation, I came to know Zermatt quite well. The Zermattschein – where Bushi and I had dined on our last day in Zermatt – was still there. Having arrived some two days before the scheduled date, I secured a room overlooking the entrance to the hotel. I felt confident that Bushi would book a room in the pension across the street and keep a lookout. Would he recognise me? He had never seen me wearing orthodox attire or boasting a beard. I, in contrast, had managed to secure his contemporary photograph, taken when he was emerited. In this way, I had an advantage. I would recognise him instantly whilst he might remain in the dark.\nI witnessed Bushi’s arrival. Next morning I spotted him sitting by the window of his room and watching all new arrivals to my hotel. I sensed that Bushi had not lost his touch. He had rightly guessed that I would book a room in the Zermattschein. To put Bushi to the test, I walked out of the hotel, dressed in full regalia. Bushi studied me and appeared bemused: he did not recognise me.\nFor the rest of the day, I shadowed Bushi. I knew he would not travel to lofty plateaus: he used to fear high elevations. On the day agreed by us, I left a message in his pension advising that a table had been booked in his name.\nBushi looked stunned when he came face to face with me in the private room I had managed to secure.\n“Which role are you playing today?” he asked after settling down.\n“No role: you see me ‘as I am’.”\n“So you have become a ‘frummer’ (highly-orthodox Jew). In Tichon you were just moderately orthodox.”\n“I haven’t changed my orientation; only my attire!”\n“Next you’ll be wearing the emperor’s clothes!”\nIt dawned on me that, if I had not seen Bushi’s picture, I might have failed to recognize him. His face had changed, his shoulders were sagging and he had put on weight. His expression, though, had remained unaltered. He still looked confused and, to a point, out of place.\n“Calm down, Bushi. I won’t bite you!” I assured him.\n“I’m sure you won’t: I am not Kosher,” he muttered and started to study the menu.\n“Have a glance at the Kosher items. The goose is excellent and I brought with me a bottle of Carmel Hock. We used to drink it when we had enough money. It goes well with the goose.”\nOver the starters, we gossiped about old classmates. To my relief, Bushi relaxed, came to life and grinned happily when I reminded him of the practical jokes we used to play in our far-gone formative years. He roared when I reminded him how we had ambushed Tichon’s Principal and pelted him with water bombs.\nHe became sedate when I told him the depressing developments in Shosh’s life, but was impressed when I confided that Avner, Shosh’s son, would take over my functions in Brooklyn. He was tickled when I related one of my last encounters with Shosh.\n“So in the very least she ceased to be a glutton,” he mumbled. “And all-in-all her prospects are good. You are bound to ensure that Avner is a success. Shosh would be thrilled. And, Pilkin, perhaps Uzi’s demise was timely.”\nA solemn mood descended when our main courses were served. As agreed, each of us narrated his odyssey. When we were done, Bushi fell into a reverie. As he returned from this far away journey, he observed that both of us had developed trends that had manifested themselves in our youth. I had remained an observant yet tolerant Jew and chose to play a Rabbi’s role. In a sense, Bushi averred, I had remained an actor. His dream of becoming a successful courtroom advocate had failed to materialise. All the same, he pursued an academic career in his chosen area.\n“But surely, Bushi, my calling is more than a mere role. I lead a congregation! And you, my old friend, try to teach youngsters how to become great lawyers. It seems to me that both of us have retained the urge to influence others; and both of us brought our respective ships home!”\n“Well put,” he conceded, “but our great dreams have not materialised. Don’t you agree?”\n“I do, actually. Still, both of us opted for the bird in the hand and not for seven on a tree!”\n“You mean: we became realists; don’t you, Pilkin?”\n“I do, rather.”\n“So both of us followed the path mapped out by Fortuna!”\n“I prefer to put it in a different way. We followed the lead prescribed by a Hidden Hand: an imperceptible hand which some of us refuse to acknowledge.”\n“You and your personal God, Rabbi Zohar! Where was He during the Holocaust? Fast asleep: wasn’t he?”\n“Stop scoffing, Bushi. All in all, you have done well. And please recall that, to you, I shall always remain Pilkin. As to the Holocaust, don’t forget that, in the end, it triggered off the Foundation of Israel.”\n“I am aware of the fact, Pilkin. Hitler’s regime also led to mass migration of Jews to the United States,” he told me belligerently.\n“Is that an unfavourable development?” I asked genuinely puzzled.\n“I am afraid it is. You see, Pilkin, the Jews are a small minority of the American population; but look how vocal they are. And they control the economy: they run Wall Street as well as the Federal Reserve. Surely, you heard some nasty sayings about us?”\n“Eh?’\n“They say, inter alia, that America ought to change its name from ‘U.S.A.’ to ‘Jews.S.A.’ And this is not the only derogatory proverb.”\n“Pfui, Bushi,” I let my chagrin show. “Surely, such pronouncements are false and incorrect.”\n“I am not the originator of such filthy remarks. But the very fact that people say them is, in itself, a bad omen!”\n“What do you mean?”\n“I fear that the United States will be the location of the next calamity. We, the Jews, always migrate to places that appear to be safe havens. Initially, we are welcome. The situation changes when we flex our muscles and take a lead or a powerful position. In a way, our achievements and ghetto mentality – I mean our tendency to congregate in given districts – breed anti-Semitism. Still, we – I mean you and I – are unlikely to be affected. You will retire in your cottage in Safed; and I shall remain in the City of the Lion to my very end.”\n“It’s easy for you to foretell quite calmly a calamity in the United States or in the world as a whole. You do not have offspring. How about my son and daughter? How about my grandchildren? If you are right, I ought to be concerned for them.”\n“I am not a prophet, Pilkin. And in any event, we cannot control the future. So don’t fret,” he consoled.\n“I don’t,” I replied. “Also, you know, our people have survived many tragedies. I believe we are indestructible.”\n“We may be: I agree. Still, many individuals will perish, especially if the next madman says that a person is a Jew if one of his ancestors in five generations was of our creed.”\nI sensed that it was best to change the subject. Bushi listened carefully as I recounted my very last lunch with Shosh. He did not look surprised when I narrated that, after losing Uzi, Shosh had regained her wolfish appetite.\n“Don’t you worry: I won’t gobble up half of your meal, although the goose is exceptionally good,” he grinned. “As you know, some people say that Judaism is a gastronomic religion. But I am not an observant Jew.”\n“I know. But look here, Bushi: Shosh is unique.”\n“Eh?”\n“After she finished her and most of my meal, she ordered a sort of an Irish coffee.”\n“Did she really?” he asked with awe.\n“She did indeed. Instead of whiskey she asked the waiter to use sweet liquor covered with black coffee and topped with whipped cream.”\n“That’s a Viennese Einspänner; I used to have one when father and I went for afternoon coffee. Pilkin, such a delicacy is a meal by itself.”\n“So it is! And when Shosh finished it, she said it was so good that she had to have another! And she ordered it!”\n“You don’t say,” countered Bushi. It amused me to see that his eyes bulged out of his head and that an expectant expression descended on his face. I was, of course, aware that Bushi retained his sweet tooth.\n“Why don’t you have one? You won’t offend me by taking milk immediately after meat. As you know, my maxim is: ‘live and let live’. What do you say?”\n“Not the best concoction for an old diabetic,” he sighed. Then with gusto, he reached his decision: “The hell with the doctor. I’ll have one.”\nInstantly I felt protective. On the waiter’s advice, I insisted that he use Kirsch and an artificial sweetener rather than a sweet liqueur. Bushi gleamed. Then he looked at me thoughtfully, smacked his lips and uttered the highest Yiddish praise for a dish: á mechayedik. At this juncture my own eyes burst with envy. I knew full well that he was tempting me but wanted to partake. Looking at me aghast, the waiter, who was familiar with our dietary laws, recommended that I substitute a sweet Pflümli for the Kirsch and add a spoon of raw sugar. Grinning with delight, the two of us touched glasses. “To good old Shosh,” yelled Bushi. “Amen,” I retorted.\nWe spent the rest of the evening singing songs of the old days. We then chatted about our exploits during our years in Tichon and in the University. Before we parted, Bushi suggested that we make another rendezvous, this time within a year or two.\n“No Bushi: we don’t want to tempt fate. Here is my personal card. Let us keep in touch from now on.”\nEarly next morning I took a train to Geneva and then flew via London to Tel Aviv. Yentl was waiting for me in Safed. She, too, was perturbed by Bushi’s description of my calling as an act. She insisted that I was a leading religious figure. I was the real thing: not just an actor in orthodox attire.\n“No, Loeb, I disagree with Bushi, unless he maintains that life in itself is nothing but an act.”\n“Perhaps he does, with Bushi you never know.”\n“Then don’t take his words too seriously.”\nYentl was right. Bushi had not elaborated. It was best for me to regard his words as a tactless comment. All the same, I had a nagging doubt. Bushi had prepared himself for our reunion. I sensed that he was unlikely to make an observation, unless he meant what he said.\nTo discuss the matter further I called on my friend Yossi. Having listened to my account intently, Yossi took a view different from Yentl’s.\n“Look here, Chayim, from what you tell me about Bushi, he is unlikely to blurt something out without thinking. Further, he had prepared himself for your meeting. It might have surprised him that you have become a religious leader. But, then, he probably wanted to meet his ‘Pilkin’ of old. He knew your main interest was drama and acting. When addressed to Rabbi Zohar, his remark sounds tactless. When he made it to ‘Pilkin’, it might have been a natural observation. It might even have been a compliment.”\n“Do you share his pessimistic outlook?”\n“Time will tell. I should like to meet him. I suspect I know what the get-together meant to him. He hoped to revive the past. This also explains why he made no reference to his marriage which, as you tell me, has remained unhappy.”\n“In the old days, we were very close. I shared more of my life and dreams with him than with my brother, David.”\n“It clarifies the position. I am sure he relaxed as the dinner proceeded.”\n“He did rather. And you are right, Bushi wanted to travel back to the past.”\n“So did you,” he summed up.\nAfter our spell in Safed, Yentl and I spent a few days in Tel Aviv. We then flew back to Brooklyn. Yentl slept during the flight. I looked at her with esteem. Providence was kind to me. After years spent on the fringes, far away from the limelight, He led me to the centre of the stage. He also sent me a wife I admired. Yentl was a treasure. She had always put my interests above hers. She had turned my odyssey from a mundane trip to a successful journey. The reunion with Bushi drove me back into the past. I enjoyed our dinner. All in all, though, I had no wish to turn the clock back.\nShortly after we were back in Brooklyn, Ruth came to stay with us for a few days. She did so from time to time and was, of course, most welcome. As usual she brought a breath of fresh air to our roomy and empty house. On this occasion, though, I sensed that she wanted to tell us something concerning her life. Her lengthy chat with Yentl underscored my assessment.\nA day after Ruth’s arrival, Yentl told me that Ruth was contemplating marriage. I knew Ruth was very friendly with Meyer, one of her colleagues, who was a staunch reform orientated New York Jew. What I could not understand was what had induced Ruth to talk to Yentl before keeping me officially in the picture.\n“Ruth thinks you want her to marry one of your own disciples,” explained Yentl.\n“She is a grown-up woman. She has every right to plan her own life.”\n“She does not want to hurt your sensitivities.”\n“She needn’t worry,” I assured my wife. “I am glad she is not marrying out. But, Yentl, have you explained to her how important it is to make sure that Meyer is ‘Mr. Right’?”\n“I have; and, in any event, Ruth is sensible. She is aware of the issues involved.”\n“Well, that settles it. Will Meyer come to talk to me?”\n“I invited him for dinner this evening.”\nMeyer appeared ill at ease. It seemed best to nudge him. He broke into a smile when I told him that I hoped he would make Ruth happy.\n“Her happiness will be my first priority, Rabbi Zohar.”\n“Is there any chance of your settling in Israel? I know both of you have jobs in New York. But how about later on?”\n“The answer is complex and I don’t want to make promises I may be unable to keep. Ruth and I are American Jews. Later in life, when we retire, Israel may become the ‘promised land’. For the time being, though, we intend to remain in the United States. New York is our home.”\n“I understand,” I told him. “But will your children have some nexus with Israel?”\n“Most American Jews have it, don’t you know?”\n“I do. But will they learn Hebrew?”\n“Nowadays it may be to their advantage to study Mandarin.”\n“I take your point. However, I hope that my grandchildren will also be conversant in Hebrew and be familiar with our rich literature.”\n“I’ll do my best; but I cannot promise that they will. Nowadays few Jews are conversant in Hebrew. I suspect that outside Israel, Hebrew is becoming, once again, a liturgical language. During my lifetime, our services here will be conducted mainly in English, which is the spoken language of members of the community.”\n“How about Yiddish?”\n“I fear it is dying out. It was the jargon of Ashkenazi Jews in Eastern Europe and it has a rich literature and a grammar. However, there are no longer substantial Jewish communities in Russia, Poland, Latvia or Lithuania – their erstwhile abodes. And Yiddish was never spoken by the Sphardies.”\n“Many American Jews are conversant in it and in some congregations it is still spoken. Further, there are American authors who use it,” I protested.\n“Not many of the younger generation, I fear.”\n“I thought that both in America and in Israel there are clubs, societies and even theatres whose very aim is to keep the tongue alive?”\n“They remind me of medical men, who try to save the life of a critically ill patient. In reality, the best they can do is to prolong the sufferings and postpone the inevitable end. I bet you have read Yiddish authors in Hebrew or English translation.”\n“You are right. I read Shalom Aleichem in translation.”\n“The same is true about most of us. There are a few localities in New York where you can hear Yiddish in the street or in restaurants. But there is no other place in which Yiddish is alive. Even in Israel, Hebrew has ousted Yiddish.”\n“True: Hebrew has become the Israeli tongue. I do not expect to hear Yiddish in Safed, where I hope we shall retire. Actually, would you come to visit us there from time to time?”\n“Of course! This I can promise; and it will be a pleasure.”\nRuth’s wedding was grand. To ensure that it would be universally recognised, they had a civil marriage followed by a traditional Jewish ceremony. Being the bride’s father, I thought it was best not to officiate. Another Rabbi assumed the role and performed well. I enjoyed the celebration and drank the health of the newlyweds. My feelings, though, were mixed. I sensed that my grandchildren would be brought up as American Jews. My family’s Israeli link would culminate on my appointed day. Still, Ruth’s children would be Jewish. They would – I hoped – remain in the fold.\nOn our way from Manhattan to Brooklyn, Yentl looked at me thoughtfully. She had overheard my short chat with Meyer and had scrutinized me during the festivities. When we entered our house, she broke her silence:\n“You don’t look too happy, Loeb. What’s the matter?”\n“It concerns me to think that, involuntarily, I have fathered a new family of American Jews. As you know, I am a Tel Avivi. Israel remains my home.”\n“But you became a Rabbi in Brooklyn and married an American Jewess. You should have known that your children would be brought up in New York. If you wanted to ensure that they became Israelis, you should have settled in Israel years ago. I would have come with you.”\n“I know this. And I have only myself to blame. I was hoping that Ami and Ruth would regard the cottage in Safed as their home.”\n“It has always been a holiday home. Ami and Ruth are conversant in Hebrew and understand Israeli mores. Their lingua franca, though, is English and America’s culture is ingrained in them.”\n“I understand. Still, it would have been nice to keep the link with Israel alive and ticking.”\n“Meyer will try,” she summed up. “But I shouldn’t bank on his success. He is an American Diaspora Jew; not an Israeli.”\n“Somehow I managed to retain my Israeli identity, notwithstanding my having accepted a post in New York,” I defended my own position.\n“How very true, Loeb. But don’t you see? You compromised your stand when you married a non-Israeli Jewess.”\nA sense of being out of touch plagued me. It manifested itself when I attended the next meeting of our Club. Once again our members wanted to stage a play. Their difficulty was to identify a suitable piece. One member suggested Sholem Asch’s God of Vengeance. The play deals with the life of a Jewish brothel keeper, who tries to become respectable by marrying his daughter to a student of a Yeshiva. The play attained fame, or rather notoriety, when performed in New York early in the 20th century. Another member of the Club pointed out that the play was no longer topical. Yet another stressed that the English translation did not convey the humour of the Yiddish original. We then considered other dramas of the same author but nobody was keen to see any of them performed.\nThroughout the discussion, I felt uninterested. I knew that, in the end, the Club would opt for a modern play. I sensed that early works, which suited audiences prior to the end of WWII, had lost their topicality. Ours was a brave new world and the Club had to move with the times.\nOn the way back to our Yeshiva, Avner pointed out that I had not taken part in the discussion. This puzzled him.\n“You were rather aloof today, Rabbi Zohar. Why?”\n“In truth, Avner, I am getting tired. Somehow I yearn for retirement. The hustle and bustle of the present era irritates me. Don’t you think it is time for me to hand the reins over?”\n“You have left your mark here. And you launched my career. I learnt a great deal from you.”\n“You are too kind. But, really, all sagas have to come to their end.”\nA few weeks later Yentl and I flew to Tel Aviv. Prior to our trip to Safed, I called on Ronnie and Galya. They were still in Tel Aviv, happily married and semi-retired. Occasionally Galya took supporting roles in Signon and other ensembles. Ronnie was intermittently consulted on lighting issues arising in plays performed by theatres. He listened with interest to my meeting with Bushi in Zermatt.\n“What do you make of Bushi’s comment, implying that I was playing the role of a Rabbi?” I asked.\n“Did his remark upset you?”\n“Not really. But is he right? Am I an actor playing a Rabbi?”\n“Surely, Chayim, all of us play roles! In Germany, I was Ronald Hirsch – a middle-class banker. I got to my office on time and left when I finished my daily work. In Signon, I was Ronnie Eyal – a disgruntled unionist. Nowadays I am a semi-retired and quite contented family man. Which image is real?”\n“I suspect you just changed your role, Ronnie.”\n“Quite so. And the same applies to you. In the army, you were a capable officer. In Signon, you remained an unsatisfied man hoping to acquire a career on the stage. In New York you became a Rabbi. I suspect you ‘adjusted’ when called to do so by the modification of circumstances.”\n“Wouldn’t that apply to everybody?”\n“I suspect it does!”\nGalya, who was listening to us, nodded. It dawned on me that this comfortable, middle- aged woman, was no longer the hungry and aspiring debutante of old.\nLater in the same week, I had lunch with Shosh. To my delight she looked invigorated. It was clear that she had recovered from the melancholy that engulfed her after Uzi’s death.\n“Anything new, Shosh?”\n“Actually, there is. Pilkin: I am remarrying!”\n“Who is the lucky man, Shosh?”\n“You don’t know him, Pilkin. We met in a Book Club. He is a widower and, I think, is an outstandingly nice person. Well, what do you say?”\n“Warmest congratulations, Shosh. I hope you will be happy. My only question is: why do you want to remarry? Don’t you think it is best to stick to the status quo?\n“I don’t like being on my own. I am not the self-sufficient type. That’s why I decided to remain married to Uzi.”\n“Did you inform Avner?”\n“I’m going to write to him within the next few days. How is he doing?”\n“He is ready to be ordained and to take over. You see, I want to retire. Time does not stand still!”\nShosh listened with interest to my account of the reunion with Bushi. She was pleased to know that he was doing well. His taking up permanent residence overseas did not surprise her. In Israel, Bushi had been an odd man out; life in the Diaspora, as an outsider, might suit him better than the constant struggle to accommodate at home.\nEarly next week, I proceeded to Safed. Yentl was already there. On my way, I reflected on the kindness shown to me by the Hidden Hand. Proverbs (30:10-end) – the passage recited at Mother’s funeral – elucidates the virtues of a ‘worthy woman’ and the lavish praise bestowed on her by an admiring husband and their offspring. Proverbs tell us how she caters for the entire family. I was satisfied that this description befitted Yentl. Throughout her life, my happiness and that of Ami and Ruth was her priority. We were fortunate to have her.\nThe cottage in Safed was warm and welcoming. Yentl had tidied it up and turned one of the rooms into a study. It was bound to be an ideal retirement abode. Obviously, Yentl was cognizant of my wish to stop working in Brooklyn. Although she was by nature an American Diaspora Jewess, she was getting ready to share with me our retreat in Israel. I felt deeply grateful to her. I knew that, if she had expressed the wish to retire in the United States, I should have agreed. Knowing that I loved the peace and quiet of Safed, she accommodated.\nTo clear my mind about my reunion in Zermatt and current plans, I called on Yossi. Having listened to me, he agreed that it was time for me to retire.\n“Chayim, am I right in concluding that you have ‘done your share’?”\n“You are, indeed. In plain language: I am fed up!”\n“How about your interest in acting and in drama in general?”\n“I propose to continue reading works I have missed out on. I do not intend to become idle.”\n“You no longer feel the need to influence events?”\n“I don’t. And, you know, my orientation as Rabbi is becoming old-fashioned. The future must be planned by the younger generation!”\n“You feel you are passé?”\n“I do; and I am!”\n“I wonder if your friend’s – Bushi’s – remark has something to do with it?”\n“What do you mean?”\n“Bushi suggested you were playing a role. I suspect he hit – unintentionally – a sore point. He implied that you weren’t the real thing.”\n“So…?”\n“He suggested that Loeb Zohar suppressed ‘Pilkin’ – the old boyhood friend he craved to catch up with. He felt no affinity for the Rabbi confronting him. The effect on you was profound. He brought home to you that, in his eyes, Pilkin of old was a better individual than Rabbi Zohar and, tacitly, you conceded the point.”\n“How did this influence me?”\n“You decided to take the route back.”\nI pondered over Yossi’s words for a long time. Eventually I conceded: “You hit the nail on its head, Yossi. From now on, please address me as Pilkin.”\n“It will be a pleasure, Pilkin!”\nDuring our period in Safed, I downloaded onto the computer the bulk of my materials. Yentl smiled with satisfaction. She new I had made up my mind and that the reclusive ambience of Safed would suit my new outlook.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novels/bright-lion/part-4/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"10-i-change-my-name-to-loeb-zohar\"\u003e10.

I am glad I had them and have no regrets.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Part 4: Based in New York"},{"content":"On the surface, my friendship with Ranjan remained intact. Inwardly, though, I had misgivings. Jilting a girl was one thing; holding onto money given by the girl in anticipation of a union, put a different connotation on the episode. I knew for certain that, in similar circumstances, I should have restored the money to her family. Keeping it was both inappropriate and improper.\nOn this score, Ranjan showed no remorse. Risking both his own savings as well as Lillo’s bequest, he continued to dabble in the local stock exchange. Bank statements he showed me in confidence indicated that he was making steady gains.\nLillo’s tragedy had a subtle effect on Ranjan’s relations with local girls. In each of his affairs, he made it clear from the start that the liaison was fleeting. If a girl still went ahead in the hope of hooking him, she had only herself to blame.\nTay Fung-Shuo, to whom I told the story when I went to visit him, displayed no emotion. After I finished, he reminded me that all was fair in love and war.\n“But how about money, Mr. Tay?”\n“But – Mr. Mid-Yeast Tourist,” he retorted, resorting to our dialect, “man come from grand but now poor family. What you expect?”\n“But man is from Oxford; man he reads a lot,” I told him.\n“Perhaps his need stronger than morals,” he pointed out. “I think is best you say this not your affair. You see – my friend – to you money is tool for get what you want; you want safety and art. Is easy. But your friend Ranjan he want more; much more. Has great design. So, you not judge him; your – as you say – perspective not same.”\n“I thought you didn’t like him?” I let my surprise show.\n“I don’t,” he followed my lead into plain English. “But I won’t allow an antipathy to cloud my judgment!”\n“But Mr Tay,” I insisted, reverting to our vernacular, “you yourself – you never keep such money. I know: have no doubt!”\n“Is correct,” he conceded. “But if is me, I never take money from her!”\n“Even if you had intended to go ahead and marry her,” I asked, unable to express the sentiment in our jargon.\n“Especially not if is so. Love: you cannot buy and never – never – sell!”\nRanjan did not revert to the subject . True, we lunched together less frequently than before. But in all Faculty and University matters we continued to back one another consistently. In the outside world, though, we became increasingly polarised: each had his own circle of friends and interests.\nThen, one day, Ranjan asked for my support in a personal matter. For quite a while he had been dating an attractive Sinhalese woman, whom I knew well from my involvement in Chinese ceramics. Lydia Fernando was second in rank to our museum’s curator – an eccentric fellow – and went out with him regularly. She turned to other, less unconventional, men when she needed a refuge. Ranjan was one of them.\nFor a while, the conventional gossip was that Ranjan had become the principal man in Lydia’s life. Many thought they were going to tie the knot. Ranjan made no attempt to diffuse the rumours. Lydia, whom I used to accompany on her purchasing sprees of ceramics for our museum, did not drop any hint. As she had often complained to me about our curator’s carryings on, I was perplexed by her rigid silence on her friendship with Ranjan. On the few occasions I referred to him, she changed the subject abruptly, usually by turning to my haven in Chinatown. She was well aware that I loved to talk about my visits to Tay Antiques.\nThe full picture emerged during one lunch with Ranjan. When both of us were enjoying the dessert, Ranjan asked whether I was aware he had reached an impasse in his friendship with Lydia.\n“But Lydia and I talk mainly about ceramics; she told me nothing about the two of you!”\n“Not a word or hint?”\n“Not really, except that she mentioned she was seeing you quite often.”\n“Well,” Ranjan fidgeted as he spoke, “I asked her to marry me; and she turned me down!”\n“Why?” I let my surprise show.\n“She said she wasn’t ready to get married.”\n“Well; she is a career woman,” I sought to get things clear. “Financially she is secure – as secure as most of us!”\n“Come off it, Peter,” growled Ranjan. “Many nurses, dentists and businesswomen do marry!”\n“But most of them want to have a family, Ranjan. Lydia told me – some time ago – she had decided not to have children. I was surprised: the first Asian woman to say such a thing openly.”\n“But how many girls talk to you about such matters?” jibed Ranjan. “And surely men and women get married because they fall in love; or need a companion or just don’t want to be left out.”\n“True,” I conceded; “but – you know – if a woman says ‘no’; that’s that.”\nRanjan’s expression manifested his disagreement. I knew that he had a way of seducing women. He knew how to cajole, overcome resistance based on scruples and, where needed, to capitalise on his charm. He had, I suspected, not reflected on the difference between casual affairs and lasting unions. In his eyes, the male had to lead the way. The woman was supposed to follow in his steps.\nIn many situations, his cynicism was more realistic and worldly than my ultra conservative and indecisive approach to human relationships in general. My need to withdraw the moment I sensed the risk of a snub was alien to his dominant outlook, which militated against conceding defeat. His decision to turn to me in what must have appeared to him a crisis was, thus, puzzling. What had induced him to reveal his setback and how did he expect me to help him? As often before, Ranjan read my thoughts accurately.\n“You are a real friend; I trust you,” he explained.\n“But what can I do?” I asked, still mystified.\n“I want you to talk to Lydia!”\n“But, Ranjan, this is a strictly personal matter. Don’t you think she’ll tell me to mind my own business? My friendship with her is restricted to our interest in porcelain. She is bound to resent my stepping out of line.”\n“She has a great deal of respect for you. She admires your understanding of ceramics and the progress you have been making.”\n“But what can I say to her?”\n“Find out why she doesn’t want to marry me; and try to persuade her to change her mind.”\nI was at that time living as a fellow in a residential hall – King Edward VII Hall – near the General Hospital. Lydia arrived sharp on time for our lunch and, as always, looked neat and well-groomed. I looked at her with admiration. She had turned me down when I tried to date her shortly after my arrival in Singapore. But she had done so gracefully and, ever since, ensured that we remained on friendly terms. My having asked her to have lunch was, thus, not unexpected.\n“So Ranjan asked you to talk to me!” she let her displeasure show when I referred to Ranjan’s quest. “And what did he expect you to do?”\n“He wants me to find out why you turned him down.”\n“That’s simple, Peter: I’m not in love with him!”\n“I thought you went out with him regularly?”\n“I did; but dating and marriage are worlds apart!”\n“I’m not sure I understand,” I stammered.\n“Look here, Peter. Men think it’s alright to go out with a girl, or with a few girls, just for fun. Well, I am a modern woman; if I like a chap I go out with him. But that doesn’t mean I’m after a lifelong relationship! A chap can be fun but poor husband material!”\n“What’s wrong with Ranjan?” I steered us back to the point.\n“He is a self-centred man and takes things for granted.”\n“He won’t expect his wife to stay in the kitchen and raise a family!”\n“True; but her career will always be subordinate to his. And he’d expect her to be a good hostess and help him build up his political career. His role is to keep his devoted wife ‘happy’. I don’t blame him for his outlook. But I have my own interests!”\nLydia’s financial independence backed her declaration of rights. I found her manifesto unobjectionable. She was also right about Ranjan. His patrician lineage ordained that his dictates were paramount. A wife – and later on his children – would do well to take his agenda into account.\nRanjan took the news with apparent calm. A few weeks later, though, he announced his acceptance of a scholarship extended by the American university at which he had spent part of his previous sabbatical. Our Dean shrugged his shoulders and granted him six months of no-pay leave.\nThose months, during which we corresponded sporadically, witnessed a change in my life: I met a pleasant Chinese girl of an Indonesian background. Notwithstanding Ranjan’s letter, in which he pointed out that I was far more Jewish than I realised and advised me strongly against marrying a woman from an alien culture, I continued to go steady with her. Shortly after Ranjan’s return, we celebrated our wedding.\nRanjan remained in Singapore for some six months following his second period of advanced studies. Shortly after his return, Lydia migrated to England. Three months later, Ranjan returned to Ceylon, by then known as Sri Lanka. His idea was to practise at the Bar and step into politics as soon as Fortuna smiled. He feared that if he were to stay put in Singapore for too long, he might miss his chance.\nDespite my firm roots in Singapore, I too planned to leave. The local staff’s ever increasing animosity towards expatriates made my existence awkward. A further factor dictating the move concerned my wife. She had remained closer to her family than to me. I hoped that our ruffled edges would be smoothed out by a change of scenery. The offer of a newly created Chair of Law in Wellington provided a suitable opening.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/a-candid-obituary/chapter-5/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eOn the surface, my friendship with Ranjan remained intact. Inwardly, though, I had misgivings.  Jilting a girl was one thing; holding onto money given by the girl in anticipation of a union, put a different connotation on the episode.

Punching Qin Shi Huang Qin Shi Huang woke from his sleep as soon as the minimised Moti and Peter Gnome materialised in his comfortable bedroom. For a few seconds he pinched his massive arms. Still, he soon realised that his intruders had no physical presence. Otherwise, how could they have dodged the conscientious troopers guarding the entrance to his quarters?\n“Why do you ride on his back?” he wanted to know after he observed us critically.\n“Why ever not? Moti is my good friend and, truth be told, my legs tire much faster than his! So, he gives me a lift.”\n“So, he is considerate. Obviously, he is not human,” summed up our host.\n“Hear who is talking,” I challenged.\n“I am Qin Shi Huang – founder of the mighty Qin dynasty. To use your vocabulary, if I showed consideration to Tom, I should have to treat Dick and Harry in the same way. As you ought to know, I am a Legalist: all fools are equal in my eyes. And, as far as I am concerned, everybody is a fool! Fools do not deserve consideration.”\n“Aren’t there any exceptions to the rule?” asked Moti.\n“Just one but, perhaps, Li Si (Li Shu) is the second.”\n“Stop being clever, Yíng Zhèng. Surely, the captain of a ship of fools is the master jackass,” I proclaimed feelingly.\n“Better than being a dock hand. And don’t you dare use my personal name. Today I am Qin Shi Huang – the founder emperor – to both foes and friends.”\n“But how many friends do you have?” asked perceptive Moti.\n“Need we enter into this?” asked a much-deflated Qin Shi Huang. Then, with a sudden wish to please, he tried to stroke Moti’s dwindled trunk.\n“You can’t be touched,” he let his disappointment show.\n“True; but I can touch you,” I advised and patted his flat nose.\n“Master Kong’s disciples would be dismayed. You did to me that which I can’t do to you. And such an impious act does not make sense. It is stupid. Still, from where do you come?”\n“Does it matter?” asked Moti.\n“I want to know: so it matters!”\n2. Postion Explained to Qin Shi Huang Qin Shi Huang was amazed by my revelations. It took me a while to convince him that time travel was feasible and that the 21st century was just as real as his forgotten age. When I finished my explanation, he wanted to know why I had come to see him. My task appeared strange to him. Who was going to benefit from a series of punches? My decision to select him as a target appeared natural to him. He had no doubt about his place in history; but he wanted to know which of his achievements was the greatest. He realised that, when taken alone, none of them put him on a pedestal.\n“Was it the Great Wall?”\n“Not really. The pyramids were not dwindled by it.”\n“The standardising of currencies, measures and scripts?”\n“Not by themselves. Other great leaders realised the importance of uniformity.”\n“What then?”\n“The totality of your achievements. You unified a set of warring states into a single empire. And you ruled it with an iron fist. You even burned the Confucians and their books so as to nip opposition in its bud. And you gave your people uniform measures, characters and a set of splendid roads. But all was given and taken on your own terms!”\n“I see: my intolerance and ruthlessness impressed you and others.”\n“They did: a lesser leader would not have gone the whole way. Moderation or scruples would have been in his way.”\n“They should not. And I ignored them. You see, absolutism and ruling by consensus are worlds apart. The philosopher-ruler is a mirage,” concluded my host.\n“Nobody would say that of your type of absolutism. You were real; and the toughest.”\n“I had to be. I governed on my own. And so I needed no consensus based on the views of lesser people. Still, I listened to the advice of my subordinates when I asked for it.”\nHe paused for a moment. Then he blurted: “But what am I remembered for – my necropolis?”\n“Not so! Your burial ground was covered by dust accumulated over the ages. Towns were built on top of it. It was discovered by accident when some farmers dug into the ground.”\n“So, what am I remembered for?”\n“You unified China and left an everlasting effect on its culture and progress. True, Kông Füzî’s disciples did their best to eradicate your name from history. But they failed miserably. Still, they vilified you – dubbed you a tyrant and barbarian.”\n“I was a tyrant but not a barbarian.” Pointing at Moti, Qin Shi Huang wanted to know my friend’s real size. It was clear to him that Peter gnome had been minimised. It followed Moti, too, had to be far more substantial in real life.\n“The entire palace might collapse if he reverted to his real size!”\n“Then we better leave well alone. In any event, you got what you wanted and you complimented me. So be gone, my good man.”\n“Goodbye then: one day your necropolis will be unearthed. Farmers will stumble on your terracotta figures. I saw them: they are great.”\n“I did not see them in place; but your words encourage me,” he summed up.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novels/nose-puncher/part-6/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e(ORIGINALLY CALLED YÍNG ZHÈNG)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(260 – 210  BCE)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"1-punching-qin-shi-huang\"\u003e1.

It is neatly divided into two parts: (i) verses 1-11 and (ii) verses 12 to 28.\nThe first part commences with the word ki (כי). Greenstein1 rightly points out that a poetic work does not commence with this word, which – literally translated – means ‘for’.\nRegrettably, though the ensuing words do not constitute a meaningful succession to chapter 27. Indeed, it is difficult to fit them into the contents and the matrix of Job. The book deals with the theodicy issue. The first part of chapter 28 deals with the origin of metals and then proclaims the reign of cause and effect in our planet. It does not add any new nuance about the greatness and the invincibility of God.\nThe second part of chapter 28 is a eulogy of wisdom. The concluding words advise that “the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom: and to depart from evil is understanding” [28:28].\nJust as the first part of the chapter, this eulogy of wisdom does not constitute part of the theological discourse of Job. In the words of Terrien: “There can be little doubt that this magnificent poem [cap. 28:12-28] on the accessibility of wisdom does not belong to the discourse of Job. It is not written in his style; it is not connected with the Joban context.”2\nGreenstein argues3 that the chapter constitutes part of Elihu’s discourse (discussed subsequently). Notwithstanding its elegance and authority, this specific analysis is subject to argument. Elihu’s thesis, to the effect that God is just, is not supported by chapter 28.\nThis leads to the conclusion that chapter 28, as a whole, does not form an integral part of Job. It has been included per incuriam. The error, though, is of considerable antiquity. Parts of chapter 28 are preserved in the Qumran Scroll.4\nTwo points support the conclusion that chapter 28 is not part of Job. First, the MT versions of Job and Proverbs (that have come down to us) are contemporaneous.5 They are an integral part of the Wisdom Literature of the Old Testament and, in the MT, Job is placed immediately after Proverbs.6 The feasibility of errors made in the copying process of biblical books is well known.7 There can be no doubt that the second part of chapter 28, that is, the hymn to wisdom, can be neatly read together with Proverbs. It is in harmony with the sentiments expressed in chapter 8 thereof.8\nAdmittedly, the first part of chapter 28 does not mash neatly with Proverbs; but it might have been meant as a lead up to the notion that wisdom is akin to worship. The reason the compiler placed the hymn of wisdom in Job is because Proverbs deals with points made in it succinctly; a lengthy discourse appeared more in line with Job than with Proverbs. There are, of course, lengthy passages in Proverbs like the praise of a ‘worthy [diligent] wife’ [Prov. 31:10-31]. A lengthy eulogy of wisdom does not militate against that book’s structure.\nThe second point which highlights the alien nature of chapter 28 in the context of Job is in that it breaks the continuity of the main discourse. Chapter 29, which is the first part of Job’s closing monologue, follows naturally after the conclusion of the debates in chapter 27. Chapter 28 simply derogates from the lucidity of the Jobian discourse. The inescapable conclusion is that it does not form part of Job and, in all probability, was inserted in it after the promulgation of an original version which has not come down to us.\nOp. cit, at p. 160.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nS.

Unmasking My conversation with Dennis Gray convinced me that I had uncovered the seedy side of the Seddon case. Still, the picture was incomplete. I wanted to find out more about Seddon. What sort of a man was he? He was prepared to cut corners in his business dealings. But might he, nevertheless, be a decent man? As Jack had pointed out, most people carried out ‘little dishonesties’. Still, they did not turn against their sponsor. Seddon appeared to have done so. “Well,” I asked myself, “would it nevertheless be safe to leave him in charge of your home when you went for a trip abroad?” I felt the urge to meet him.\nSearching for him was hard. He had settled all accounts before he departed from London and did not leave a forwarding address. A casual remark of a bank employee directed my glance to Birmingham. For a while, Seddon had operated a small import and export business. The trail, though, ended there. Seddon had left Birmingham. Nobody could tell me where he had gone to.\nIt was time for the hunter to give up the senseless pursuit. Jack, the publican, smiled sympathetically when I told him.\n“I know the feeling. You try to get there but are thwarted on every turn. Eventually you get fed up. Come, have a shandy.” He had spoken warmly but I noticed that, once again, a speculative or contemplative expression had descended on his face.\n“Thanks,” I said gratefully. “Still, Jack, I can’t understand it. People don’t just vanish into thin air: not in a civilized country.”\n“Not normally. Usually, you can find them through a telephone directory. Actually, what was that chap’s name?”\n“Seddon,” I confided. “Albert Seddon, originally from Manchester.”\nJack did not give a start. But his speculative expression was gone. “Albert Seddon? And the bank? Was it by any chance the Masterman Bank?”\n“It … was,” I stammered as the penny dropped.\n“You could have saved yourself a lot of trouble by telling me the names earlier.”\n“Everybody calls you Jack.”\n“My full name is Albert Jacob Seddon. When I got the liqueur licence and the pub, I decided to drop ‘Albert’.”\n“Why?” I asked perplexed.\n“My customers would have nicknamed me ‘Bert’ or ‘Bertie’. ‘Jack’ sounds better. But you, Peter, have gone all pale. You alright?”\n“Yes, of course,” I assured him.\n“Come, have a coffee.”\n2. The Real Story The story was simpler than I had anticipated. Jack had met Ng during a brief visit to Hong Kong. They became friendly, called on one another from time to time and had a few joint business ventures. Seddon expected to make marginal gains. Actually, the real object of many transactions had been to siphon money out of England. To his disappointment, Albert Seddon soon discovered that remittances of the price of goods to an overseas purchaser were scrutinised carefully by the authorities. When he called on the Masterman Bank to get its advice, they assured him that remittances were not subject to searching scrutiny when made under, or in the context of, a letter of credit.\n“Were you surprised?” I wanted to know.\n“Not really,” grinned Jack. “I was certain that the banks had angles of their own. You realise, Peter, that the banks make a handsome profit from opening letters of credit and the handling of documents tendered under them. Still, for a time the system worked.”\nJack went to explain that, on the face of all the transactions, Seddon paid for the tea a price higher than the London market rate. Ng retained the amount due to him and remitted the balance to Seddon’s Swiss account. As far as the tax authorities were concerned, Seddon made a net loss on the transactions. In the meantime, his Swiss bank account went from strength to strength.\n“I still don’t understand,” I let my surprise show. “How would you have paid Ng without using a letter of credit?”\n“I should have made a down payment and the balance after receiving the goods. I should have sent money to my Swiss account by using other means, like travellers’ cheques. The Masterman Bank came up with the new notion.”\nFor a while, so Jack explained, all went well. Then came the fraud. The ‘tea’ he received was worthless and Ng was not in a position to compensate. Initially, Seddon intended to cut his losses from that deal.\n“But why did you try to get the money back from the Masterman Bank?”\n“They dreamed up the systems. So, they should have warned me about the pitfalls. Naturally, after we switched to letters of credit, Ng did not go down to China to examine the goods. How could we know that we ought to guard our rear by demanding ‘certificates’ of quality or some other such documents. The Masterman Bank should have advised us.”\nJack added that Mike Smith, the solicitor placed in charge of the file, was bullish about his chances of recovering the loss from the Masterman Bank. Mike was confident that Seddon would be able to convince the Court that the real fault, or lack of vigilance, was due to a shortcoming in the system proposed by the Masterman Bank.\nIn the event, Jack Seddon decided to go ahead and, as I well knew, lost the case. He also knew that an appeal was out of the question.\n“Do you think the Judge knew what had been going on behind the scenes?” I asked out of sheer curiosity.\nJack shrugged. “I have no idea. Still, I found out that, before his elevation to the bench, our judge was a successful Q.C., specialising in commercial cases. I suspect he new what was going on.”\n3. Becoming a Publican As already known, Seddon lost his case. Worse still, he lost all the money he had accumulated in Zurich through a series of ill-advised share investments. Ng, too, had lost all his money, albeit on the Hong Kong bourse. Seddon suspected that the supplier in China had sent rubbish instead of tea because he had not been paid for earlier supplies.\n“How did you become a publican?”\n“My business was finished. By sheer chance I saw the advertisement respecting a lease of premises with a liqueur franchise. I decided to give it a try.”\n“By why did you look for this type of business?”\n“I loved to play the role of a bartender in our parties. I enjoyed myself. And people said I was very good. I thought I’d try my hand on it in business.”\n“And it became a successful business,” I ventured.\n“It has. And I have a good and pleasant life; far more enjoyable than the eternal anxiety associated with dealings in letters of credit, in shares and in currencies.”\n“Are you still in touch with Ng?”\n“Actually, I am. He, too, brought his ship home. He has become an exporter of exotic food stuffs. He does well out of it. And he still lives in Hong Kong.”\n“Do you call on him when you travel?”\n“Last time I was in Hong Kong, he treated me to crocodile meat.”\n“Oh!”\n“It was very good,” Jack grinned.\n4. Jack’s Career as Publican I kept reflecting on Jack the publican as I walked back to my room in Newton Road. During my months in Oxford, Jack had mentioned that he had two sons. The older, Vince, served in the police force. The younger had just completed his A Levels and had enrolled in a red brick university for a course in civil engineering. Jack’s daughter was going steady with an undergraduate. Jack hoped they would get married as soon as the boy found a suitable job as a journalist.\nJack himself enjoyed a steady and pleasant family life. He struck me as a typical member of the lower middle classes. How could he, possibly, have had an alter ego seeking the limelight of financial dealings and the excitement of foreign trade?\n5.My Final Assessment of Seddon In my original perception, the facts did not add up. Albert Seddon, the businessman who wanted to recover his business losses from his bank, was miles apart from Jack, the warm-hearted publican. I should gratefully accept the latter’s offer to look after my affairs if I had to travel overseas. In contrast, Albert Seddon – a dabbler in finance - invoked my distrust.\nOn further reflection, I decided I was wrong. Albert Seddon’s attempt to recover his losses from the Masterman was understandable. They ensnared him in a quagmire without providing adequate commercial safeguards. Seddon’s interest in commercial dealings was, likewise, not out of the character of Jack. The latter, too, loved to impress his audience by his mastery at darts. Both Jack and Albert were showman. But each was loyal to friends and admirers. The attempt to recover his loss from the Masterman Bank was understandable as, indeed, were Jack’s reservations about his lawyers’ behaviour.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/worthless-goods/part-6/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"1-unmasking\"\u003e1.

And tell me: if you yourself wanted to have a ‘good day in court’ would you have engaged an Octogenarian?”\n“Thomas is sill lively enough,” I protested.\n“Yes, Peter, on the rare occasions in which he does not fall asleep during the proceedings.”\n“Quentin, Quentin, aren’t you indicting the legal profession as a whole?”\n“Not really, Peter. Most firms send you grazing when you are 60 or so. Some old timers continue thereafter on their own. But how well do they do? And look here: would you yourself take on the role of a lead counsel in such a difficult case?”\n“Actually, I would not. I know I lack the stamina. Age has caught up with me. Effectively, I have retired from practice.”\n“And you were an excellent strategist.”\n“I was; but time does not stand still.”\n“And your friend Thomas was never top class: not even in his heyday. I became suspicious about the case when I was told that he had been briefed. There are plenty of young lawyers who want to be constituted Senior Counsel. They would have given us a run for the money.”\n“Well, well, well, Quentin. So, all in all nobody made a gain.”\n“Except yours truly. You see: they moved me to Head Office when I unravelled the case and got rid of the internal crook. But banks – as you always tell us with a malicious grin – are parsimonious. I did not get a bonus; just a laudatory letter of thanks from the Chairman. The Roman Catholic church would, in the very least, have canonised me: St. Quentin, the Bloodhound.”\n“I accept your analysis. But, then, why on earth did Thomas consult me? Why did he and Freddie make a half-hearted attempt to drag me into the ring?”\n“Thomas needed an endorsement. Some respected lawyer, who would confirm they had a weak case. He must have got worried when you started to dig.”\n“He did look uneasy. But I thought he feared losing face in front of the clients. Quentin, do you think he smelt a rat?”\n“I can’t be certain, Peter. But he did not want to fight the case. Nowadays he prefers to settle. A day in court is becoming painful. He knew there were problems undermining our position as regards the applicable terms. But you, Peter, were told to keep out of that. He concluded that he better accept that our terms apply. He asked you to write an opinion on an obvious point.”\nFor a while both of us kept staring into the distance. I knew that Quentin was right. I had been used as a cat’s paw. Still, I had been paid and so had nothing to grumble about.\nI realised that the issues of the case had been solved and sorted out. To change the subject, I took out of my briefcase a new book with Bridge Quizzes. Before long both of us were immersed in them.

Banks premises, Norbert told us the he had examined the transaction and was satisfied it was an ordinary trade deal. In the circumstances, we decided he could go ahead. Both Freddie and I felt relieved.\nAt 4 pm, Norbert rang up Hendra. He confirmed the receipt of the funds but added that the bank had exercised its set-off. In consequence, the account balance was well below the amount Hendra had ordered the Bank to remit.\nHendra exploded but, after some empty threats, fixed an appointment to discuss the matter. When he arrived, Norbert and I were ready to face him. At this stage, our compliance officer – Freddie – thought it best to keep out of the picture.\nTo my relief, Hendra did not query the Bank’s right of set-off. He did not ask us to produce the original of the set-off agreement. Further, Hendra acknowledged that he had received his monthly statements. Without any tussle, he asked Norbert to approve the ensuing overdraft.\n“I can’t grant you such an amount. Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is well above my authorised margin. And you know: your account has been the subject of concern.”\n“But if I don’t pay up, the supplier of the phones may try to seize them before they are unloaded. I must pay!”\n“But then, Bang Bang,” Norbert addressed his client informally, “why don’t you remit the money from your wife’s account? You have moved it to another bank. But we know you have a substantial credit balance there.”\nHendra didn’t claim that the money belonged to his wife rather than to himself. He knew we were familiar with his trading patterns. Instead, he told Norbert candidly that this money was required for his ongoing dealings. If he lost control over these funds he would be “commercially finished”.\n“I understand, Bang Bang. And you know I always try to help you. But the head office would chop my head off if I authorised the remittance. Why don’t you give us a cheque for, say, S$200,000?”\n“I can’t, Norbert: honestly. It would be my ruin. You can’t let this happen, my friend. How about a cheque for S$75,000?”\nFor a while they haggled. Hendra tore his hair and pretended to break down. Norbert did his best to appear supportive and understanding; but the twinkle in his eye remained unchanged throughout the scene. I was relieved when, after some twenty minutes of pantomime, Hendra agreed to give us a cheque for S$125,000. Norbert promised to order the remittance of the funds as soon as the cheque had cleared. Smiling supportively, he proffered Hendra his own pen.\n“This was used to sign the ASEAN Treaty, Bang Bang,” he advised proudly.\n“Can I have it?” asked Hendra eagerly.\n“Of course!” said Norbert magnanimously, whilst I hid my face in a sheaf of papers and did my best to suppress a fit of laughter.\nTo my relief, Freddie was happy with the arrangement. All in all, it meant that Hendra’s overdraft was reduced to some S$125,000. Like the rest of us, Freddie knew that to win some you could not help losing others. In the instant case, the loss was moderate.

As was to be expected, witnesses of facts (and potential witnesses like Yuri) were no longer in attendance or in the ante-room. Further, Vollar’s expert-witness had withdrawn in the last minute. My duty of objectivity imposed on me as an expert of banking practice was, accordingly, undisputable.\nJack Wilson started his examination-in-chief by presenting my report and by asking if I felt the need to change it in any regards. I responded that I felt no reason to do so. Jack concluded that I was aware that my principal duty was to assist the court. Stepping in, the Judge emphasised the special duty of objectivity imposed on me as the single expert called as a witness.\nVollar’s Counsel then rose to cross-examine. He was not surprised when I affirmed that the practice of banks in Australia, the United kingdom, in New Zealand and in Singapore was to disclaim liability when they gave a reference.\n“Who would communicated the disclaimer to the enquirer?”\n“The employee charged with the reading out of the reference.”\n“You agree that such a person might, occasionally, forget to read out the disclaimer.”\n“Such an event can happen,” I agreed.\n“Is this a common slip?” asked the Judge.\n“Not in my experience, Your Honour.”\n“Do Belgian banks disclaim liability?”\n“I cannot answer the question. You Honour, I am unfamiliar with Belgian banking practice.”\nCounsel turned to the issue concerning the composition of the reference. I had anticipated that line of enquiry and was prepared.\n“You Honour,” I turned to the Judge, “the persons who rights the reference is usually the branch manager or the relationship-manager in charge of the account, the enquiry’s subject. He is not expected to investigate extra issues and is entitled to compose his reference on the basis of his general knowledge of the account. He must, of course be careful not to disclose details subject to the bank’s duty of secrecy.”\n“Such as?” asked the Judge.\n“For instance, that each months they have to make a deduction of maintenance to be remitted to a separated wife or even deduction related to payment of rentals made by the customer. Actually, Your Honour, in some countries a reference is communicated only after it has been approved by the customer. The practice does not apply in Australia.”\n“So, the composer of a reference respecting me would not disclose that, every month, I remit a fees to my piano teacher,” jested the Judge.\nLeaving this line of questions, Counsel raised an unexpected point. He wanted to know if the object of the enquiry would be disclosed to the composer of the reference. Noting my discomfort Jack Smith raised an objection. This issue had not been raised in the pleadings and was accordingly irrelevant. During the heated exchanges between him and Vollar’s Counsel I had the time to formulate my reply. As soon as my expression regained its earlier aura of confidence, Jack withdrew his objection subject to a right to recall witnesses depending on my reply. The Judge nodded approvingly. He was keen to get to the bottom of things.\n“Your Honour, as far as I know there is no uniformity of practice. The request for a reference is usually communicated by the enquirer to his own bankers. These transmit it to the bank which provides the information. The latter will be told about the object of the enquiry only if it is revealed by the enquirer to his own bankers. In the case of potential take-over bids, for instance, the enquirer may not wish to disclose the object of his enquiry. He may describe it as a ‘general enquiry’.”\n“But for what reason? Would he not be reassured by the doctrine of bank secrecy?” asked the Judge.\n“The doctrine is, of course, applicable, Your Honour. But it is unlikely to prevent bank employees from gossiping, for instance, about X’s intention of taking over Y, or of his interest of entering into a joint venture with him.”\nThe Judge was about to raise another point, when Vollar’s Counsel advised that he had just received a note from his client. It confirmed that Vollar had described his request for a reference as a ‘general enquiry’ about the Katz’s business.\n“Then the issue just raised in respect of banking practice is irrelevant here,” concluded the Judge. Jack Wilson nodded.\n“No further questions,” advised Vollar’s Counsel.\nAfter a short reflection, the Judge suggested written submissions. When both Counsel nodded their approval, he rose.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/matter-of-opinion/part-6/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eNext morning It was my turn to step into the witness box.

I was by then certain Fischer was lying between his teeth. Ruth was prepared to stand by him. Still, she had not asked us to throw the towel in.\nTo look up recent authorities, I went down to the Supreme Court library on Sunday morning. As soon as I entered, I spotted Boaz. He, too, was refreshing his memory. To my delight, he invited me to have morning coffee with him.\n“I hear you’ve come back for a visit, Eli.”\n“News travel fast in this town, Boaz. Sorry for not calling on Miri and you. Yokneam is a bit out of the way. Actually, I’m told you’ve entered into politics.”\n“I’m a Mapam beck-bencher now, Eli. Still, I do appear from time to time when I need the money. But tell me: are you happy in Singapore?”\n“Contented is the right word. I fit in without belonging.”\n“Here you belonged but, in many ways, you did not fit in.”\n“True: but I’ve had really good friends.”\n“You still have them,” he assured me.\nBefore long, we turned to the case. Boaz was aware I had been briefed. Naturally, we had been pitted against one another on previous occasions. We had also appeared together, albeit for different parties, in complex cases. Our professional engagements had never marred the close friendship we had developed during our days at the University. I had been a frequent guest in Boaz’s welcoming home and, both he and his wife, had been to my home. I suspected that, like myself, Boaz looked forward to our forthcoming appearance. Both of us could be tricky. But we had always been fair to one another in our skirmishes.\nLike Rachel and I, Boaz had noted the oddities in Fischer’s testimony. Still, he decided not to raise the issues because he, too, realised the case was bound to turn on the fine legal point. Further, Fischer had acquainted him with Ruth’s remarkable instructions. In consequence, Boaz concluded that Fischer would not be subjected to a devastating cross-examination.\n“Still, Boaz, Fischer is no fool. He’s a cunning bastard. What made him come up with these stupid assertions? Off the record, do you know what is behind them?”\n“I’ve no idea, Eli. I’ve tried to probe. But Fischer has been evasive. I am as much in the dark as Rachel and you!”\nBoaz knew that any information he gave me off the record would remain confidential. Quite apart from the bond of friendship, my silence was dictated by the code of conduct of our legal world.\nBoaz’s next observations threw light on one point. The excessive amount of the claim was Fischer’s own idea. Boaz had warned him that, even if the Judge accepted that amount as a ‘base 1’, he might have to take into account Fischer’s contributory negligence. If, for instance, he decided that Fischer ought to bear half the loss, the damages would be reduced accordingly. Fischer had listened attentively but, in the event, decided to claim the largest amount feasible.\n“He won’t get that, Boaz. Not if the Judge is going to be Ehud Morag.”\n“Well Morag has agreed to hear it. Think about it, Eli. He was our teacher. And we used to appear before him in moots, in debates and in court.”\n“He is brilliant: best legal mind I know.”\n“He is. But you better prepare yourself for a shock, Eli. You must have heard that Morag’s wife left him.”\n“Rachel told me about it. I felt sorry for him. He was devoted to his elegant, even if playful, wife.”\n“Her desertion affected him. Then, one of Morag’s best friends committed suicide. It hit Morag hard. We’ll have to handle him with extra care. We were his favourite students. And you know: he remembers. When I appeared before him in chambers on another matter, he asked about you. He knows Rachel and you broke off.”\n“Did he attend her wedding?”\n“I don’t think she invited people. It was a very private occasion. Still, Rachel’s Uzi operated on Morag’s knee.”\n“It’s a small world,” I muttered.\n“Incestuous. Everybody knows everybody and everything, except the truth.”\nIn the event, we agreed to ask that the case be heard in two parts. The first, we concluded, ought to deal with the issue of liability. Did a developer owe any duty of care to his consultant? The second stage ought to deal with the issue of damages and contributory negligence.\n“Once we get over the ‘liability’ issue, everybody would wish to settle,” grinned Boaz.\n“Why haven’t they settled up to now?”\n“Rachel offered Fischer a niggardly amount. In his chagrin, he instructed me not to negotiate any further.”\n“What a pity,” I muttered.\n“Oh, I don’t know about that. It ain’t so bad for our fee notes.”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/scaffolding/part-6/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eOn Saturday –  the day of rest in Israel –  I went again through the documents.

Boaz was smirking. “I thought you’d help the Balanis; sorry I couldn’t: I had an urgent ‘phone call.”\n“As good a reason as any,” I muttered.\n“Now, now, Eli – sarcasm is lost on my deaf ears; or – you could say – water down a duck’s back. But you are right: I wanted the two of you to get acquainted.”\n“I wish you hadn’t! Simha told me something that’s none of my business. He mentioned Yossi. I’ll have to raise his ‘rashness’ as a defence if the case goes to trial. You know that!”\n“I do! But you were bound to find out in any event. Our law encourages ‘fair play’!”\nHe was, of course, right. Different procedural devices, taken from English law, enabled a party to legal proceedings to get from the other the information required for his strategy.\n“What are the chances of Simha accepting our offer, Boaz?”\n“I suspect Shimon will dig his heels in, Eli. It’s stupid; but it’s not in our control.”\n“What’s the matter with the chap?”\n“He reckons it’s his big chance. If the background isn’t clear, have a word with Rachel!”\nBoaz’s reference to Rachel did not take me by surprise. Rachel and Boaz had been classmates in University and knew one another well. They had also crossed swords in court and, in the process, developed mutual respect for one another’s ability. In point of fact, she was a party to the discreet talks concerning the plans for a new legal partnership. Further, Boaz knew that Rachel’s insights into sociological and behavioural issues were sharper than mine.\nRachel listened keenly to my description of the meeting with the Balanis and my conversation with Boaz. To my surprise, her reaction was stronger than I had anticipated. Grinning malevolently, she came over and patted my shoulder as if I were a dumb child. “So, my pet, you let ‘partner Boaz’ set you-up.”\n“You better explain yourself!” I let my chagrin show.\n“That scrap your good friend Simha volunteered about Yossi: a bit too artificial, eh?”\n“It was out of context, rather.”\n“Don’t you think Boaz coached him?”\n“What for?”\n“You would find out in any event. And this way, he invoked your sympathy, didn’t he?”\n“He did rather: don’t you think Simha’s act was noble?”\n“But why toot his horn? Boaz knows you well, Eli!”\n“So he knows I’ll have to plead the point whether I like it or not!”\n“True; but he knows this way you are less likely to make a song and dance about it.”\nRachel’s pronouncement highlighted the unkind treatment meted out by our law to the good Samaritan. At one stage, a party in Simha’s position was bound to lose his case. A fireman, who rushed into a burning house without adequate safeguards, or a brave citizen who jumped into a pond to save a drowning child, were regarded “volunteers”, who took on a risk with its natural consequences. As a result, their position was precarious: as volunteers, they got nothing! Modern law replaced this Draconian doctrine with the notion that a good Samaritan had to bear a share of the ensuing loss commensurate with his ‘contributory negligence’. Simha’s rush into the danger zone was a classic case in point. His ‘contribution’, though, would be ‘measured’ by the judge on the basis of the arguments pressed on him. My attitude, as counsel of the parties sued, would make all the difference.\n“You are right,” I told Rachel. “But I still don’t get what Boaz meant when he said you’d explain to me Shimon’s resistance of a pension. In my eyes, he is nothing but a selfish swine!”\n“I don’t think that fair, Eli. Do you remember that incident when we went to the Bezalel Museum on Shabbath?”\nRachel’s words rang a bell. A few months earlier on, I persuaded Rachel to visit the Bezalel Museum. Naturally, the main office box was closed out of respect for the day of rest but a discreet notice directed us to a less conspicuous ticket office in a small lane nearby. When we returned with the entry tickets, a group of excited Jewish oriental youngsters, who thought they were being denied access on ethnic grounds, were having a shouting match with the doorman. To calm them down, Rachel gave them our tickets and insisted we accompany the remaining members of the group to the camouflaged ticket office. Once they understood the issue, the group paid for our tickets and treated us to soft drinks.\n“But what has this got to do with the Balani case? What does ‘background’ – if that’s what we want to call it – have to do with pension vis-à-vis lump sum?”\n“ ‘Background’ is the key to Shimon’s attitude. He is convinced his ‘people’ are disadvantaged. Even if one of them is as good as ‘others’, he doesn’t get an ‘even chance’: all cards are staked against him. But here is Shimon’s chance. He wants to make the most of it!”\n“And if he makes it, he’ll look well after Simha?”\n“He will, Eli!”\n“And if he fails? Doesn’t he think about the dire consequences?”\n“He closes his eyes to them. Like Simha himself, he believes the world owes him. And here is his chance to get delivery.”\nFor a while both of us were immersed in our thoughts. Rachel had hit the nail on its head. All the same, much remained unclear: “So there’s no chance for a settlement, Rachel?”\n“None!”\n“Did Boaz know?”\n“I am sure he did!”\n“So why the pantomime this morning?”\n“Boaz’s a good lawyer. He knows it’s in Simha’s interest to take the pension. You can’t blame him for trying. Now his conscience is clear! You would have used the same tactics.”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/simha-glory/part-6/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe ‘phone rang as soon as I entered my office.

It reinforced her assessment of her boyfriend: an eccentric with an unworldly outlook. Her light-hearted airs gave way to a serious reflection when I outlined the information about the manufacturers’ response and the relationship between Rotem and Franz Wolf’s firm. She thought it best to discuss it straightaway with our employer.\nJacob Keren looked grave but was not unduly perturbed by the poor outlook of an action against the German firm. In any event, an attempt to sue it had to be deferred for the time being. Our clients were not wealthy and proceedings in a foreign country would entail extra expenses. This avenue might, however, be explored later on either by Franz Wolf’s firm or, possibly, by Rotem. In turn, the matter might be settled between the re-insurance companies of Rotem and of the insurers who covered the German manufacturers. Presently, we had to plan our campaign against Rotem.\nJacob Keren conceded that the position was complicated by his own ambivalent position. As a non-executive director, he owed duties to Rotem. These were not vacated by Rotem’s consent to his acting for Dahlia. To her, though, he owed the usual solicitor’s duties to a client.\n“But then,” pointed out Rachel, “when Rotem agreed to let you act for Dahlia, they knew your duties to her would become paramount!”\n“But Dahlia and her mother know of my relationship with Rotem. They engaged me with the knowledge that I cannot dismiss my directorship from my mind. One of the reasons for my delegating the case to you two, was to avoid any accusations about a conflict.”\n“From a practical point, what does this mean?” she wanted to know.\n“I can – and will – consider the plan you form. But I should not, in all conscience, work out your strategy.”\n“So – all in all – you have the cake and eat it!” she pointed out.\n“You can call it that. I prefer to see myself as a sort of mediator. But, of course, whatever I discuss with you, will not go beyond the door of this room. Similarly, I won’t be able to let you in on any deliberations of Rotem.”\nJacob Keren then listened to the information I had obtained. He had doubts about my argument respecting a contract for the dispatch of renewal notices. In English law, the argument would not even get off the ground. It was – he added malevolently – a red herring. European systems were, of course, irrelevant: they did not apply.\n“But suppose the position is governed by Turkish law?” I asked.\n“Are you trying to fit this so-called contract into a provision of Turkish law?” sneered Keren.\n“I, too, wonder about your idea,” broke in Rachel.\nTheir apprehensions were understandable. Before the British armies took over Palestine, the applicable private law was to be found in a Turkish Code known as the Mejelle. Just before the outbreak of World War I, the Turks realised that the Mejelle had become outdated. Many modern transactions could no longer be fitted into the ambit of its rigid Articles. To overcome the difficulty, they passed a new Law, numbered as section 64 of the Civil Procedure Law, which declared that any agreement between parties was binding and valid provided its object was lawful.\nMy argument was that under this section Rotem’s undertaking to dispatch renewal notices when the firm’s policy was about to expire constituted a binding contract. As section 64 had not been repealed or chucked out when the British took Palestine over, it had remained in effect. A contract deriving its force from it was valid even if it did not satisfy the technicalities of the English law of contract.\n“Are you serious about this argument?” protested Jacob Keren. “Aren’t you flying a kite?”\n“Of course not, Mr. Keren. Just consider the issue objectively. If you reject my argument you aver that the good old absurdities of the ancient Mejelle had been replaced by the sheer technicalities of English law. If the British administration had sought to achieve such a result, why didn’t they kick out the Turkish law of contract and applied English law in its entirety?”\n“An interesting point. Do you have any authorities in support?”\n“In expect to find some in law reports of the British period. Many Colonial Judges were eccentric barristers, who did not fit in at home. I should not be surprised if some of them were prepared to strike a blow at the sacrosanct English law!”\n“It’s worth a try,” Keren agreed. “Even if it is not clear cut, it’ll provide a stick to beat Rotem. They’d hate to be told that English law doctrines can be challenged! I suspect they would, rather, admit liability.”\n“Shall I then begin the search?”\n“Sure,” he consented. “But we must also keep our clients informed. I’ll ask them to come over this week.”\nDahlia and her mother had little to add to our professional analysis. It went over their heads. To them only one issue mattered: would we manage to get enough money to do whatever was possible for Dahlia. How we got it was immaterial. Rivka Nissim, though, sensed the sailing might not be smooth.\n“But why does all this stuff matter so much?” she wanted to know.\n“Because we need an argument to persuade Rotem to pay,” explained Rachel. “Usually, an insurance company does not settle a claim if the policy has lapsed.”\n“But don’t we have rights against them?” Rivka persisted.\n“I’m afraid not,” explained Rachel. “Their customer is Wollor and so we cannot sue them directly.”\n“But I’m sure Mr. Wolf does everything he can,” chimed in Dahlia.\n“He does,” Rachel assured her. “The problem is to persuade Rotem.”\n“What do you intend to do?” asked Rivka.\n“We are trying to formulate a good legal argument,” explained Jacob Keren. “And Eli has an idea. But it must be researched and so he must look up some books in Jerusalem.”\n“But won’t this be very expensive,” she asked apprehensively.\n“We’ll treat this as ‘general research’ of the firm. I’m sure the results will bear fruit in days to come,” Keren assured her.\n“Thanks. Sometimes, you know, I feel I am a very lucky girl!”\n“What do you mean, Dahlia?” asked Rachel, startled.\n“The accident, of course, was bad luck. But look how kind everybody is to me. Mom is looking after me so well; and Mr. Wolf: he is really good to me; and now you. And I know I’m in good hands; and this is so comforting.”\n“It’s alright, Dahlia,” Rachel hurried to assure her; “it’s the least we can do.”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ravages-of-a-guillotine/part-6/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eMy experience with figurine brought a smile to Rachel’s face.

Once again she had lost weight, looked worn out and a dry cough and persistent wheeze marred her speech.\n“You need a real break, Hannah. “And you ought to spend a few days in Eilat. A change of climate can do wonders.”\n“Next week I’m taking Tali to Tiberias. I’ll be away for two or three weeks.”\n“Give me a tinkle if you need anything,” I offered.\n“I shan’t need a thing. I’m going to leave the office behind!”\n“Good on you!” I approbated. “In the words of Goethe: ‘it [the office] can lick… ”.\n“Now, now, Eli,” Hannah burst into a fit laughter interrupted by a cough, “poetic licence is prohibited in all respectable law firms! And we better spend a few minutes on the Omri Tal case. I read your memo. So you think Morag will do?”\n“I’m positive.”\n“Very well then. And, Eli, I’m glad you didn’t follow up Jacob Keren’s hint. I wanted to warn you off but got too entangled in my recent case. I didn’t have the chance to talk to you.”\n“Still, don’t we have to go back to Keren?”\n“No! We won’t! I\u0026rsquo;ll take the responsibility! And, Eli, for all practical purposes you are in charge. As soon as I’m back, Jacob Keren and I have to get ready for the next phase of our major case.”\n“What if Keren raises the Omri Tal matter with me when you are away?”\n“He won’t. Malka is taking him for a holiday in Cyprus. They leave tomorrow. And if he feels up to it, she proposes to book a cruise to the Greek Islands. He, too, will be away for a few weeks.”\n“Is Keren in a bad way?” I asked. “I thought he took court cases in his stride.”\n“He isn’t getting younger! And this is a particularly tricky matter.”\n“Well, Hannah: don’t let him drag you into cases like that.”\n“Actually, Eli, I’m going to do better than that!”\n“How?”\n“I’m quitting!”\n“Quitting?\u0026quot;”\n“Yes, Eli. I can’t go on like this! And it’s not just my health!”\n“What else?”\n“The other day I came home just before midnight. Tali was all worked up. She wanted to know if I had an affair with Jacob Keren!”\n“I hope you gave her a good hiding!”\n“No, Eli. That would have been counter-productive. I simply told her what Keren and I had been working on – step by step. Before long she broke into tears, hugged me and said she’d quit school and get a job so that I could have a decent rest. And she warmed up the dinner she had made for us and insisted I eat; and it was delicious!”\n“But what has all this got to do with your job here?”\n“A teenaged girl like Tali needs her mother. I’ve neglected her long enough! As things stand, I’m never at home before 8.00 p.m. It ain’t right!”\n“But do you have another job?”\n“As a matter of fact, I do. Rotem is setting up a Legal Department. It’ll take charge of lending contracts, mortgage registrations, debt collections and run of the mill litigation. Ruth Schwartz offered me the job. It’s not as glamorous as doing big cases with Keren. But the salary is O.K.; and it’s a 9.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m. desk job: just what I want. And Keren can look for some other aspiring lawyer to take my place! I’m tired of the limelight!”\n“I can see your point, Hannah. I only hope I shan’t be Keren’s next victim!”\nHannah broke into a smile. “You need not fear. Keren knows your strength is working out complex legal points. He prefers to work with somebody who is strong on facts and practicalities.”\n“That leaves me out.”\n“It does. So don’t worry!”\n“Well, how about the Omri Tal case? Keren won’t let me handle a full trial for at least another year or two. Will you be able to appear?”\n“I think so. Rotem expects me to take up court cases from time to time. So even if the case is heard after I leave, I’ll be able to take it on by arrangement.”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/the-luck-of-valentino/part-6/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA  few  days passed before I managed to track Hannah down.

Despite his advanced age, Peppi adjusted to his new environment in no time. Soon he felt at home both in Hampstead and in Kensington Church Street. With the joint efforts of father and daughter, Theophil’s Antiques continued to flourish. Within two years, they had taken over all the shopping space in the house. To facilitate further expansion, Peppi purchased the building.\nSocially, too, Peppi’s move proved successful. To his own surprise, he was elected Treasurer and later on President of Artiquar. He was also elected an officer of the Association of Antique Dealers and became a regular contributor of articles on old master prints and on tapestries. In addition, he frequented important auctions held in the international sales rooms. This regular attendance at leading events contributed to the rapid growth of Theophil’s Antiques. An old customer from Munich, who recognised Peppi at a Christie’s sale, accompanied him back to Kensington Church Street. On his return to Munich, he spread the word about the London shop. Many of Peppi’s old customers made the pilgrimage to Theophil’s Antiques.\nPeppi’s substantial income enabled him to donate large sums to causes he considered worthy. He also gave artefacts from his ever-growing collection to museums and art galleries. This service to the public did not go unnoticed. In due course, Peppi was Knighted. Despite his worldly outlook, he savoured the recognition conferred on him in this manner. Lucy, too, was elated. As they walked home after a sumptuous celebration dinner in Peppi’s favourite Viennese restaurant in Chelsea, Lucy said to him smilingly:\n“Well, Sir Joseph-Dieter Freiherr von Stölzenfeld – how does it feel to be a nob?”\n“I only wish that Helga had lived to see this. She would have been delighted – even if she had snorted!”\n“Do you think of her often, Papa?”\n“I do,” confided Peppi. He paused for a moment; “Your mother was the caring type, even if she didn’t always let you see it. I was happy with her.”\n“I know, Papa. But you seldom mention her name.”\n“True,” said Peppi.\n“Perhaps your thoughts are too \u0026hellip; intimate?”\n“I still wonder, Lucy, if she was happy with me,” the words wrenched themselves out of Peppi’s mouth.\n“Why do you doubt it?”\n“Don’t you recall what Anna said to me?”\n“She was way off the mark there. Mother kept praying you’d have a change of heart. But, no, she wouldn’t have wanted you to put on a show for her sake. She hated humbug!”\n“Was she happy, Lucy?”\n“She was content.”\n“What was remiss?”\n“When mother and you got married – were you in love with her?” asked Lucy after a pause.\n“I respected and appreciated her. I knew she would be a model wife!”\n“But were you in love with her?”\n“I was about fifty when we married: not the age of passionate love and romance.”\n“I suspect she wanted it. Mother was a romantic girl at heart. Her tough shell and sharp tongue were a façade. You were her first love.”\n“I showed her as much tenderness as was in me,” said Peppi, apologetic but not on the defensive.\n“I know. Anna and I used to watch you creep into the kitchen in the morning to make mother a cup of coffee, how you always came home with a big smile and, more often than not, with a bunch of flowers or some other token for her, and how you always rushed to help her with the dishes and any other chore.”\n“Did she understand?”\n“Didn’t she ever! Mother used to wake up early, Papa. But she stayed in bed, pretending to be asleep, just because she liked her Peppi to get up first and make her a cup of coffee. She knew you were a good husband; and she was appreciative and contented. But deep down she yearned for the big breakthrough. Still, you mustn’t blame yourself: you gave her everything you could.”\n“I did,” said Peppi.\nTheophil’s Antiques continued to prosper. Despite the onslaught of old age, Peppi retained his drive and versatility. His success was reflected in the steady growth of the portfolios he maintained with his Swiss bank. Occasionally, when he retired to his study to calculate his financial position, he looked in amazement at the figures that stared up at him. For a kid from one of Vienna’s working class districts he had not done too badly; he had metamorphosed into a gentrified millionaire-autodidact with fine achievements under his belt.\nMoreover, his calling was also his hobby – his main passion in his comfortable and robust old age. The only thorn in his flesh was the rift with Anna. In search of solace, Peppi often took his special bottle out of its hiding place and, on experiencing the serenity produced by its elixir, had a lengthy and comforting conversation with his invisible benefactor.\nLucy hoped to reconcile Peppi and Anna. She knew she had to bide her time but she kept her eyes wide open. When, eventually, the opportunity presented itself, she discovered to her dismay that the breach could not be mended. The wound inflicted by Anna had been too deep. Despite his urbane and usually tolerant outlook on life, Peppi had become inflexible on this issue.\nThe olive branch from Bremen came in the form a letter, announcing the birth of Gregory Erwin. Anna confided that they had been trying for a child unsuccessfully for a few years but, at long last, their prayers had been answered. She hoped that Lucy and Peppi would come over for the baptism. It was to take place in Otto’s church.\n“Well, Papa: so I’m going to be Auntie Lucy and you are a grandfather. Shall I book seats on Lufthansa for tomorrow?” asked Lucy.\n“Just one seat,” said Peppi.\n“Papa!”\n“No, Lucy – I’m not going. But you must, of course, go.”\n“But why aren’t you coming with me?”\n“I have no stomach for a Christening! And I think it’s wrong to baptise babies.”\n“Since when have you become so doctrinaire, Papa? Why not treat it as a reconciliation – a family reunion? And don’t you want to see your grandson?”\n“Not in the circumstances!”\n“What’s wrong with ‘the circumstances’?”\n“You better tell me what is wrong with ‘Joseph’ or, if that’s too common a name, with ‘Dieter’?”\n“So that’s the real reason! I never thought you – of all men – would be so petty! Why can’t you accept Anna’s explanation? The baby is named ‘Gregory’ after ‘Gregory the Great’, whom her Otto admires, and ‘Erwin’ is the name of Otto’s father. Don’t you think you are being too sensitive?”\n“No, I am not! Anna has excommunicated me. For years she has given me the leper treatment. She even failed to invite me to her wedding. Frequently, I asked her what the matter was. But she just kept that stubborn silence of hers. Does she think I have no feelings? I may be an old man, Lucy, but I’m not ready to crawl!”\n“But she’s offering you an olive branch.”\n“Coupled with a barb! No, Lucy, don’t argue with me! Anna can call her baby whatever she wants. But I’m not coming; and that’s that!”\n“Why don’t you sleep on it, Papa,” implored Lucy. “I’m not suggesting Anna has done the right thing by you. But there is give and take in life. You used to tell me this in the old days, when I flew off the handle. Do you really want to close the door once and for all?”\n“Anna closed the door on me. And I’m not taking an opening on her terms. But, alright, I’ll think it over. I don’t want to act hastily.”\nPeppi’s painful meditations during that long, dark and sleepless night failed to produce a change of heart. Nor did a conversation which he had early next morning with Theophil. Initially, Theophil refused to become involved. The matter concerned Peppi’s relationship with Anna. To resolve it, Peppi had to make his own decision.\n“Is it a crucial decision?” asked Peppi.\n“It is rather,” replied his friend. “If you fly over, you accept a reconciliation on her terms. If you turn her down, you may pass the point of no return.”\n“Shall I simply send a gift, plus a cheque, accompanied by a letter explaining that my travelling days are over?”\n“I see no need for the cheque. She might see in it an attempt to patronise her. Better send a valuable gift.”\nLucy flew to Bremen unaccompanied. Her hand luggage, though, was heavy. In addition to her own generous gifts, she carried Peppi’s gift: a silver goblet produced during the days of Gregory the Great. In the accompanying letter Peppi congratulated his second daughter warmly and wished all of them well. He went on to explain that his travelling days were over. Still, he hoped to see them ‘one bright day over here in London’.\nLucy returned after three days. Peppi gauged that she liked Otto, was delighted to see Anna once again and had been charmed by little Gregory Erwin.\n“He is so cute, and he has such a lovely smile. But you know what is so very funny?”\n“Well?”\n“Otto is quite a bit like you!”\n“Oh?”\n“He is a big warm hearted sort of a fellow. He is not the aggressive type of clergyman you hate so much.”\n“That’s a comfort,” mumbled Peppi, unconvinced.\n“And, somehow, I don’t think it was his idea to shut you out of their wedding. He asked a lot about you. I think he would like to meet you.”\n“The flight from Bremen to London takes exactly the same time as the flight from London to Bremen,” grumbled Peppi.\n“But I’m not sure Anna is keen on the trip. You turned her down. That didn’t help.”\n“I have resigned myself to not seeing her again,” said Peppi sombrely. “But I do wish I knew what went wrong. Lucy – do you know?”\n“Anna told me – just after it happened. But she made me promise not to tell. And she reminded me of my vow of silence again and again.”\n“So, of course, you can’t tell me. But perhaps you can tell me this much – is it something I did or said? What on earth can it be?”\n“It’s something that went through her mind. You mustn’t blame yourself, Papa. I tried to talk her out of it but it was no good.”\n“Then my only course of action is to dismiss it from my mind.”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-devil-in-munich/chapter-6/","summary":"\u003cp\u003ePeppi arrived in London just in time to celebrate his seventy-fifth birthday.

Turkey It took us just over two years to save enough money. By then, I had nearly finished my pupillage at Jacob Keren \u0026amp; Associates. Pilkin was slogging his way through his course at the Hebrew University and making every effort to shine on the stage.\nSipping a second glass of Cognac in the comfortable dining room in Pension Kegel, I recalled with amusement the unadorned berth my friend and I had taken on a Turkish ship sailing along the coast of Anatolia to Istanbul. It had been a no-frills trip marked by the need to economise. Yet, despite the parsimony dictated by our circumstances, our adventure had left a deeper impression on me than the many high class tours and neatly planned excursions I had enjoyed later on in life.\nIn the ancient port city of Iskenderun, the sight of women in Purdah startled both us. In Israel, the attire (even the veil) had been dropped by Arab girls for years. During the subsequent stops of the ship, we were captivated by the sprawling market in Mersin, although both of us closed our nostrils as we passed by the bags of salted fish, and by the beauty of ancient Izmir. Unexpectedly, we had traversed back in time, from modern and prosaic Tel Aviv to an environment we should have known from our books but which, in reality, was alien. I recall vividly how a taxi driver drove in a remarkable zigzag as we returned to the port from Izmir Peak along the steep and poorly formed road. When, at long last, I managed to convey our concern, he explained he had to proceed in this manner because his car had no brakes. It seemed best not to translate his retort to my bewildered friend.\nWe felt more at home in Istanbul, where Pilkin secured us a room in a youth hostel. After a few hours of rest, we proceeded, as planned, to the notorious district whose fair occupants had contributed so much to the history of the town founded by Constantin the Great. For a while we watched the demi-monde women, smiling at passers by from the windows of their ramshackle houses. Then, as planned, we separated, agreeing to meet ‘later on’.\nPilkin arrived at our rendezvous some twenty minutes later than expected. To my surprise, he was scowling. “Well, how was it?” he wanted to know.\n“Awful!” I admitted. “She did her best to finish me off as fast as possible. It was disgusting – might as well have pulled myself off!”\n“What language,” muttered Pilkin, trying to keep a straight face. “But, Bushi, did you pay straight away?”\n“Well, yes; she told me that was ‘the custom’!”\n“No wonder she rushed you off!”\n“And you? I suppose you got a better deal? “\n“To tell you the truth – not really!”\n“But then what took you so long?”\n“I haggled with her. So she told me all about her drunken father; her sick mother in hospital; her younger sister with her two bastards; her twin brother in jail and her nephew without shoes!”\n“How about her grandmother?”\n“We didn’t get that far! I gave in after the ‘nephew’!”\n“How much did you pay the bitch?”\n“25 lira!”\n“That’s what I paid!” I conceded, adding with a touch of Schdenfreude, “and without a fuss! But what happened after you struck a bargain!”\n“She got me off in a flash. Said she had to visit her sick mother. But she promised me a discount if I came again tomorrow!”\n“Pfui,” said I.\n“Stunk” sighed Pilkin.\n“Might as well have saved our pennies,” I muttered. “Think about it: we work like coolies for two years and then throw the money away on two brainless tarts! Might as well have stayed in tonight!”\n“I am not so sure about that,” said Pilkin thoughtfully.\n“Well, we might have gone to a show or a concert?”\n“But, Bushi, what would our friends say if we hadn’t had a go? They’d call us chickens and worse!”\n“And what will they say when we tell them!”\n“But we won’t tell them the truth!”\n“What do you mean?”\n“We’ll tell them it was exhilarating – a touch of real life!”\n“And next thing is some harmless clods will also get cheated because they believe us?”\n“Just as we made fools of ourselves because we listened to the nonsense of some other yokels!”\n“Oh, very well,” I agreed, thinking that equality was rough justice.\nWe were by then well past the red lights district. Suddenly, a delicious aroma struck my nostrils and the sight of the Shwarma, rotating on the spit in the window of the small Donner Kebab stall, made my mouth water. A swift glance at Pilkin confirmed that he, too, was going through agonies.\n“Well, how about, Mr. Chief Treasurer?” I coaxed.\n“It smells good, Bushi,” he groaned. “But we’ve spent too much money today. We’ll come back tomorrow or the day after. We must be prudent!”\n“I know,” I capitulated and walked on briskly. Initially, Pilkin followed resolutely in my steps. Then, deliberately, he turned round on his heels.\n“Bushi, I dropped my note-book; I’m sure I took it with me. We better look for it. Let’s walk back!”\n“Of course,” I volunteered, although I recalled vividly that, just before we went out, Pilkin had hid his note-book beneath the false bottom of his suitcase. When we were again in front the Shwarma stall, Pilkin succumbed.\n“The hell with money: its smell’s delicious. Let’s have one! We’ll go without lunch tomorrow!”\n“Amen!” said I.\nThe vendor smiled at us sympathetically as we produced our crumpled notes. Taking in my friend’s enormous bulk, he added some extra scraps of mutton to what was, in any event, a generous helping. Munching away with zest, I concluded that gluttony was a sin more rewarding than lust.\nDuring the next few days we went to the museums, to the Blue Mosque and to St. Sophia. All were fascinating. We also took a trip along the Golden Horn and another to the ancient citadel policing the sea route to the Marmara sea. We were, of course, aware that, in modern times, Istanbul did not occupy a place similar to ancient Constantinople. It had long lost its status as one of the major centres of the old world. But, even so, the splendours of the ancient town made us gasp. The porcelain museum, in particular, made me open my eyes wide.\nAlthough we used public transport and took advantage of all discounts available to students, our meagre funds were dwindling fast. The Shwarma and Falafel stalls, the brilliant cafés – each of which appeared quite inexpensive in itself – produced their domino effect. We were perusing our accounts with concern, when my favourite Goddess – Fortuna – sent us her angel, clad as a middle aged, one eyed Turk, with a sharp goatee and a sizeable paunch.\n“You two boys want work?” he asked in broken English.\n“Yes,” said the spokesman, viewing him with overt suspicion.\n“My tour guide is hospital! Porter tells me small chap speak German.”\n“Yes,” I admitted.\n“You now guide. I pay 35 Lira a day and you get tips!”\n“But I know very little about Istanbul!”\n“Here is book for guide. You learn.”\n“And my friend?”\nFor a while Mercury scratched his beard. He then came up with a splendid offer. His ‘Organisation’ was running a gambling joint. Pilkin would be paid 50 Lira a day for acting as scout. If there was any sign of the police he had to take off his hat and scratch his left ear. The policemen were uniformed and so easy to spot.\nWe served our new boss loyally for two weeks. In the process, I acquired an expertise in the history and demography of the ancient capital of Byzantium. Pilkin, in turn, developed into a master spy, with an understanding of Istanbul’s underworld. As we counted our accumulated earnings at the end of the period, we discovered it added up to more than the modest amount we had at the beginning of the journey. Thanking our cycloped benefactor warmly, we promised to be again at his service on our next trip.\n2. Onwards The sense of financial security, prompted me to propose that we take the train to Saloniki. Pilkin exercised his veto. Wealth, he asserted solemnly, should not ‘go to a sane man’s head’! The appropriate procedure was to get free passage.\nMaking myself comfortable in the neat dining room of Pension Kegel – some 40 years after our jaunt – I could not help smiling at the financial prudence accommodated by youth and high spirit. Who from amongst my long line of students – in New Zealand, in Australia and in Singapore – would believe that his grey faced, bald headed, Professor had ever contemplated as undignified an act as ‘bumming a ride’? The truth is that ‘Prof.’ had waited patiently in a queue of youngsters, at the outskirts of Istanbul, until the kindly driver of a goods truck offered him and his portly friend a trip to the desired destination!\nIn the event, Salonika was a disappointment: yet another prosaic town without character. We were equally disenchanted with the Thermopylae. The modern coastline and mountain pass bore no trace of the heroic stand of Leonidas and his Spartans.\nTo my relief Pilkin came to life in Athens. We were relaxing in the ancient amphitheatre, each lost in his thoughts, when Pilkin got up, raised his right arm majestically, and recited without a flaw the sparkling Hebrew translation of a passage from Iphigenia in Aulis.\n“Brilliant,” I said, clapping enthusiastically. “So this is where Euripides staged his plays!”\n“And the stupid Athenians pelted him with mud!”\n“And that fool of an Aristophanes parodied him,” I muttered in disgust.\n“Out of envy – surely,” observed Pilkin, who admired Lysistrata and The Birds.\n“Quite,” I admitted, adding after a pause: “So this is the way to see Athens!”\n“How?”\n“By experiencing the atmosphere and charm of this modern town whilst recalling, when possible, the glory of the past!”\n“I agree,” nodded Pilkin.\nThis sensible orientation stood us in good stead during our days in the Greek Islands, in Corinth, during the short visit to Mycenae and on our trip south to the ruins of Sparta. Then, after a few days in Kalama, we were engaged as crewmen on a freighter sailing to the Bay of Naples.\nBoth of us enjoyed Italy. Notwithstanding his portly expanse, Pilkin joined me on the climb to St. Michele in Anacapri. After a fierce argument, he accepted my views about Tiberius Caesar. With some chagrin, he conceded that an emperor who retreated from the hustle and bustle of Rome to the peace and quiet of this enchanting spot could not have been as evil as depicted in The Twelve Caesars. He grinned when I told him fiercely, that Markus Suetonius was yet another unreliable historian.\n“You are not thinking of Josephus, by any chance. You made a reasonable argument to exonerate him from treason. But wasn’t he unreliable and gullible?”\n“Oh well,” I gave way.\nWe had comparable, political and sociological arguments, as we visited the shrines of Rome, the museums of Florence, the Scala and The Last Supper in Milan and the Piazza St. Marco in Venice. Throughout the inspiring trip, we replenished our ever dwindling funds by securing odd jobs in bars, in restaurants and in other establishment that thrived on the toil of lowly paid transient employees.\nAfter some deliberation we agreed to proceed to our next destination – Genoa – on a night train. To our surprise, the conductor offered us a first class cabin for a small handout. Making ourselves comfortable in this luxurious accommodation, both of us soon fell soundly asleep.\n3. Zermatt When the brusque knocking on the door brought us back into our surroundings, the sun was glimpsing warmly through the window blinds of the cabin. A glance at the watch told me it was close to 8.00 a.m.\n“Quite a long trip for such a short distance,” muttered Pilkin as we munched the sandwiches we had got in Venice.\n“I suppose the train stopped for a while on the way,” I guessed.\n“Maybe,” said Pilkin.\nEven after we alighted, we were pondering about the length of the journey. The mystery was solved when Pilkin, who was looking in amazement at the large lake and fountain in front of us, bumped into a passer by.\n“Salud,” yelled the fellow as he pulled away.\n“I thought ‘Porco’ would be more like it,” commented Pilkin as his protagonist rushed on.\n“Quite,” I agreed, “but, Pilkin, something’s not quite right. Listen to them talking! They speak French – don’t they? And this fountain and lake – do they look like the Bay of Genoa?”\n“Well?”\n“Pilkin,” I said, having just noticed the signpost of the station, “Pilkin – do you know where we are?”\n“Don’t keep poor me in suspense!”\n“We are in Geneva! That idiot in the ticket office confused the issues.”\nFor a few moments Pilkin gazed at me dumbfounded. Then, oblivious to the hostile glances bestowed on us by the seriously minded populace, he burst into peels of hilarious laughter. Before long, I joined in his mirth.\n“So we gave Columbus’ birthplace a miss,” guffawed Pilkin, “and landed in the City of Calvin; not bad – for a pair of ‘greenhorns’!”\n“What are we to do?” I asked when I recovered.\n“Make the most of it, of course,” retorted Pilkin, soothingly. “After all, what’s wrong with Geneva?”\n“Nothing! Except that it wasn’t our destination!”\n“So what? So we’ll put it on our map!”\nFor three days we toured the ancient capital of the French speaking Canton. The Clocks Museum, the Voltaire Museum and, above all, the Art Gallery were alluring. So were the lengthy walks along the shores of Lake Laman and through the old city.\nIt was towards the end of the third day, that I noticed that Pilkin was dragging his feet and, occasionally, slurring his speech. Alarmed, I had a word with the matron in charge of the youth hostel who, we had been told, was a nurse by training. She listened patiently and, after some reflection, suggested the trip must have been too tiring for my friend. She counselled a few days of rest in a quiet, even secluded, place. As neighbouring Montreux was expensive, she recommended we move on to the mountain resort of Zermatt, distinguished by its peaceful atmosphere and by the absence of any motorised traffic except electric cars. She offered to secure us a suitable room at an inexpensive establishment patronised by young mountaineers.\nFor years to come, I had a vivid recollection of splendours of our trip to the Resort – my very first glimpse of the Swiss Alps, of the spreading green valleys and of the snowy peeks high above them. Pilkin and I were enchanted. My own visits in later years underscored my original admiration.\nFor a while I kept thinking of the past. Then the lights of the dining room in Pension Kegel were discretely dimmed. Glancing at my watch, I realised it was well past 10.00 p.m. and that I was the only patron left in the spacious hall. Mumbling my apologies, I appended my initials to the bill. After a short walk to the deserted centre of town, I returned to Pension Kegel and climbed up the stairs leading to my room. In no time, I fell fast asleep.'\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/reunion-in-zermatt/chapter-6/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"1-turkey\"\u003e1.

For all practical purposes he was ready to take my place. He had completed his studies with flying colours, had proved himself as cantor and had delivered a number of sermons after prayer sessions. His style, though, differed from mine. He tended to concentrate on the topics covered by him without adding jokes or plays on words. In reality, his approach was more serious and traditional than mine.\nTo my surprise Avner insisted on a formal ordination procedure: a Semicha. I agreed with him that this formal step was of relevance. Originally, it had been a ceremony in which a panel headed by a properly ordained Rabbi declared the newcomer as fit to resolve disputes brought before him. In this way, the panel confirmed the Rabbi’s ability to adjudicate or make a determination in any matters to be decided on the basis of Jewish law and tradition. In addition, the panel had the power to confirm the graduate’s capacity as a cantor.\nIn our modern era this formal ordination became superfluous. Once a Yeshiva’s student graduated, the course of studies ensured that he had the required skills. Avner, though, took the strict view, under which the studies had to be supplemented by the formality.\nHaving been ordained by a panel headed by Rabbi Margalioth, I could have chaired such a panel; but in view of my close friendship with Shosh (Avner’s mother) I felt the need to engage another chairman. Rabbi Margalioth had become too frail to carry out any procedures. He recommended that I approach Rabbi Mendel Schulman who was at that time in Brooklyn. Schulman looked with satisfaction at Avner’s excellent grades and added that he had been present in a session in which Avner led the Shabbat morning prayers and delivered an address.\nSchulman was satisfied that Avner met the required standard. He added that, in his opinion, Avner would reverse my highly liberal and often debatable determinations. On his recommendation, our panel ordained Avner as capable of functioning as both a cantor and adjudicator.\nWhen the session was over, Mendel Schulman observed that the Hidden Hand that found an acceptable successor to my duties as Rabbi, had not endowed Avner with the gift of faith healing. He thought it advisable that we search for a replacement. Both of us had difficulties in finding such a person. When our search remained unsuccessful, Schulman observed that a Rabbi did not have to be a healer.\nAn additional issue was raised by Yentl. She pointed out that Avner was not in a position to oversee the Foundation. She suggested that the new administrator should be her deputy, a pleasant woman who had worked with her for years. Rabbi Schulman, Avner (now Rabbi Shamir) and I agreed.\nAfter completing all the formalities, Rabbi Schulman asked Avner whether he intended to get married. Whilst there was no law requiring that a Rabbi be a family man, traditionally he had a wife and children. Unlike the celibacy required of Roman Catholic clergymen, Rabbis were not exempt from the duty to multiply. Further, many issues brought for determination to a Rabbi related to domestic affairs. A married man was in a better position to advise or adjudicate than a confirmed bachelor.\nAvner listened to Rabbi Schulman’s words and, I believe, accepted the rationale. A frozen expression alone indicated that he was uneasy. Then he turned to me:\n“Rabbi Loeb, did you tell Rabbi Schulman anything about my experience.”\n“No Avner. I always keep personal details respecting others in strict confidence. You better tell him yourself all about Dina.”\nRabbi Schulman listened attentively to Avner. A sad expression descended on his face when the full impact of the episode dawned on him. For a while he was lost in his thoughts. When his mind was clear, he told Avner that it was fortunate that they had become aware of the facts before it was too late.\n“Look here, Rabbi Shamir,” he concluded. “You are still a young and currently unattached man. You must put this dismal experience behind you. Dina did the right thing when she ceased to contact you. There are many attractive and traditionally raised girls in Brooklyn. I feel confident that you will find one you consider suitable.”\n“It may be difficult for me to fall in love with another woman. I cannot imagine that any would be superior, or in the very least equal, to Dina.”\n“Please, keep the door open until you find a good wife. You know, in many ways things were easier when I was your age. My late father and my wife’s guardian consulted a matchmaker, who thought we were right for one another. I fell in love with her after our nuptials: like Isaac with Rivka (Rebecca).”\n“The days of the matchmaker are long over,” I interceded. “Nowadays we believe in marriages based on love or a sense of compatibility between bride and groom.”\n“I am not sure this is a better approach,” observed Schulman. “Still, I hope that even this new approach will lead to a suitable match when Rabbi Shamir comes across an appropriate girl.”\n“I agree,” I said supportively.\nFor a while Rabbi Schulman looked preoccupied. He then asked Avner:\n“Has Rabbi Zohar told you anything about the crisis I faced a few years ago?”\n“I haven’t,” I explained. Avner looked puzzled.\n“My own son,” Schulman told Avner, “left our faith and became a Roman Catholic. I loved him dearly before then; saw him through college and university. His desertion was a shock. I wanted to remain in touch with him but, in the ultimate, took the step prescribed by our tradition. I have disowned him! I tell you this so as to impress on you the importance of strictly adhering to our laws and tradition.”\n“But he is still your son, Rabbi Schulman. Why did you feel obliged to oust him?”\n“He broke the fifth commandment (Ex. 20:13). He did not respect his father.”\n“How so?” asked Avner.\n“By deserting: by disowning our faith.”\n“I wonder,” countered Avner. “The fifth commandment forbids him to show any personal sort of disrespect. You do not suggest that he did so. The fifth commandment does not apply where his convictions lead him to a path different from yours.”\n“His desertion was as disrespectful as a slap to my face. You, Rabbi Shamir, are still under the influence of Rabbi Zohar’s motto of tolerance!”\n“I respect him as if he were my father,” summed up Avner, “and very often we see eye to eye. I would take a different path if I disagreed with him on any doctrinal point.”\n“Thank you, Avner,” I summed up.\nAvner was now in a position to take over my duties as leader of the congregation. To my surprise, he asked me to remain in office for another two years. Notwithstanding his ordination, he felt the need for guidance. Reluctantly, I agreed. At the same time, I took longer periods of leave. My object was two-fold. To start with, I was keen to spend as much time as possible in Safed, which became our main residence. In addition, I felt that Avner should get used to the idea of being in charge.\nDuring my last year in Brooklyn, I was a figurehead. In reality, Avner had taken over all the duties of a Senior Rabbi. I was pleased that he kept gaining confidence. He still consulted me at times but handled all matters satisfactorily when I was away. Yentl’s resignation from her post in the Foundation meant that our constraints of time diminished.\nMy having taken a back seat in the congregation meant that in some cases I could act without regard to the dignity of my post. One such instance arose when the Jewish and Israeli Culture Club decided that the time was ripe for the staging of a drama. Once again, we tried to spot a suitable piece. After some deliberations, one member of the Committee suggested that we revive Nathan the Wise. Its initial performance had been a success and all of us felt confident that it would again be well attended. On this occasion Avner, who had been elected a member of the Committee, agreed to play the role of the Good Samaritan. Another member offered to take on the role of Saladin. To our disappointment the Chairman advised us that due to other commitments he was unable to perform Nathan. To my own surprise, and acting on the spur of the moment, I volunteered.\n“Are you sure, Rabbi Zohar?” asked the Chairman.\n“I am,” I responded. “Nathan was a wise and tolerant man.”\nOn the way back, Avner expressed his own feeling of unease. He wondered whether the playing of a role on stage was compatible with the dignity and status of an established Rabbi.\n“Normally I, too, would have reservations. The present case is an exception. You see, Avner, for all practical purposes you have become the Chief Rabbi of our congregation. It is no longer my post. Even so, I would turn down roles such as the Malade Imaginaire or Tevyeh. These are comic parts and hence not befitting. Nathan, in contrast, is a sage. His motto is tolerance. This, as you know, is also mine. And bear in mind that Nathan is a dignified figure: a role befitting a tolerant Rabbi.”\n“You did not volunteer on the previous occasion,” pointed out Avner.\n“Abundance of caution! But today the position differs: I am semi-retired. Also you know well that drama and staging are dear to me. Nowadays I can afford to obey the commands of my heart.”\nYentl, with whom I discussed the episode shortly after arriving at home, was supportive. In her opinion, it was proper for me to act in any manner befitting a member of the congregation. She pointed out that this was a charitable act as the net amount left after the deduction of expenses was to be paid into the Foundation’s trust account. She also reminded me that we got acquainted in the course of the staging of Tevyeh the Milkman. She added that the performance of carefully chosen plays contributed to the cause of Jewish welfare in New York. Performing a role on such an occasion differed from an appearance in a commercial ensemble.\nOnce again Nathan the Wise was a success. All seats were booked in each of our ten performances and the audience applauded enthusiastically. The critique, too, was warm. We had favourable reviews in a number of Jewish periodicals. To my delight my own act was lauded. One reviewer observed that it had pleased him to see the role of a sage of bygone days played by a judicious and tolerant Rabbi. I felt that Avner’s misgivings were put to rest.\nDuring my last year in Brooklyn we were busy packing belongings we wanted to send over to Safed. Quite a number of unfinished manuscripts of sermons had to be discarded. Initially I considered giving them to Avner but after further deliberation felt it would be better not to shackle him. My idea was to withdraw from the scene in toto. Yentl was of the same view.\nOne problem cropped up in consequence of Ami’s marriage to a non-Jewess. Ami and Mary, who came over for a visit, wanted to know whether the baby-boy she was carrying ought to be circumcised. My initial reaction was to advise against it. Under Jewish law, the children of a non-Jewish mother were not considered Jewish. They would have to convert in order to qualify as members of the congregation. I took the view that in the case of the offspring of mixed marriages, Jewish rites were out of place. The best approach was to let young people grow up before they made a conscious decision respecting faith. It then dawned on me that the issue was even more complex. Under the strictures of ultra-conservative communities, such children would be deemed ‘mamserim’ and hence could not be admitted into the community.\nTo my relief, Yentl took over. Addressing Mary, whom both of us liked, she asked whether Mary had been brought up as a Christian and whether she would want her children to be brought up as such or simply as secular free thinkers.\n“My parents were evangelical but I became an agnostic during my university days. I believe Ami shares my orientation,” Mary advised.\n“I do,” affirmed Ami. “I only hope you are not offended, Dad.”\n“I am not. Both the United States and Israel are liberal countries when it comes to religion.”\n“And you, Mom?”\n“I am comfortable with my traditional outlook,” Yentl explained. “But I would not force my view on others.”\n“I am relieved,” Ami summed up. “Still, what do you advise as regards our forthcoming problem?”\n“Are you sure it will be a baby-boy?”\n“The gynecologist advised us.”\n“In that case, I advise circumcision. To start with it is hygienic. In addition, if your son decided to convert to Judaism, the issue would not arise: he would already be circumcised. In the case of a baby, circumcision is a small matter. In the case of an adult, it involves a rather unpleasant operation.”\n“I wonder if, as a matter of convenience, I ought to convert,” observed Mary. “Surely, this would sort out the problem.”\n“Conversion to Judaism takes some time. By then, the baby would have been born. It would still be the son of a gentile mother,” I explained.\n“How restrictive,” Mary pointed out. “Is your religion that select? Don’t your Rabbis welcome converts?”\n“Judaism is non-proselytizing. It may be described as clannish,” I conceded. “Follow Yentl’s advice. Have the baby circumcised but bring him up as a free thinker. He is entitled to make his own decision when he is of age.”\n“Would other Rabbis agree with you?” Mary wanted to know.\n“I believe that on this specific point they would see eye to eye with me,” I replied after trying to analyze the problem from Rabbi Schulman’s perspective. “They may even take the stand that, by marrying a non-Jewish woman, a chap like Ami has tacitly consented to his children being brought up in her faith.”\nSix months later, the baby-boy was born. They decided to name him Jacob, to be abbreviated to ‘Jack’. Mary had him circumcised by a surgeon. A Jewish ceremony would have been inappropriate. Little Jack was cute, smiling happily when callers came to see him. My own feelings remained mixed. He was my grandchild but, of course, there was the danger of our becoming estranged, especially if I decided not to travel to America after my retirement in Safed.\nWhen I submitted my official resignation, the congregation arranged a farewell party. Food was plentiful and the wine flowed. Avner delivered a moving speech lauding my contributions to the congregation and to the development of Jewish cultural life in Brooklyn. I was particularly moved when he said that I had been his spiritual guide since we had met in Tel Aviv. For the first time in years I felt that my eyes were getting moist. In my short but direct reply, I thanked all our members for their moral support and expressed my confidence that our ship remained in self-assured and highly competent hands.\nMy days in Brooklyn were drawing to a close. I thought that we ought to keep the large dwelling in Brooklyn. We could either rent it out or simply keep it as a ‘second home’ so that it would be available if we decided to fly to New York from time to time. Yentl’s view differed. Our children had left home and so the roomy residence was getting too big for the two of us. She also thought that it would be unsound to rent it out and use the net proceeds to pay for accommodation in a serviced apartment. Tenants might not take care of our home so that, in the ultimate, the cost of repairs and renovation would deplete our net income from it. In the end, we agreed to sell it and use the proceeds to buy a small flat in Manhattan, to be used when we came over.\nThe flat in Brooklyn, which had been well maintained over the years, was snapped up within a few days. We then had to pack the items we wanted to take with us to Safed. Over the years we had furnished the cottage in Safed to our taste and so we had no use for our New York furniture. Paying for their storage would be wasteful.\nIt pained me to dispose of our comfortable sofa, armchairs and our dining-room set. The second-hand dealers paid us a pittance. We had to accept the price they offered because these items would not fit our newly acquired studio-flat in Manhattan. Still, our Brooklyn residence fetched a good price. We used the balance left after both settlements to have our new holiday apartment renovated and furnished by interior designers.\nThe items we decided to keep were packed by professional movers and sent over to the port of Haifa in a container. From there they would be transported by land to Safed. It was an expensive dispatch and so we selected carefully the items to be retained.\nMost of the books I had acquired over the years had to be given away. The remaining ones, which I treasured, were packed neatly in four huge boxes. They comprised mainly medieval writings of Jewish sages I had collected during my travels. Prominent amongst them was a collection of early editions of Maimonides’ books and a fine copy of the Vilna Talmud. Today, these treasures grace my study in Safed.\nAnother item I insisted that we ship over was Yentl’s electric organ. I was aware that we would have to use an adaptor so as to attach it to the electric current of Israel but this was, really, a small matter. The organ was a gift which I presented to Yentl on our first wedding anniversary.\nI knew that Yentl was attached to it and enjoyed playing traditional Jewish music. Indeed, many of our guests listened with pleasure to her performance of Der Rebbe Elimelech and to some Hebrew songs like Zeena Habanot. Leaving the organ behind and purchasing a new one in Israel seemed the wrong type of economy.\nAnother item we took with us was a magnificent rosewood desk given to me by a member of the community I had helped to overcome the depression that had set in when his wife eloped. The top of the desk, which was made in China, was cherry wood of fine quality. The legs were embroidered with neatly fitted slices of ivory. I believe it was a well-constructed collectors’ item and cherished it. Yentl assured me that we would be able to fit it into my study in Safed.\nOur collection of bronzes – mainly of Israeli origin – was packed into a teakwood chest, which had been presented to me by the congregation in Brooklyn a as farewell gift. Yet a further gift – given to me by Ami – was a mahogany step-ladder used to reach my upper book-shelves. Whilst I had no use for it in Safed, we decided to take it with us. As it was foldable it could be used as a stand for a large Ming-style porcelain vase, which I had picked it up in an auction during a trip to Shanghai. It was bound to adorn our cottage.\nThese items, and two boxes of clothes and religious apparel, filled a small container. In a sense, we managed to transfer the ambience of our residence in Brooklyn to our cottage, which was now becoming our main abode.\nTo my relief, Yentl was looking forward to our change of venue. Although she had been brought up in New York, she became attuned to the Israeli culture prevailing in Safed. She was moving from her old home to her new abode in the chosen land.\nTo show my appreciation I gave her a treat. I knew that during her days in college she took tours to Europe. These whetted her appetite but did not familiarise her with the old Western world. I decided that a five-week break would please her.\nOur first stop was in London. We spent a fortnight in the metropolis. We went to a few shows in the West End, including an excellent performance of The Importance of Being Earnest, took a day excursion to Hampton Court and visited the British Museum three times. We also managed to book a trip up the Thames to Kew Gardens.\nOn another day, we took a trip to Windsor and proceeded to Oxford. We spent a night in The Old Parsonage. After breakfast, we enjoyed visiting the colleges, the Bodleian library and the Ashmolean Museum. In the end, we spent an extra day in the lovely university town, walking down High Street to Magdalen College and back to St. Aldate’s through Addison’s Walk. We took a bus back to High Street and had a pleasant lunch. I could sense how the ambience of this enchanting town reinforced Bushi’s decision to remain in the Diaspora rather than return to Tel Aviv.\nWe then went up to the Lake District and on to Edinburgh. We gave a miss to Glasgow, which had struck me as singularly unappealing when I spent a weekend there on behalf of the Foundation.\nWe took the Dover ferry to Calais and proceeded by train to Paris. I had visited the French capital after Bushi and I spent a few days in Zermatt and so I had some knowledge of this cultural centre. Originally, Yentl and I intended to spend just a few days there but were mesmerized by the French capital’s beauty. We must have been three times in the Louvre, went twice to the Opera and to the Opera Comique and then spent hours in Versailles and Malmaison.\nTo my relief, eating out was not a problem. Just like London, Paris boasted excellent vegetarian restaurants. It grieved me to have to follow our dietary laws and, thus, give a miss to excellent dishes. In the end, we went to one of the synagogues and had some of our meals in the Kosher restaurant. The roast goose was splendid. The meal has remained fresh in my mind. So have the excellent wines we consumed. A visit to the Eiffel Tower was the highlight of our visit.\nWe proceeded via Toulouse to Albi, the birthplace of Henry de Toulouse-Lautrec. My calling proscribed the collection of prints and posters by this outstanding artist, who drew mainly human figures. Hanging his prints in my house would have been a breach of the second Commandment (Ex. 20:4). I had, however, admired the works of the crippled artist from the day I watched the Moulin Rouge in a cinema in Tel Aviv with my boyhood friend Bushi. Visiting a museum displaying Lautrec’s masterpieces was within the permitted parameters of our faith. We spent a day admiring his legacy and then paid a visit to the famed cathedral.\nA trip by rented car took us to Colmar. Yentl refused to make a stop over in Germany and so we took a train to Switzerland and then drove via Lichtenstein and Innsbruck to Salzburg. Both of us liked the puppeteer show and, naturally, spent a day in the Mozarteum. I reflected on the strange vicissitudes of fate. Mozart, who had been shunned in his birth town during his lifetime, had become the cornerstone of its fame.\nFrom Salzburg we went on to Vienna. I had not visited this charming town before. We went a few times to the State Opera and to the Popular Opera. I recall with pleasure the performance of The Magic Flute and Freischuetz in the former and the amusing Bat in the latter. As Yentl did not have a command of German, we attended the English language theatre. She was impressed and – to my delight – asked me to take her to a performance of Amadeus in the Theater in der Josefstadt. We had seen it, in English, on Broadway and so she had no difficulty in following it in German. We also spent a few days in the Art Museum and in the Science Museum. I had seen dinosaur remains in Canada and concluded that the display in Austria’s capital was impressive.\nOn one particularly pleasant day, we went to the famed Belvedere. As both of us were fit, we started viewing the 20th century art displayed in the upper section and walked down, through the grounds, to the Baroque and Medieval collections. It was a most enjoyable experience.\nEating did not present a problem. There were quite a few vegetarian restaurants and we were, of course, welcomed by the Jewish Welfare Board. We also went to the synagogue which had a restaurant. We spent our weekends near the Schul and attended the Shabbat evening celebrations.\nAfter some two weeks in Vienna, we realised that we were running out of time. We feared that our shipped items might arrive in Safed before us. Today – when I am living on my own as an aged retiree – I believe the sensible thing would have been to arrange for the storage of the items upon their arrival. This would have given us the time needed for visits to Budapest, Warsaw and Prague. The latter, in particular, was of interest because of the renowned Jewish quarter. Yentl, though, was getting restive. She was concerned about her organ and, generally, wanted to arrive in Safed.\nWe agreed to travel to Europe in years to come. We wanted to spend a few days in these towns as well as in Granada, Amsterdam and The Hague. Little did we know what lay in store for us.\nHaving made up our minds, we booked a flight to Tel Aviv. On arrival, I contacted the forwarding agents only to find out that there had been a delay of some two weeks in the shipment of our effects. This enabled us to prolong our sojourn in Tel Aviv. My first task was to advise the Schul that I had opted for full retirement in Safed. Accordingly, I had to withdraw from my membership. Here, too, the congregation gave me a farewell party, which was well attended. The evening was enlivened by a small band, which played local music.\nA few days later, Yentl and I had dinner with Shosh and her second husband. I was favourably impressed by him. I was satisfied that the two of them had a good understanding and were a harmonious couple.\nShosh asked a great deal about Avner. For reasons of health, she had been unable to attend his graduation ceremony and his ordination. She was delighted to hear my praiseworthy account of his life in New York. She expressed the hope that, in due course, he would find a dependable wife. I assured her that this was likely to take place before too long. Avner was a good looking and presentable young man and had a good position. Girls would be interested in him.\nA few days later, Yentl and I spent an evening with Ronnie and Galya. I was surprised when Galya often made comments which were out of context. She appeared unfocused and disorganized.\nWhilst Yentl went with her to the kitchen, I asked Ronnie what was the matter. He appeared relieved to unburden himself. In the opinion of their family physician, Galya was demonstrating early symptoms of dementia. I looked at my friend with concern. He looked tired and worn out. With some hesitation, I asked whether he might possibly consider placing Galya in a suitable facility. He replied that, at this stage, he was able to cope. If her condition deteriorated, he might have no other option. I knew that there was no treatment for mental deterioration. All I could do was to sympathize.\nFollowing this sad occasion, Yentl suggested that we proceed to Safed. Our first task was to make room for the effects shipped from New York. A functional desk I had used in our cottage had to be discarded so as to make room for my elegant Brooklyn desk. We also emptied many drawers and bookshelves.\nWhen our things were delivered, they fitted neatly into the cottage. Yentl’s organ became the centre piece. When our dwelling was spot and span, we gave a party to our neighbours. Yossi too accepted our invitation.\nTo my delight, the gathering became a housewarming and we were showered welcome gifts. We received some kitchen ware, interesting DVDs, including one on Masada, and a number of books. One, which I cherish and read very often, was a new treatment of the history of the Jews.\nWhen the festivity was over and our guests left one by one, both of us felt that we really had moved from one home to another.\n15. Our Homely Cottage Yentl and I started life in Safed by making our cottage, which used to be a holiday resort, our headquarters. All in all, we had a reasonably spacious hall cum dining room and another three rooms. One, which had an attached bathroom, was our master bedroom. The second, which used to be a spare room, was turned into Yentl’s room. She kept in it an easel, a cabinet in which she placed her painting materials and her volumes of notes and books on classical composers. The third room had always been my study. It suited me. Yentl kept decorating and renovating it.\nTo my delight she took our departure from New York in her stride. My fear that she might find Safed reclusive was dispelled. I was gratified. After a while we started to take day trips to the main towns in Israel, especially to my hometown, Tel Aviv.\nIn many ways our life in Safed was more harmonious and peaceful than in Brooklyn. To start with, I was master of my own time. The need to arrive promptly for our three daily services – my routine in Brooklyn – was over. If I arrived late for any prayer session, I could slide into the hall quietly and unobtrusively. In Brooklyn the congregation would have awaited my arrival. Further, in Safed members of the congregation occasionally asked for my advice or for help in sorting out their problems. As Rabbi in Brooklyn it had been my duty to assist whenever approached. Here, in Safed, I could avoid such issue and refer the party in distress to the Rabbi-in-charge.\nYentl too had more time for her hobbies. She was no longer involved with the running of a foundation. Like me, she had become an independent retiree.\nA few weeks after our arrival in Safed I discarded my Rabbi’s attire. It seemed more natural to wear ordinary clothes than to retain the black silk garments I donned during my years as the leader of a congregation in Brooklyn. Although Safed boasted a temperate climate it was much warmer than New York, which meant that lighter clothing – such as a jacket or a pullover – were more comfortable than the formal clothing I used during my years of service. Naturally, I wore a scalp cap or a hat but, then, these were commonplace in my new abode. In a sense, I became a member of the crowd, a position that suited me. I also acclimatized to my social environment, spending many afternoons and evenings with Yossi, who was keen to discuss political and sociological questions. My old debating skills, developed during my long-gone days in Tichon, stood me in good stead in our encounters.\nSome four months after our settlement in Safed, Ami and Mary paid us a visit with little Jacob. We had a sumptuous welcome dinner and, acting on a whim, I decided to invite Yossi who had become a close friend.\nWhen we were taking the dessert – a dish of Zimmes (which could be taken after a meal regardless of whether it was ‘dairy’ or ‘meat-based’), Mary addressed me:\n“Tâte,” she started, “I wanted to tell you and Mom that I have converted to Judaism.”\nI gasped. Mary’s use of the Yiddish word ‘Tâte’, which had the same meaning as ‘Dad’, startled me. As she had not been brought up in our faith and ambience, her use of a Yiddish expression was unexpected. Her having converted was yet another surprise. Ami was secular and, I felt certain, would not have asked his wife to take such a step.\n“What induced you?” I wanted to know. “Surely, Ami never suggested this.”\n“I didn’t,” interceded Ami.\n“Did you want your entire family to identify with one faith?” asked Yossi.\n“The very question I wanted to ask,” observed Yentl.\n“This was one of the considerations,” explained Mary, “but there was a further and more important reason: I have come to believe in our religion. You see, I was brought up in an Evangelical house and went to a school that was so orientated. I knew how much Christianity owed to Judaism.”\n“Historically, Christianity developed from one of the sects of Judaism. Probably early Christians broke away from the Essenes. Some scholars maintain that the roots of Christianity are in the sect of Qumran that left us the Dead Sea Scrolls,” pointed out Yossi. “It is widely accepted that John the Baptist was a member of the sect. One researcher maintains that St. Paul stopped in Qumran on his way to Damascus.”\n“For a hardened agnostic, you are uncommonly well versed in the development of religions,” I sneered at my friend.\n“The understanding of the background of doctrines you deny enables you to stand your ground,” he replied.\n“Yossi is right,” averred Yentl. “But, Mary, don’t you think that Jesus Christ was an innovator?”\n“In a way, he was. He told us that God loves all humans, and that one ought to love one’s enemy,” agreed Mary.\n“In that case, why do you prefer Judaism?” Yossi wanted to know.\n“Because it is the cornerstone. Further, the tenets of Jesus are not pursued by his followers.”\n“I agree with Mary. Jews stick to their tenets and their traditions. Their clannishness is also their strength.”\n“How were you converted?” I wanted to know.\n“A Reform Rabbi tutored me and his congregation accepted me.”\n“Do you realise that your conversion may not be recognised by orthodox congregations?”\n“I do; but this does not matter to me. Ami and I attend the sessions of a Reform congregation. In many ways, we adhere to the core far more than the orthodox sects. And please call me ‘Miriam’; I prefer it to ‘Mary’.”\nHer spirited reply brought our conversation to a close. It seemed to me strange that this young and forthright woman had taken a step which might have estranged her from her parents. Was this – I kept reflecting – yet another manifestation of the Hidden Hand that controlled our lives? Yossi, I knew, would regard the episode as a manifestation of sheer coincidence. Was it possible that his was the more plausible explanation?\nAmi and Mary (now to be addressed as ‘Miriam’) spent three weeks in Safed, occupying Yentl’s room. Before their return to the United States, Ami told me that he had launched a new venture with a colleague and asked whether I wanted to acquire a share.\n“I don’t think so, Ami. All ventures carry a risk and I have learnt not to take any. Your Mother and I are in full agreement on this point.”\n“I expect it to be a success, Dad.”\n“I hope it will be.”\n“But, Dad, at this stage we need an input of capital.”\n“How much do you need?”\n“About $20,000.00. Can you perhaps lend me the money?’\n“I can’t raise so much. But I can give you $5,000.00. You’ll have to find another person who is prepared to take a risk.”\nShortly after our guests departed, Yentl told me that she wanted to sleep on her own. I was stunned but managed to keep my composure.\n“Why, Yentl?”\n“Loeb, as you know I am a light sleeper. Normally I go to bed an hour or an hour and a half after you. You snore so that quite often I cannot fall asleep and remain awake for a long time.”\n“Why don’t you come to our bedroom when you retire early and use your room when you continue to work after I switch off?”\n“That’s a good idea,” she agreed.\nInitially, I found this new arrangement disturbing. I was used to waking up beside Yentl. It gave me a feeling of confidence and a sense of proximity. Still, during my years in office I had often traveled on my own. My existence on such trips had prepared me for having a bedroom of my own. In a sense, I now reverted to my existence during my youth.\nOne consequence of my retiring before Yentl was that, invariably, I woke up before her. When we shared the same bedroom, I used to wait until Yentl woke up. Our new arrangement enabled me to get up, walk over to the kitchen and prepare breakfast. At the beginning, Yentl resented my intruding into the kitchen. She regarded it as her domain. However, Yentl like poached eggs but often overcooked them. My preparation of the dish was superior to hers. After a while, she accepted that, during the morning, I was in charge.\nAs she was an excellent chef, I did not venture into her province later in the day. I always looked forward to the lunch and the dinner she prepared. In this regard I could not compete with her. Some of her chicken dishes have remained fresh in my mind. So have the Goulash, the dumplings and the stuffed cabbage.\nOur first two years in Safed were commonplace. From time to time we drove over to Jerusalem, Haifa and Tel Aviv. Usually we called on friends and acquaintances and had an interesting and pleasant time. On one occasion we spent a few days in Acre. The excursion to the Crusaders’ underground city was exciting. Whenever we went to Jerusalem I visited the Hall of the Shrine, which housed the Dead Sea Scrolls. I spent hours reading those on display.\nOur existence in Safed was lively. On one occasion Ronnie came over after having placed Galya in an institution. I sensed that looking after her had become too heavy a burden. On another occasion Shosh and her husband called on us. We took them to see the Luria Centre and spent some time in the Schul. I was glad to hear from Shosh that Avner had met a nice girl from a good Jewish home. They were going steady and intended to get married before long. Ruth, too, flew over and stayed in Safed for some five weeks. She brought her children with her. Her husband was unable to accompany her but Ruth brought with her a set of photographs. I was pleased to glean that the whole family was happy and that although their business had not flourished it was doing reasonably well.\nI thought that I had brought my ship home when I received a sad letter from Ami. His business enterprise had failed and he was facing financial difficulties. He had found another opening – a fresh venture – and asked me to participate. After a lengthy discussion, Yentl and I decided to sell our flat in Manhattan which had soared in value. I gifted some of the proceeds to Ami and invested the balance in carefully chosen bonds and shares. As we no longer flew to the United States, the sale was timely. Keeping an empty flat seemed wasteful.\nShortly after Shosh’s departure we received an invitation to Avner’s wedding. I was keen to fly over and rent a serviced apartment for some two weeks. Yentl’s view differed.\n“Look here, Loeb, Avner regards you as a father figure. He is used to seeing you dressed like a Rabbi and leader. He may be nonplussed by your new demeanour. Send him a nice letter and a handsome wedding gift. This may be more appropriate than attending the occasion as a layman.”\n“But Avner knows I have retired and am leading a quiet and secluded life, doesn’t he?”\n“He does. But knowing is different from seeing. He may feel that his idol has feet of clay.”\nAfter some reflection, I took Yentl’s advice. We sent Avner a befitting gift and a pleasant letter, in which I invited him and his wife to visit us in Safed.\nLife continued to flow smoothly. I spent a great deal of time studying the Kabbala and reading the Zohar. To my disappointment I had to concede that even this monumental work did not throw much light on the nature of God. Like other milestones of Judaism it accepted the existence of God and his vigilance of mankind as an a priori premise.\nMy lively discussions with Yossi did not clarify the issue; his was an agnostic approach, which tended to explain our existence and nature without reference to a superior being. After a while I saw the logic in the system preached by him. Basically, he opined that we existed because we did. He did not explain our lineage. He thought that it was adequate to accept the obvious.\nYentl did not participate in our discussions. She adhered to her traditional approach, which she had adopted during her childhood. She felt comfortable with it and saw no need to embark on further investigations. I concluded that her upbringing ruled her throughout life.\nI would have been happy to continue our harmonious and carefree existence. Then, unexpectedly, I had a rude wake up call. One bright morning I carried the breakfast tray to Yentl’s room. I was sure she would like the Musli (to which I had added an extra helping of raisins, which she favoured) and the poached eggs accompanied by smoked salmon and pickled cucumbers. Seeing that she was still asleep I thought it best to leave the tray beside her bed and come back after some fifteen minutes. She was bound to wake up by then. Poached eggs, though, need to be consumed right after they are cooked. The thought of their getting soggy disturbed me.\nWith some hesitation I approached Yentl’s bed hoping she would open her eyes as I approached. Then, to my surprise, she remained still. As I came nearer I realised she was not breathing. She remained immovable even after I called her name, touched her and then shook her lightly. It was only then that it dawned on me that she was gone. Dropping the tray on her bedside table, I rushed to the telephone and called our GP. When he arrived out of breath after some twenty minutes, he confirmed she had passed away. Her heart had stopped beating.\n“How on earth did this happen?” I asked him. “I never expected to outlive her.”\n“Your wife, Rabbi Zohar, suffered from arteriosclerosis. Last year I wanted to send her to a cardiologist in Tel Aviv, who might have recommended stents. She declined and asked me to give her tablets.”\n“She didn’t tell me about it.”\n“Didn’t you know she came over for consultations?”\n“I thought she had some woman’s ailment. I asked her if everything was well. She assured me it was nothing serious, just a trifle.”\n“Actually, she asked me not to tell you. As you know, the relationship of patient and physician is confidential. I was obliged to respect her wishes.”\nIt added up. Yentl knew she was ill but decided to hide her condition. She feared making a fuss. Still, by moving out of our bedroom, she prepared me for the lonely existence I was bound to experience following her demise.\nBoth Ami and Ruth flew over for the funeral, which took place two days later. Shosh and her husband drove up and so did Ronnie Eyal. Quite a few of our friends in Safed attended. Avner, who must have been informed by Shosh, sent me a lengthy consolation email. Representatives of the Foundation and two members of my Schul in Tel Aviv were able to arrive in time. All in all, many familiar faces were to be seen.\nThe ceremony was conducted by a Rabbi of my acquaintance. Being the only son, Ami was asked to say the blessing, which was recited after the brief prayer. To my surprise and dismay he broke down as he recited it. I had seen Ami crying when he was a child but knew that in his adult life he was invariably in command of his emotions. Ruth cried quietly whilst I managed not to shed tears.\nThroughout the ceremony my thoughts traveled to the past. I remembered our wedding, our happy times together, our breaks and trips and, generally, the support she had given me during our many years as a couple. The Bible tells us that husband and wife become one flesh. My happy and lasting marriage to Yentl was in accord with this maxim. She did all she could to make me happy. Life without her seemed bleak and dismal.\nAfter the funeral, family and close friends attended the traditional meal given to calm the bereaved relatives. As we stood around waiting for the first dish, Ami approached me:\n“I am ashamed to have made an exhibition of myself,” he told me.\n“You didn’t, son. I have attended quite a number of funerals in New York. Often people break down. I suspect it the realisation that a person you have loved is no more.”\n“But you know, Dad, mine were not tears of pain but of deep shame. I had done little to please her.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“Mom was not pleased when I became secular and then married out.”\n“You needn’t feel any guilt on that score. Yentl was worldly and understanding.”\n“She wanted me to study medicine; that was her dream!”\n“Yentl knew full well that you had to plan your own future. So don’t blame yourself for a misdeed you never committed.”\n“And what will you do, Dad? Miriam asked me to invite you to live with us.”\n“I’d rather stay put, son: in Safed where Yentl planned our home for my existence as a widower.”\n“I understand, Dad. But the invitation is there whenever you want to come over and join us.”\n“Thank you,” I told him.\nThe meal was an anti-climax. We talked about Yentl’s achievements: her role in the Foundation and her hobbies. Yossi, who had joined us, talked about the splendid meal she had prepared whenever he came over. We then, as if by consent, talked about the ambience of Safed and about Israeli politics.\nAfter the meal, Ruth came over and extended to me an invitation similar to Ami’s.\nYet she was not surprised when I told her I had decided to remain in Safed.\n“I thought that was going to be your plan. Mom and you were very close.”\n“Quite so, Ruth. I prefer to remain in Safed. I propose to visit her grave frequently. I was happy with her and cannot bear the idea of leaving her grave unattended.”\n“I can understand you,” she told me. “But you can come over and visit us from time to time. I hope you will.”\n“I’ll think about it,” I promised her, suppressing words indicating that my travelling days were over.\nIt took me a while to get used to my existence as widower. I continued to sleep on one side of the double bed although I was, of course, aware that she would no longer slip in from time to time. Out of habit I used only the right bedside table. Yentl had used the other and it seemed inappropriate to utilize it for myself. Another oddity was the preparation of breakfast for two. However, before long I discarded this wasteful process and started to take mine in the kitchen.\nYossi visited me regularly. On many occasions we played chess. Both of us were average players so I lost some games and won others. On many such evenings we discussed philosophical and sociological issues of the day. I recall how we discussed the SARS outbreak in 2003. Both of us took an urbane attitude based on the assumption that the pandemic was unlikely to spread to Safed.\nOne evening, after I had won a match, I asked Yossi to tell me a bit about himself. Whilst I knew him from his days in the army and was aware he had been a psychiatrist, he had never discussed his personal life with me.\n“Well,” he said, “there is not a great deal to tell. After serving my time as a houseman in Hadassah in Tel Aviv, I practised for a while as GP.”\n“What made you turn to psychiatry?”\n“It dawned on me, during my years in practice, that many patients’ complaints were mental rather than physical. After a while, I started to specialize. In due course fellow practitioners started to refer patients to me when they sensed that the problem was of a mental type. When my reputation grew, I decided to devote myself to the discipline.”\n“I became renowned as a faith healer,” I grinned.\n“Tell me about it,” he asked.\nYossi listened attentively to my account. He grinned when I mentioned how members of the congregation asked me to pray for them or bless them, and how I used my influence to induce them to change their orientation – for instance, to switch from resentment of others to understanding.\n“You talked your ‘patients’ out of their irrational or untoward demeanour. I used to prescribe placebos instead of medications they were hoping to get. Still, there were extreme cases, such as anxiety or mortification, where I had to prescribe medicines such as valium or anti-depressants.”\n“I had to refer some of my ‘patients’ to psychiatrists I trusted.”\n“Just as I referred some to their Priests or Rabbis,” he grinned. “In reality there are many occasions in which faith healers like you and medical men like me have to complement each other. Oh well.”\n“Tell me a bit about your personal life,” I prompted him. “Occasionally you must have been tempted by some female patients.”\n“Not really,” He told me. “You see, I have burned my fingers. I adhered to an ancient maxim: once bitten, twice shy. And I was scorched twice.”\n“How comes?”\n“My first wife, Miri, did not feel as passionate about me as I for her. Somehow, the chemistry was not right on her part. I suspect that if I had let her boss me, she would have remained with me. When she found out that this did not work and lost interest in me, she left and shacked with another girl. Her elopement made me feel inadequate. I remained on my own for some three years.”\n“And your second wife? How did you find her?”\n“She was a psychiatrist – like me. I met her through contacts. You see, I was her second husband. Both of us wore battle scars and so became tolerant. We were happy together.”\n“So what went wrong?”\n“She died of a neglected flu. She told me, on her deathbed, that I was not easy to handle. She asked me to marry again only if I found a wife who would put up with ‘my nonsense’. I heeded her warning. In the event, I remained on my own. And I am content.”\n“Do you know what happened to your first wife?”\n“We are not in touch but I was told that she and her partner retired in Nahariya.”\n“In Nahariya?”\n“So I am told. Why do you ask?”\n“Do you know her partner’s name?”\n“I’m not sure. She was the business manager of a theatre ensemble.”\n“Signon?”\n“Quite so.”\n“So I know your first wife’s partner well. She was my boss in Signon. She lived with her secretary, Miri. Was this Miri your first wife?”\n“Quite possible,” he muttered.\n“Strange: my boss, Nina, could be fierce and unbending but occasionally Miri had to step in and extricate her. I was told that in their personal lives, Miri was dominant.”\n“It sounds like my first wife. She liked to be in control.”\n“How strange that so many years later we find a remote connection. I met Miri when I came to see Nina. And yes, I know for certain that Nina and Miri retired in Nahariya.”\n“Oh well,” Yossi summed up.\n“What a strange coincidence,” I observed after a pause.\n“I am glad you do not seek to see here the intervention of ‘a Hidden Hand’.”\n“I am an observant Jew but not a fanatic,” I protested.\n“Quite so. Fanatics may assert some divine involvement. You see, both of us were married twice and experienced the loss of a good wife. We now keep company or, in other words, each of us helps the other to cope with the feeling of a void. So, in the eyes of fervent believers, the Good Lord showed His kind hand.”\n“In that case, why didn’t He save us the grief?”\n“The ways of the Good Lord are not comprehensible to us, mere humans! But He is aware of everything that takes place, don’t you know this?” Yossi mimicked a pedantic preacher explaining the ‘basics’ to his congregation.\n“I never assumed this sort of doctrinal and authoritative demeanour when I addressed my parishioners.”\n“That’s what I thought. But, then, you must concede that your approach was not a typical one. Occasionally, I suspect that you had your doubts about dogma.”\nIt seemed best not to proceed. I went to the kitchen to prepare a snack and asked Yossi to put the pieces back on the chessboard. Both of us concentrated on the game and, as if by agreement, did not revert to the subject we had covered. Deep in my heart, though, Yossi’s final words kept reverberating. He had struck an echo. Did I have doubts throughout my entire odyssey?\nDuring the following few days I kept reflecting on Yossi’s words. At the same time, I had to tackle the reality facing me. I had a fine cottage with three rooms. Initially, I thought it best to leave Yentl’s room unchanged. I then recalled Dickens’ Miss Havisham, who kept her house as it was on the very day her groom deserted. I felt certain that Yentl would not have expected me to follow suit. Her approach to life was pragmatic. She accepted events the way they came. She would not have wanted me to keep a room consecrated to her memory and hence out of bounds.\nAs my needs were met by my keeping the master bedroom and my study, I turned Yentl’s erstwhile room into a guest room. Yentl’s organ had to be given away. As Miriam Porat dreamt of having one but could not afford to buy it, I gave her Yentl’s. She was pleased and promised to play the music which had been cherished by my late wife. I then bought a double bed and two side tables and used them to refurnish the room. I could now accommodate a couple and, if needed, I could convert the bed-sofa in the sitting room to yet a further bed. I now was able to put up an entire family, such as Ami’s or Ruth’s. I felt confident that Yentl would have approved.\nSome two months after I completed the last renovation, Shosh wrote to advise that she and her husband had decided to spend a few days in Tiberias and were thinking of visiting me in Safed. In my reply, I encouraged them to come over and offered to put them up. Shosh accepted.\nWe spent some three days together. I took them to the Kabbala synagogue. Both were impressed. They liked the ambience of our town and the mild summer climate. Before their departure, Shosh observed that she was perplexed to gather that I had been frequenting the Kabbala Schul. She had expected me to adhere to my moderately orthodox orientation.\n“The Kabbala tries to explore issues not covered by my stream. I have remained open minded and am prepared to listen to any views which do not require me to depart from the essence,” I explained.\n“I have wondered all along what you considered ‘the essence’. Don’t you ever doubt some of the strictures?”\n“I’m rather set in my views,” I replied defensively.\n“But, in that case, why do you flirt with marginal concepts?”\nIt seemed best not to reply. Shosh had come close to exposing a dent in my spiritual armor. She did not press the point and so we stuck to small talk during the ensuing dinner. Next morning they continued to Metula. Before their departure, Shosh observed that I frequently scratched my beard. I told her it had become very itchy, especially as I had not trimmed it since Yentl’s demise.\nA few weeks after Shosh’s departure, I invited Ronnie Eyal. He came over for a week. He recovered from the strain he had manifested before Galya was moved to an institution. By and large, he became – once again – his old self. After visiting the sights, I raised one evening, over dinner, the issues raised by Shosh as regards my spiritual outlook.\n“Look here, Chayim…\n“Loeb, as I told you before, but my close friends use my nickname: Pilkin…” I interceded.\n“Very well, Pilkin, but don’t take offence at what I am going to say.”\n“I won’t,” I assured him.\n“When you worked in Signon we saw a great deal of one another, didn’t we?”\n“We did.”\n“And you knew I was an agnostic or, in plain words, a disbeliever. You also knew I was Jewish. All the same, you never tried to influence me. Correct?”\n“Indeed. I accepted you as you were. Many of my close friends fall into this category. I like them for what they are and, of course, each of them is a decent person. None of them impinged on my faith.”\n“And you have always been closer to people like us than to ultra-orthodox believers.”\n“True! Fanatics appall me; and most ultra-orthodox Jews are intolerant.”\n“And you find this offensive, don’t you?”\n“I do, rather.”\n“I suspect, Pilkin, that you are getting the drift. The fact is that when we became close, I started to wonder whether you were simply born into a traditional home or adopted your moderately observant outlook after searching for the truth.”\n“The former, Ronnie. But this ambience suited me.”\n“I know. Still, if you were born into an evangelical home you would not have become an observant Jewish believer.”\n“This may be so,” I admitted.\n“Similarly, if you had grown up as a free thinker, a Christian preacher might have converted you to his faith.”\n“True, or I may have rejected his indoctrination,” I replied.\n“You might have doubted the truth he asserted,” Ronnie appeared agitated.\n“Quite so,” I assured him.\n“All this leads me to wonder whether you might have rejected Jewish thinking if you ever came to doubt it. Well, Pilkin, perhaps it was fortunate that you never doubted it.”\nRonnie’s words rattled me. During my long odyssey I felt comfortable with my tolerant and non-dogmatic stance. I had no reason to doubt it. At the same time, I felt no affinity for the firmer, often intolerant, faith of other Rabbis. Mendel Schulman and I were miles apart. Unlike him, I could accept the orientation of a son, who did not follow in my steps. Was my lenient approach incompatible with the tenets of our faith? Was my broadmindedness akin to apostasy?\nRonnie left after two days. My orientation and outlook were not discussed any further. Still, his observations gave me food for thought.\n16. An Aged Retiree During the next few months I re-read Zohar, the opus magnum of the Kabbala. I knew that the sect attributed the work to Rabban Shimon Bar Yochai, who founded the Yavneh school during the decades following the destruction of the Second Temple by Titus Caesar. The book, though, included Portuguese words. This convinced me that the version we possess was composed at a much later date.\nI realised that the Zohar was profound and detailed. All the same, it failed to open new doors to my searching eyes. Our religion’s essence remained enshrined in some difficult passages in the Tanakh (Old Testament). I had accepted our norms unquestionably in my youth and never sought to find a rational explanation for the tradition I followed. My intellectual curiosity arose when I retired from my active and often stressful existence. The Zohar did not clarify the issues.\nMy interest in finding the rationale of our faith kept me so occupied that my interest in staging plays and in acting suitable roles waned. In a sense, this was natural. I had become a retiree.\nYossi visited me regularly. We played chess and philosophized. It was clear to me that he had formed his conclusions about my outlook and belief but had decided not to raise the subject again. However, he observed that I kept scratching my face.\n“When Yentl was around,” I explained, “she insisted that I trim my beard at least once a month. The itch wasn’t so bad; at least not for a week or two.”\n“Then why don’t you trim it nowadays?” Yossi wanted to know.\n“Oh, I simply can’t be bothered.”\n“If the beard keeps troubling you, why don’t you simply shave it off?”\n“What would people say? Won’t they be shocked?”\n“I don’t see why. Is there any Biblical command respecting the growing of a beard?”\n“Not really. It is simply a matter of tradition. A Rabbi is expected to have one.”\n“But you are in retirement, aren’t you?”\n“Quite so! Still I am a Rabbi.”\nYossi did not persevere. A few days later the itch became unbearable. Having reflected on his words and bearing in mind the old maxim that risk to body and soul overrides Shabbat, I decided to have the beard removed.\nThe barber’s apprentice, who had come to know me well, looked at me incredulously. He then went to consult his boss. The latter came over and asked me whether I had really requested a shave off.\n“Quite so,” I told him\n“You didn’t mean ‘to trim’, did you?”\n“No. I want a clean shave.”\n“Very well. But it will take a while. You have a long beard. It must have taken you years to grow it.”\nI saw no need to reply. After some twenty minutes I had a good look in the mirror. The neatly shaved face looked unfamiliar. Was it really mine?\nIn the evening Yossi came over for a chess match. As we sat down, he scrutinized me thoroughly.\n“That’s the countenance I recall from my days in the army. But you had a younger face in those days.”\n“The clock keeps ticking, Yossi. You too have aged.”\n“Of course; but I had never grown a beard and so did not hide myself behind it.”\nOn the following weekend I took a bus to Tel Aviv. Ronnie had no difficulty in recognizing me. His only comment was that I looked younger and less formidable without a ‘camouflage’. He then took me for a visit to Galya. She seemed to have come to terms with the institution which housed her. To my surprise, she did not recognise me. She assumed that I was one of Ronnie’s new friends. It pained me to think that my ex- wife forgot that I had played a role in her life.\nRonnie looked somber and deflated as we left the place. I thought it best to try to console him.\n“In the very least you don’t have children,” I told him.\n“Why is this good?”\n“It might have been difficult to induce them to come to terms with the situation.”\n“True; but as matters stand I am on my own; I have nobody to turn to.”\n“I know; but, then, nobody cries on your shoulder.”\n“Well spoken; but, to tell the truth, sometimes it is tough to be bonded to a wife who is no longer the woman you married. Your lot – as an aging widower – is easier to bear. I am certain you have only good memories of your years with Yentl.”\n“True,” I replied; “but I miss her badly.”\n“Why don’t you talk to her spirit? She may respond.”\nRonnie’s words made sense. I was, of course, aware that death was terminal. Nobody came back from that last trip of his or her life. Occasionally, though, the spirit of a departed echoes in your mind.\nOne evening, a few days after I had settled back in the cottage, my mind heard her voice.\n“Loeb, why are you so glum?” she wanted to know.\n“Is it really you, Yentl?”\n“Who else, Loeb? Surely, there is no other woman in your life or mind?”\n“Of course not! But, you are no longer here. How, then, are you able to talk to me?”\n“But I am here, Loeb. I exist in your mind. My body is gone; but my spirit is part of yours.”\n“I think I understand,” I conceded.\n“Well then; so why are you morose?”\n“I was used to sharing my ideas with you, Yentl. And we enjoyed having our meals together.”\n“You’ll have to partake these on your own. But you can still share your thoughts with me.”\n“Just now I ponder whether I should ask Ami or Ruth to come over for a visit.”\n“Why not ask them both in turn?”\n“But which one should I invite first? I’ve tried hard not to have a preference between them. A good father loves Esau as much as Jacob. Still, Ruth was always closer to me than Ami.”\n“In that case invite Ruth and her family to come over for a spell.”\nRuth arrived on her own. I should have liked to see my grandchildren but they had to attend school. I tried hard to hide my disappointment but I believe she noted it.\nAmi came for a visit a few months later. Mary (now Miriam) came with him and brought little Jack along. We had a wonderful time. I showed them the sights and we drove over to Metula. We did not proceed to the Golan Heights but returned to Safed via Haifa. Ami told me that his new enterprise was doing well and that his dreams of a notable success would materialise. I had my doubts but did not disclose them to him.\nLittle Jack was a self-assured boy. He knew what he wanted but, fortunately, his demands were reasonable. One of his acquisitions was a toy elephant on which he could ride and which trumpeted when one pulled a cord attached to its head. Sighing, Miriam said they would take it with them as unaccompanied baggage. The shipment was bound to cost more than the toy but, then, Jack had set his heart on it. Ami took a photograph of Jack astride his elephant and me standing beside him and smiling happily.\n“I wonder who is more content,” he observed when he showed me the snap.\n“The onlookers?” queried Miriam. “Surely, you and I, Ami, were as happy as grandfather and grandson.”\nA few days later Miriam guided me on another matter. We went for a walk during a hot summer morning. After half an hour all of us were uncomfortable. Noting that I perspired more than the rest, she asked whether I was unwell.\n“Not really, Miriam: I’m just feeling very hot.”\nLooking me over carefully, she asked: “Why are you wearing a vest on a day like this, Tate?”\n“It’s not a vest, Miriam. It’s my prayer shawl.”\n“A prayer shawl under your shirt? The Rabbi who instructed me on Judaism told me that a large prayer shawl – a talith gedola – need be worn only during Shacharit: our Morning Prayer.”\n“True,” I explained, “but just in case you forget or lose it, you have the alternative of wearing a small shawl under your shirt. I have done so for years.”\n“But on such a hot day? Why don’t you discard it and use the large shawl over your clothes when you say Shacharit?”\n“Actually, you are right,” I conceded.\nThereafter I stopped using the small prayer shawl. When I went in the morning to the synagogue to say the Morning Prayer, I used a large shawl worn over my clothes.\nTo my delight, Yentl approved. A few nights later, when I woke up shortly after midnight, her voice told me:\n“You, Loeb, are strict on yourself but liberal when others seek your guidance or advice.”\n“I know; but, then, I am a Rabbi.”\n“Wrong tense, Loeb: you were a Rabbi. Nowadays you are a retiree. So be a Mensch even where you yourself are concerned.”\nYentl’s words convinced me. I was doing the right thing though, possibly, on the wrong basis. As Rabbi I had to set a good example. I wore the small talith next to my skin. As a retiree, who led the life of a hermit, I could follow customs in a broadminded manner. By using the large prayer shawl when I recited Shacharit, I observed the liberal tradition I had advocated to members of my congregation. In my present life, it suited me and was proper.\nAnother problem arose from my laying tefillin (phylacteries) every morning before reciting the Shacharit. The relevant verses in the Bible (Ex. 13:9,16; Deut. 6:8 and 11:8) command the People of Israel to put a sign on their hands and between ‘your eyes’ to commemorate the Exodus miracle and the laws given by God. This led to the tradition involving the ‘laying’ (or wearing) of two small rawhide boxes (8x8x8cm.) during the Morning Prayer on all days of the week except the Shabbat. Inserted in these boxes are the above passages written on parchment by a qualified scribe. Both boxes are fixed to the body with leather. The box for the hands is placed on the left upper arm and the strap is wrapped around the upper limb and down to the left-hand fingers. Our tradition requires that it be fastened tightly.\nMy tefillin were one of my Bar-Mitzvah gifts. I have put them on regularly each and every weekday morning, except the days of hospitalization following my heart attack. I managed to lay them even just before our battle of Latrun and even when I was travelling. I recall one amusing incident that occurred when I took a flight from New York to London. Just before we were served breakfast, I took off my jacket in order to lay my tefillin. As I was winding the hand-strap, the flight became bumpy and I had to sit down and fasten my seatbelt with the half-wrapped phylacteries on. The airhostess looked at me with concern, shook her head and brought me a glass of water. I drank it, waited until the plane steadied, got up and continued the traditional proceedings. When I finished praying, she came over again and asked whether I was alright. She looked relieved when I assured her that all was well. I then dug into the Kosher meal she served me.\nI used my Bar Mitzvah tefillin during my years in Israel and in New York. Shortly after my ordination, Rabbi Margalioth gave me another set of phylacteries. They were a deluxe version, made of softer leather. I accepted them gratefully but, out of habit, continued to don my original set. I cherished my mentor’s gift and treated the new set as a treasure, to be used only on special occasions.\nThe position changed after my retirement. Shortly after Yentl and I settled in Safed, I caught a severe chill and felt the need of seeing a physician. When I rolled up my sleeve to facilitate the taking of my blood pressure, Dr. Cohen viewed with concern the bruising left by the phylactery on my arm.\n“Do you have to fasten the strap so tightly?” he wanted to know.\n“If you don’t, the box may slip down your arm.”\n“I understand. But, then, you told me you had a heart attack – caused by a thrombosis – in your youth.”\n“True. But what should I do? I am used to laying my tefillin.”\n“Try to fasten the strap less tightly or get one made of softer leather. You are on blood thinners! They exacerbate bruising.”\n“I have a set of deluxe tefillin. I’ll use it in the future.”\nYentl approved and so I started using my deluxe tefillin regularly. For a while the bruising ceased but eventually it started afresh. When I went to Dr. Cohen for my annual checkup he looked at my arm with unease.\n“I cannot reduce your blood thinners. You need them. At this stage, the laying of the tefillin is becoming dangerous. As your medical adviser, I have to draw your attention to the problem. You see, at your age you are bound to have some narrowing of the arteries. Your cardiogram indicates that you have moderate arteriosclerosis. You are taking a risk.”\n“But I am used to laying them,” I muttered.\n“You must make your own decision, Rabbi Zohar.”\nIt was a difficult issue. Laying tefillin had become part of my life. Was I to change my pattern at this late stage? When I was a Rabbi in New York, one of our disciples held classes for members of the congregation who required instructions respecting tefillin. How on earth could I cease following a Mitzvah – a religious obligation – which had been close to my heart for decades?\nAs I sat pondering the issue, I suddenly heard Yentl’s spirit talking to me.\n“Loeb, what sort of advice would you have given to one of you congregants if he had raised the problem with you during your long years of service?”\n“I would have told him that danger to the soul and body overrides even a Shabbat. The final decision would be his.”\n“But if he persevered, what sort of advice would you give him?”\n“I should have exempted him or, in other words, I should have told him that he was no longer obligated to lay tefillin.”\n“Why, then, don’t you give the same advice to yourself?”\n“But I am no longer in office. I cannot exonerate myself.”\n“Then why not discuss the matter with someone whose opinion you trust?”\nMy first choice would have been Rabbi Moshe Margalioth. I then thought about Avner, who had succeeded me in Brooklyn. However, I was senior to him and sensed that in view of his youth and the close relationship between us, it would be best to exclude him. It was advisable to turn to an older person. In the event, my choice fell on Rabbi Mendel Schulman. The current Rabbi of the Schul advised me that Mendel, who was in his nineties, was living in his daughter’s house. He still came for prayer from time to time and had remained mentally alert.\nMendel Schulman was glad to see me. For a while, we engaged in small talk. Then he asked me, smilingly:\n“What good spirit directed you to me?”\n“I wanted to see you and ask your advice on a delicate matter.”\n“Let’s see if I can help you.”\nMendel Schulman listened attentively to my query. His eyes opened wide when I showed him my bruised arm. His first query was whether I had considered buying deluxe tefillin. When I assured him my set was of this kind and that it was Moshe Margalioth’s gift, he looked at me with concern.\n“So the tefillin remind you of him and the years you spent as his right hand man?”\n“This too, of course. Originally – I mean as from my Bar Mitzvah – I used my first plain set. I switched to my new ones only when the old set was cutting into my arm. And now even the softer leather is bothersome.”\n“Actually, Loeb, why do we lay tefillin? What do they convey?”\n“Laying them is part of my life. The meaning is clear. They remind us of the miracles HaShem made when he delivered us from slavery in Egypt. When we put them on, we think about HaShem’s greatness and we bless him.”\n“Precisely,” he confirmed, “and we bless him in our morning prayer. I am sure you recite it every morning, don’t you?”\n“Of course. Occasionally I even repeat the Amidah, which praises Him 18 times.”\n“We have the old, venerated, principle which tells us that risk to soul and body overrides even a Shabbat: which is holy to us. On this basis, you are no longer obliged to put on tefillin.”\n“But this would leave a void in my life. The ritual has become part of my daily life.”\n“You could still put on the head phylactery.”\n“That would be strange and, in any event, it would take only a few seconds.”\n“And so the emptiness would still be there,” he summed up. “But look, I have an idea. Why don’t you read appropriate passages of our Bible as soon as you wake up? How about Psalm 119. It blesses HaShem and recites his greatness.”\n“I don’t like this Psalm, Rabbi Mendel.”\n“Because it is the longest chapter in the Tanakh: a work of 176 lines?”\n“That’s not the reason. Its structure is alien; it is an acrostic. Its verses follow the order of our alphabet and each letter has eight lines.”\n“Which of our Psalms do you like best? Let me guess. Is it by any chance Psalm 104?”\n“Spot on. Poetically it is superb and it venerates HaShem.”\n“Are you particularly fond of any other passage in our Tanakh?”\n“I love Ha’azinu (Deut. 32 1:43),” I told him.\n“Splendid, I too love these gems. I suggest you give the tefillin a miss and start your day by reading or, when you have memorized them, by reciting these two monumental passages. Both tell us that HaShem is great and just.”\nMendel Schulman’s advice was sound. In point of fact, I already knew the two poetic works by heart and so decided to recite them each morning in lieu of the laying of the tefillin. I thanked him.\nIt then seemed appropriate to remind him of his rigidity in previous years. With some hesitation, I asked whether he had remained estranged from his son.\n“I no longer regard him a rascal. A few years ago I succumbed to an attack of pneumonia and had to be hospitalized. Baruch – now known as Father Benedict – flew over out of concern. We had a heart to heart talk after I recovered. Ever since, I have treated him as a son. I believe he is errant but I have accepted the situation.”\n“How did he know you were so sick?”\n“Dahlia, my daughter, has been in touch with him all these years. She cabled him.”\n“I am glad you are reconciled,” I told him. “Notwithstanding your different views about religion he has continued to treat you as his father. I sense that he loves and respects you. Our religion would regard him a renegade. Love, though, overrides all sins.”\n“It does,” he conceded.\nYentl’s spirit was supportive. She concluded that Mendel Schulman had sorted out my problem. It also pleased her that father and son had reunited.\n“Occasionally, we agree to disagree,” her voice told me. “Family unity should not be disturbed or interrupted because of divergent views on religion or politics.”\nA few days later I had a chat with Yossi. He was relieved to know that I had decided to stop laying tefillin. He had noticed the bruises on my arm one morning when we went for a walk. He had meant to talk to me about them but decided to keep quiet. Basically, he felt that this was not his business. An additional reason related to his reflections on my odyssey.\n“What is so special about it?”\n“You rose from obscurity to fame and then took a back seat.”\n“Is that so unusual?”\n“Perhaps not in itself. Many success stories follow this pattern. However, your journey is special in one regard.”\n“In what way?” I wanted to know.\n“In the variety of the roles you assumed.”\n“Eh?”\n“Early in life you became your family’s bread winner. In Tichon you became a central figure …\n“… with the aid of two friends: Bushi and Shosh,” I interspersed.\n“Undoubtedly, but without your lead they would have simply remained part of the crowd: pupils in your Form in secondary school. They needed you to lead them. You in turn benefited from their support and friendship. In the army you became both an entertainer and a fine officer. In Signon you failed to gain an acting role but you became Galya’s supporting angel. You were her caregiver and helped her to find her way to stardom. You then became in quick succession a highly respected and liked teacher, the founder of a club interested in books and dramas, a cornerstone of the ITV and then reverted to your studies in the Yeshiva. When you graduated you became Moshe Margalioth’s right hand man and thereafter a famed Rabbi in your own right. You then retired and melted into the background.”\n“What is so extraordinary about all this? And aren’t you forgetting Yentl’s role?”\n“I am certainly not overlooking it. She helped you along the way. But your journey is special. Most people stay in a given discipline, like painting, writing, composing music or business. You changed your role several times.”\n“What does this indicate to you?” I asked genuinely perplexed.\n“Your real passion in life was acting, wasn’t it?”\n“It was,” I conceded. “I always sought to have my foot in the door of the theatre.”\n“This leads me to the conclusion that throughout your life, regardless of the twists and turns of your odyssey, you have remained an actor. Your stage was the world: not a mere space on the front of a theatre hall.”\nYossi’s words rang a bell. He made me think of my first day in the theatre – when Mrs. Kornmehl introduced me to the actor who played Sapper Vodichka in The Good Soldier Schweik. I gleaned from him that every actor refurbishes the roles he plays and, in a sense, interprets the text. Did my general outlook on life remain unchanged throughout my lengthy trip?\n“Yossi,” I asked my friend, “did I then assume roles bestowed on me? Was I an actor who, when needed, played a role such as an officer or Rabbi?”\n“I think so,” he told me unflinchingly.\n“Okay; but was there a common thread – a system to my play acting?”\n“There were two. In the first place, you liked – still like – to help people who need aid or guidance or who rely on you …”\n“And the second?” I asked as he stopped himself.\n“You remained ingrained in tradition. Ritual became part of your life.”\nI looked at Yossi with amazement. It was true that throughout life I strove to assist others – my neighbours. But was my traditional outlook merely a mantle? Was I bonded to ritual or was I simply a moderate believer? I had prayed daily since youth, had worn a prayer shawl and laid tefillin. Were these just a camouflage?\n“I can’t be sure,” replied Yossi when I raised the point. “Speaking as a psychiatrist, I would conclude that your adherence to ritual was anchored in your survival instinct. You needed to feel safe and the traditions you adhered to enhanced your sense of security.”\n“So you don’t think it was a genuine belief in the fundamentals?”\n“I can’t be sure. Reflecting on my spell as a trooper in your unit in the army, I believe your urge to protect and confer a sense of security on others was more basic to you than dogma.”\n“What view do you take of my conversations with Yentl’s spirit?”\n“Objectively seen, they are hallucinations. You know that a person’s voice dies upon his or her demise. To me, your need to air points with your late wife’s spirit suggests that you have a limited trust in your own outlook and analysis.”\nYossi’s words struck a chord. My traditional outlook was not the fruit of reflection or of a search for truth. I followed the precepts because of the manner in which I had been brought up. I inherited my late Father’s orientation, which, in turn, was an acceptance of the norms followed by his predecessors. My preoccupation with the Zohar and my reading of many philosophic works indicated that right from my childhood I kept pondering. Unflinchingly, I recalled my final disappointment with the Zohar because it was entrenched in myth and failed to provide a rational exposition of the fundamentals.\nShortly after Yossi departed I heard Yentl’s voice. It was loud and clear and appeared to come from an external source.\n“Loeb,” she asked me, “Loeb, do you agree with Yossi’s conclusion?”\n“I can’t be certain, Yentl. Many of my friends are agnostics or non-conformists.”\n“Weren’t Moshe Margalioth and other believers close to you?”\n“They were. And religion bound Avner to me. Still, I did not disown my son when I thought he might leave the fold after marrying out.”\n“In other words, you were a liberal Rabbi and you remained observant throughout life. Tolerance, though, was your motto. When others took a different view of life, you concluded that they were entitled to their opinions. But you retained yours!”\n“I did. Still do, I think.”\n“You alone know the answer,” she told me.\n“Am I hallucinating?”\n“Of course not. My spirit dwells in you. You are conducting an internal dialogue.”\n“You were always a good wife to me!”\n“So I was Loeb. The plain truth is that I set my heart on you. I made the choice and throughout your life guided and spurred you on.”\n“Please explain,” I pleaded.\n“I made sure you would become the Chief Rabbi of our congregation. I realized that handling the Foundation’s affairs would have been an extra and too heavy a burden. So I took over and remained in charge of it until your retirement.”\n“You did me proud,” I assured her.\n“I hope I did. So don’t waste your time now on dissecting your personality. The real question is: did you achieve your goal?”\n“With your help, I think I did.”\n“And the rest – I say – is irrelevant.”\n“And how about my loss of interest in drama and staging?”\n“But it is not a plain loss. You continue to read the works of great playwrights. The other day you read Major Barbara.”\n“I did not dream of staging it.”\n“You didn’t: I know this. But your present interest in plays and literature befits a retiree.”\nYentl’s words explained my change of attitude. She soothed me. The main issue, though, remained unanswered. Did I simply play the roles conferred on me, or was I motivated by religious convictions and by the need to carry out the obligations faith imposed on me? Was I a genuine believer or a free thinker wearing the cloak of religion?\nA few weeks later, Shosh and her husband came over for a short visit. After a pleasant dinner in a Kosher oriental restaurant I mentioned the issue that kept troubling me. Shosh was taken aback. She took the view that I had struck a clear course of tolerance and liberalism throughout my life. Whether I was a genuine believer or a free thinker was – she observed – irrelevant.\n“Did you regard me an observant Jew or a free thinker?”\n“You wore a Yarmolka and observed our dietary laws. As far as I was concerned that was a clear indication of your being an observant Jew; and I sensed that you were a traditionalist. At the same time, I noted that you never tried to influence the orientation of Bushi and of myself. And you knew we were free thinkers.”\n“But, surely, ours is a non-proselytizing religion?”\n“It is true that we do not seek to convert gentiles. Our religion is exclusive. Still, most orthodox believers try to influence ‘errant’ Jews. You didn’t. I always sensed that moderation and the willingness to accept others as they were constituted your basic creed.”\nAt this stage, Shosh’s husband, who was known by his nickname of ‘Jonas’, stepped into the argumentative arena. Initially, I was surprised. Jonas was one of those tight-lipped individuals, who prefer to leave the floor to their wives. It then dawned on me that Shosh had touched a sore point.\n“Shosh is right, Rabbi Zohar,” he told me. “When I served in the army I befriended two observant troopers. They looked askance when I told them I had never laid tefillin or prayed. They tried hard to convert me; but to no effect. During our years as recruits they remained friendly with me.”\n“Well?” I asked\n“When I contacted them after we finished our years of service, they were invariably too busy to see me. After three or four attempts, I gave up.”\n“I am not sure why this disappointing experience is relevant,” I told him.\n“Because they tried hard to make me ‘see the light’. They tried to indoctrinate me. An observant Jew accepts a gentile as he is; but he seeks to influence other ethnic Jews. So the non-proselytizing nature of our faith applies only in respect of non-Jewish persons.”\n“I agree with Jonas,” added Shosh. “And you, Pilkin, never preached to Bushi or to me. In your case, liberalism and moderation applied across the board.”\nShosh and Jonas departed after a few days. Before they left, Jonas gave me a bulky volume encompassing Ibsen’s plays.\n“Shosh tells me you love dramas. So do I. A volume of George Bernard Shaw’s plays is one of my cherished possessions. I devoted a great deal of time to his writings during my school days. I passed my examinations but without any distinction. As you know I went to the Max Fein technical school. During my years as locksmith, I continued reading and watching plays. I gather from Shosh that you love Ibsen but that you are no longer interested in staging plays.”\n“True,” I told him, “and many thanks for the gift.”\n“Enjoy reading or re-reading them. I can understand that, as a retiree, you no longer have the wish to stage these plays.”\nLife flowed smoothly for the next few years. Ruth came over again. Ami rang me from time to time. Occasionally, I went to Tel Aviv, mainly in order to see friends and so as to visit my old Schul.\nAbout a year after Shosh’s visit I rang Bushi Berger. I had corresponded with him sporadically ever since our reunion in Zermatt. Bushi knew I was a widower and I was aware that his Chinese wife was terminally ill. After polite enquiries, I raised with him the issue respecting my internal doubts about religion.\n“Look here, Pilkin, does all this really matter?”\n“It matters to me! Was I a fraud?”\n“Of course not! Religion is a complex issue. It will surprise you to hear that even I – old heretic as I am – attend our local synagogue from time to time. In some two weeks, I’ll attend the Seder – the Passover Feast – in the house of a good friend.”\n“But Passover was initiated so as to remind us of the Exodus. I thought you didn’t believe it had taken place.”\n“In everyday life, I don’t. As you know, I think the Israelites were indigenous Canaanites. Still, I recall how our teacher in Tichon made us read an article entitled Moses by Ahad Ha’am. Perturbed by archeological evidence, this renowned essayist postulated the distinction between an archeological truth, based on modern findings, and a historical truth, based on the tradition or folklore we embrace. During the Seder and when I attend a service in the synagogue, I accept the historical truth. Back at home, I revert to the archeological findings.”\n“The issue of whether I am genuinely observant or just wear a mantle does not disturb you. Does it?”\n“Of course not. It is a red herring! You were a good and helpful fellow. That is why quite a few of us befriended you. Your religious make up did not – does not – concern me.”\n“Let us give further consideration to the issue when we next meet.”\n“But, Pilkin, both of us are aged men. In all probability, my travelling days are over and, in any event, I have no wish to visit Israel. Are you likely to visit me? You’ll be most welcome.”\n“I doubt it,” I told him. “I may spend a few days in New York but the chances are that I shall stay put here in Safed. Let us continue to stay in touch by phone and by mail.”\n“Very well. All the best to you, Pilkin. I look forward to talking to you again soon.”\nBushi’s words soothed me. I accepted his analysis.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novels/bright-lion/part-5/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"14-move-to-safed\"\u003e14.

Years later, when we had returned to Singapore, I felt the need to clear my mind. My occasional talks with Tay Fung-Shuo, which I had during my first period in Singapore, threw no light on the episodes respecting Ranjan. Tay had remained tight lipped and, as soon as decorum permitted, changed the subject, usually by leading the way to some newly discovered antique porcelain.\nOn those occasion, when I had been a guest in his shop, he was entitled to remain taciturn. But ever since his Harlequin Doppelgänger – Alfie – had urged me to write a candid account of Ranjan’s life, I had the right to have his comments on any issue respecting Ranjan’s life. One evening, when Pat was glued to a lengthy Chinese programme, I had the opportunity to discuss the issues with him.\nAlfie welcomed me with his usual grin. It spread over his face as soon as the elegant porcelain figurine metamorphosed into my old friend, wearing his traditional silk suit.\n“You not laugh my no hair, Mr. Mid-Yeast Tourist,” he teased. “Yours also gone long time ago!”\n“Don’t rub it in, Mr. Tay,” I protested.\n“Today me Alfie! Yes. Also in our language. Today you come ask about Ranjan, Lillo and Lydia. Is all your friends; and also me your friend. So today be formal silly!”\nI was, of course, aware that the image displayed in front of my eyes was illusory. The real Alfie had been dead for years. I was conversing with some hidden corner in my own sub-conscious mind – a corner now imbued with Tay Fung-Shuo’s intellect. To me, though, the porcelain Doppelgänger was real.\n“So why not clear my vision, Mr. Know All Alfie?”\n“You ask question. When clear, I think answer.”\nStep by step I raised my queries about Ranjan’s two romances. Lillo had been beautiful, presentable and madly in love with him. She would have been a good wife, an excellent hostess and a show piece. His society at home would have accepted her with open arms; and his career was paramount in her eyes. And all her money would have been at his disposal. Lydia, too, was beautiful and presentable; but she was not wealthy. In addition, her independent nature and gift of repartee could have put obstacles when he was winding his way through the corridors of power.\nI had no doubt that Lillo would have been the more suitable spouse. Yet he had jilted her and, later on, wanted to tie the knot with Lydia. What had induced him to reach his two decisions?\n“You ask before – in my shop. I not want to discuss because you and I, we talk art, porcelain, sometime history also literature. This, I think, is different problem. Is real life.”\n“Is so; but, Alfie, art, history, literature is life.”\n“Of people you not know. Ranjan, is friend. But, never mind, today we investigate. But first you tell me: you yourself, what you think is Lillo.”\n“Beautiful and smart girl; princess!”\n“You think you want her?”\n“I think every man want … take out?”\n“But marry – you think you want?”\n“I not even dare ask! I not her class!”\n“But if she ask?”\n“Perhaps not, Alfie,” I admitted; “and – of course – she my friend’s girl.”\n“But if not so; and if you know her well?”\nAt that point I saw light. Lillo was tantalising. Any normal man would dream about an affair with her. She was bound to keep his interest going. Apart from her good looks, she had personality. Men loved to watch her holding court. But would many of them take the next step and propose?\n“Good marriage, what means” asked Alfie, who had been following my trend of thought.\n“Companionship; understanding, same interests; and, of course, what we call chemistry?”\n“But you think Lillo can give all to Ranjan?”\n“Why not?” I prevaricated.\n“But you yourself not sure if you want be lucky man? So why?”\n“When I first see I admire; but then I see Lillo so dependent; want be part of everything – so is demanding perhaps is possessive, very possessive.”\n“And Ranjan – is he independent man?”\n“Is.”\n“So perhaps he also afraid; and, you tell me, he make Lillo think one day he judge – aloof member of clan; not member of crowd.”\n“And a politician must be – or pretend is – one of public.”\n“So perhaps here problem. When Ranjan court Lillo, he give her wrong impression; and then is afraid tell truth. Also perhaps is afraid he lose independence; lose free choice.”\n“So why not talk girl?”\n“This cannot know. Perhaps he get ‘cold feet’; not want show own weakness or admit lie: who know? And is also possible Lillo demand too much attention; and Ranjan want freedom.”\n“But why did he run away like that?” I reverted to plain English.\n“Big boy great coward,” retorted Alfie. “Some great leaders fear wife and wife’s tongue; or fear tears?”\n“And the money?”\n“Greed,” summed up Alfie. “Not nice!”\n“Why then did he propose to Lydia; she was far more independent than Lillo?”\n“He was older and wiser by then.” Tay followed my lead into plain language. “And perhaps he sensed he could handle Lydia because she, too, was a Sinhalese.”\nAlfie’s analysis provided a possible answer. One puzzle, though, remained. More than a year had passed between Ranjan’s desertion and my unexpected meeting with his discarded fiancée. Time was a great healer and Lillo was a beautiful, highly spirited girl. Initially, she had survived Ranjan’s defection. What had induced her to commit an act of folly months later?\n“Perhaps was chance of see you?” ventured Alfie. “And then you not go visit her!”\n“Surely not reason,” I protested. “You not think Lillo dream about Yokel like your good friend, Mr. Mid-Yeast Tourist!”\n“Now, now, my friend,” Alfie chided. “You not Yokel; some girls, they like you; even if Lillo thinks you like brother!”\n“So why she see me important?”\n“You bring back loss of her hero; also perhaps you say something? And she think you want avoid more on issue.”\nHis words jolted my memory. Just before her new boyfriend – Joseph X – had burst in on us, Lillo had asked whether I thought Ranjan might eventually return to her. Unthinkingly, I had told her – plainly – that Ranjan was not one to retrace his steps. She must have concluded that I implied that hers was a case of spilt milk. My failure to call on her must have driven the message home. She gathered I wanted to avoid any further reference to the matter. My reaction to Joseph, too, was plain. Lillo must have gathered that I regarded him a nonentity. I made her focus on her loss and, unthinkingly, told her it was irrecoverable. Did she lose her remaining hope for a bright future? Was my encounter with her the unfortunate last straw?\n“So now you understand, my friend” said Alfie.\n“I am afraid I do; and you right!”\n“Must be; if so you say,” he smirked.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/a-candid-obituary/chapter-6/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eDuring my years in Wellington, I often soliloquised about Ranjan’s life.

Moving to Religions “Welcome back from your trip to the East,” observed Tiger as we returned. “What have you achieved?”\n“I punched the greatest tyrant in history and he appreciated my act.”\n“He must have been a smarty.”\n“He was!”\n“But you are still in pre-historic times. You know little of that period so that Eve, Herodotus and Qin Shi Huang are readily selected. How will you find appropriate nominees in periods known to you from history classes?” asked Archie.\n“We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it!”\n“I agree,” opined Archie, “but now is the time to select the field of interest. You see, you punched the mother of mankind, the father of history and a super-tyrant. The three were central to human destiny. What will be the next area and its heroes?”\n“My teacher in secondary school took the view that religion was central to humanity. A colleague of mine in New Zealand referred to mankind as Homo Religioso. Recent research suggests that even the Neanderthals had some rudimentary form of creed. This explains the burials that have been discovered.”\n“Seems a fair choice,” opined Archie, who was reclining comfortably on Moti’s huge trunk. “All the same, you have a problem. Your panel decided that divinity was out of bounds. If you accept Christianity, Jesus Christ is not legible; but if you do not accept it, Jesus Christ has been a mortal. He therefore comes within your parameters. Similarly, if you do not adhere to a pagan religion, their gods are – from your point of view – mere mortals. Wouldn’t you like to punch Venus or Vulcan?”\n“Bacchus is far more appealing,” I retorted, “but I don’t think he had an everlasting effect on humanity. Most drunks succumb without worshiping him.”\n“How about the Buddha or Kông Füzî (Confucius)?” asked Tiger.\n“They did not initiate new religions but, rather, preached a way of life,” I pointed out. “Neither claimed to be divine.”\n“I agree,” said Archie. “Actually, most religions survived only if an able leader spread the word!”\nHis observation gave me food for thought. Akhenaton preached a form of monotheism, based on treating the sun disk as the only god. His faith, though, perished with him. Similarly, some sects of Judaism – like the Sadducees – disappeared altogether. We read about them only in Josephus’ works and in the Mishna, which disliked them. I concluded that the spread of religion depended mainly on the preachers’ skill and perseverance.\n2. Opting for St. Paul “I agree with Archie,” observed Tiger. “Your best course, Peter’le, is to decide which faith is the most wide-spread and investigate who was its leading preacher.”\n“The most populous religion is Christianity,” pointed out Moti. “Islam comes close but the followers of Christ are more numerous.”\n“Does this hold true in all recent epochs?” I wanted to know.\n“I have no statistics preceding the middle of the 19th century,” conceded Moti. “Still, as we don’t regard Buddhism a religion, Christianity seems to take the lead since it spread.”\n“In that case the answer is clear. Jesus Christ is the founder. Regrettably, he died on the cross. Further, most of his apostles concentrated on spreading the word to their brethren in faith. Sha’ul of Tarsos, commonly known as St. Paul, constituted himself the apostle to the nations. He traversed the Middle East and made converts. His credo is best illustrated by the Letter to the Romans. In my opinion, he was the greatest! It is true that Christians were persecuted even after his day. He did, though, inspire later adherents. Eventually Emperor Constantine was converted to Christianity and made it the religion of the Empire. The seed of Christianity’s success in the Roman Empire, though, was sewn by St. Paul. Perhaps it was unfortunate that no Roman Roads stretched into the Arabian Peninsula. If they had, St. Paul might have traversed them as preacher and converted the local population. As it happened the area was converted, seven centuries later, to Islam by Muhammad.”\n“Then you have your man, Peter’le,” summed up Archie. “Actually, I am impressed. May I accompany you?”\n“By all means,” I assured him. “Be my guest on this occasion.”\n“But there is one remaining problem. St. Paul had a long odyssey – leading from Tarsos to his sad demise in Rome. I can appear to him during his confinement in a Roman prison. By then he had completed his work. But there was a much earlier turning point is his life. He was sent from Jerusalem with an assignment to persecute the Christian sect in Damascus. On his way he had a revelation, which metamorphosed him from a prosecutor to an adherent. Should I call on him on this occasion?”\n“Did his full potential materialise on that occasion?” asked Tiger.\n“Not really. It was the start of a new journey, a journey which led to his remarkable attainments.”\n“In that case,” summed up Archie, “he was not as yet worthy of a punch. You better attend to him when his time on earth was drawing to its close.”\n“I doubt if he, himself, appreciated his place in the history of mankind during his lifetime,” I mused.\n“True,” replied Archie. “But that applies to each of your punchees.”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novels/nose-puncher/part-7/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"1-moving-to-religions\"\u003e1.

In this monologue, Job narrates his tragic story.\nIn chapter 29 he expounds his standing prior to the bet of God and Satan. The first part of the second verse, correctly translated reads: “oh that I be restored to my heyday”,1 has become a phrase in use in modern Hebrew. Job then tells us all about his uprightness and his exalted status before his fall. He says: “I put on righteousness, and my justice clothed me, as a robe and diadem” [29:14]. He sums up by stating: “I …sat as chief, and dwelt as king in the army …” [29:25]. This assertion is borne out by the prologue which describes him, inter alia, as “ … the greatest [wealthiest] of all men of the East [1:3].”2\nIn chapter 30 Job describes his fall. In the first verse he tells us that he is being mocked by younger people “whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with dogs of my flock.” He adds that even these people abhor him and spit in his face [30:10].\nAddressing God, he complains: “I cry to thee, and thou dost not answer me. I stand up, dost thou then regard me? Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hands thou opposest thyself against me [30:20-21].3 By way of contrast, Job refers to his own virtue. He says: “Did I not weep for him that was in trouble? Was not my soul grieved for the poor? But when I looked for good then evil came…” [30:25-26]. He concludes: “I am a brother to jackals, and a companion to owls. My skin hangs down black from me, and my bones are burned with heat. Therefore my lyre is turned to mourning and my pipe4 to the voice of those who weep” [30:29-31].\nHis decency and strict observance of good behaviour are expanded in chapter 31. To start with, he affirms his decency and exclaims: “If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot has hasted to deceit; let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know my integrity” [31:6].5 He gives details of his caring attitude to widows, orphans and the fallen and concludes “[if]f my land cry against me or its furrows complain together; if I have eaten its fruits without money, or have caused its owners to sigh: let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley”[31:38-39].\nHere Job affirms his innocence by way of oath and pleads his case. From a legal viewpoint, his concluding monologue resembles a ‘case stated’. In essence, he maintains that he has been wronged and avers that he is entitled to a reply. To this end, he says: “Oh that one would hear me! Here is my mark, let the Almighty answer me! And would that my adversary would pen his writ” [31:35].6 Job does not deny God’s superiority and omnipotence but asserts his right to question His justice (the “theodicy issue”). On this point, he is, of course, borne out by the prologue.\nThe last verse of the chapter reads: “The words of [Job] are ended” [31:40]. They differ from the monologue, in which Job speaks and, accordingly, his words are expressed in first person. The concluding phrase, in contrast, is an editorial comment, expressed in third person. Here the Compiler/Editor tells the reader that Job has completed his discourse. Notably, a portion of it is preserved in the Qumran Scroll.7\nThe epilogue [42:7-end] is in harmony with the poetic part ending in chapter 31. It does not refer to Elihu’s speeches (caps 32 – 37) or to Gods Replies from the Whirlwind (caps. 38 – 42:1-6).\nThis leads to the conclusion that in the original version of Job, which has not come down to us, Job’s bitter reproaches are not favoured with an answer. If this analysis is correct, this original version would have had to be suppressed as being apostate. Nonetheless, this conclusion is appropriate: it will be recalled that Job’s sufferings do not constitute a befitting punishment for his sins. They are the outcome of a mere bet between God and Satan, a bet won by the latter. Is it possible that the translations destroyed by Gamliel, were copies (or translations) of this original version?\nContextually, too, the proposed analysis is sound. It will be shown that neither Elihu nor God’s Replies from the Whirlwind come up with an answer to the main query raised in Job: the theodicy issue. Job’s concept of She’ol (the afterlife) is discussed hereafter.\nUsually translated as “Oh that I were as in months past”; in Hebrew: “מי יתנני כירחי-קדם”.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThere is here a play on words. “Men of the East ]קדם[” can also mean: “men of antiquity”.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nCp.

He listened attentively to my narration but, all in all, took the story in his stride.\n“Were you surprised that Seddon was none other than Jack the publican?”\n“I was, rather. My image of Albert Seddon, the manipulative con man, is miles apart from my respect and affection for Jack. He has been good to me.”\n“But, Mr. Berger, how much did you really know about Albert Seddon, the somewhat shady character?”\n“Only what I gleaned from the case and, in addition, what Jack has told me.”\n“And, initially, you couldn’t associate that manipulator with the publican. I understand. But then, are the two incompatible? Are they necessarily two separate persons?”\n“Obviously, they aren’t. We are talking about one and the same man but in very different roles. But aren’t the roles inconsistent?”\n“Not if you place each in its own context.”\nI looked at him intently. Actually, my knowledge of Dennis Gray’s life outside the city was scanty. I knew he was married and that his two sons were cadets in the foreign trade departments of two leading banks. He had also mentioned that his older daughter had set the date of her wedding. All the same, I had no idea of Dennis Gray’s life at home and as a family man. For instance, was he a handy man? What were his favourite sports? Did he like to watch old films?\n“Most of us position people where we first meet them. To you, I am Dennis Gray, the London banker. Things got complex in your relationship with Seddon.

The well-dressed man standing next to you in the tram in Vienna may be an actor, a banker, any type of businessman or, possibly, an experienced con man or a serial killer.

Part Payment The Hendra affair did not disrupt my good relations with Norbert and Freddie. And strangely enough, the tension between them eased. In a sense, the affair brought them together.\nHendra remained a thorn in the Bank’s side. On quite a few occasions, as I passed by the building housing the Bank, I saw Hendra proceeding happily on to Collyer Quay. I had no doubt that, on each occasion, he had managed either to extend or to replenish his overdraft.\nBang Bang Hendra greeted me warmly whenever our paths crossed. On two occasions he invited me to have lunch with him, assuring me that he had just discovered a restaurant with “suitable dishes”. I reciprocated. In due course, we became acquainted with one another. As was to be expected, informality replaced the cold business protocol.\nBang Bang manifested an interest in my obsession with eighteenth-century porcelain. I, in turn, was impressed by his activities as a breeder of exotic fish. When he discussed his hobby, he shed his image of a questionable business entrepreneur and talked about his subject with a fervour verging on devotion. It was difficult to associate this aficionado with the financial charlatan who used disappearing ink in his contractual transactions.\nSoon it became clear to me that he wished to shed that unsavoury image. One morning he came over to my office and asked me to help him in his latest dealings with the Bank. His overdraft stood at that time at S$180,000. He wanted the Bank to accept payment of part of the amount in full settlement. Effectively, he was asking the Bank to waive part of his indebtedness.\n“But how can I help you in this matter? As you know, I am one of their legal advisers. I can’t take a position that conflicts with their interests.”\n“Oh, I know this, Peter. But you see, Norbert is prepared to settle. His main fear is that Freddie will make a fuss.”\n“But surely, Bang Bang, this matter is up to the Head of the Bad Loans Department. It has nothing to do with compliance.”\n“Norbert and I know this. But Freddie was involved in some … earlier dealings. Norbert wants to forestall any further unpleasantness.”\n“So how do I fit into it?”\n“Norbert says you are Freddie’s good friend. He thinks that a gentle word from you might do the trick.”\n“I think, Bang Bang, that the best way is to have a frank word with Freddie. I suggest you call on him in person. But you know, Freddie will ask why they should accept part payment.”\nHendra was aware of the need to show cause. To explain his position, he produced a memorandum prepared by his accountant. It showed that, over the years, Hendra had paid a great deal of money by way of penalty interest and bank charges. He would have been better off if a rate of 8.5 per cent had been charged on his median debit balance over the period.\n“But surely penalties and charges are not part of a bank’s profit?” I averred.\n“Not in theory. But all in all, the total amount is paid out of my own pocket and is received by the Bank! What I am saying, Peter, may be wrong in theory. But commercially it’s sound. After all, I am poorer by the total sum paid by me for obtaining banking facilities and their extensions.”\n“You may find it difficult to convince Freddie. But, Bang Bang, I take your point.”\nTo my relief Freddie, too, was impressed by the figures. They demonstrated that if the Bank accepted payment of some S$90,000 in full settlement, it would end up with a small profit. True, it would have been accrued through the imposition of penalty interest and charges. All in all, though, the Bank would not have lost money.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/matter-of-compliance/part-7/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"1-part-payment\"\u003e1.

The judges had by then discarded the archaic attire. They wore a black silk jacket and a matching discreet tie. Wigs were no longer in use.\nAs I entered the courtroom accompanied by Rachel and a young employee of Rotem, Zvi Fischer stepped over and shook my hand.\n“I’ve heard you are back, Eli. I hope you liked Oxford.”\n“I did, Zvi,” I replied slightly perplexed. On all previous occasions, Fischer and I had remained on formal terms.\n“And how do you like Singapore?”\n“It’s a nice PLACE. Actually, the government has launched public housing projects all over the town. They operate on a system akin to our joint ownership apartment buildings. Your designs would be just right.”\n“I’d love to see these developments one day,” he told me and returned to his side of the room.\nShortly thereafter, the usher announced the Judge was about to arrive. The few persons present rose to their feet and bowed to. Morag returned our greeting graciously and took his seat on the bench. As I looked at him, I felt grateful to Boaz for his warning. Ehud Morag’s presence and keen expression used to command the respect of all in attendance. Even now his demeanour confirmed that he remained the master of his court. But the lustre in his eyes was gone. So was the eternal twinkle. I was facing an aging man.\nBefore the formal hearing started, Boaz applied that the case be heard in two parts. When I agreed, Morag granted the application. Boaz then introduced his case and as called Fischer as his first witness. To my surprise, Fischer proceeded slowly and with some hesitation.\nBoaz’s examination-in-chief was brief. He took Fischer through the main events but, I noticed, did not touch on facts that had not been spelt out in Fischer’s original report on the accident.\nFischer stuck to his original story: he had arrived well after 8.00 a.m. and proceeded directly to the accident site. Boaz did not refer to the time of Fischer’s arrival or to the time of the accident. He was keen to close the examination-in-chief as quickly as possible. As soon as he resumed his seat, I stood up to cross-examine.\n“You are one of Tel-Aviv’s renowned designer of factories and joint ownership housing, Mr Fischer?”\n“I believe I am well known in my profession,” retorted Fischer with pomp.\n“Please answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’, Mr Fischer,” interceded Boaz.\n“In that case: yes, I am.”\n“You are also an experienced surveyor of work on building sites?”\n“Well, yes.”\n“How many sites did you survey in, say, the last six months?”\n“I don’t see what this has got to do with this case,” Fischer flared up.\n“Kindly answer the question” instructed Morag, looking at Fischer narrowly.\n“I can’t recall!”\n“Three?” asked Morag.\n“More than that.”\n“Twenty?”\n“Not so many!”\n“So, you can’t recall how many sites you inspected during the last six months, but you are certain the number is somewhere between 3 and 20?”\n“Quite so,” replied Fischer testily.\n“How many times did you inspect the current building site?” asked Morag unperturbed but irked.\n“Two or three, Your Honour,” replied a much deflated Fischer.\n“You inspected the progress made in the construction of the 1st floor?”\n“I did.”\n“On these occasions, was the accident-plank there?” persisted Morag, who had by then taken over my role.\n“I don’t know! I mean: I have no idea.”\n“And on the day of the accident, did you expect to find the plank?”\n“Of course not.”\n“It wasn’t supposed to be there, was it?”\n“No, it wasn’t.”\n“Did you ask what it was doing there?”\n“No, I didn’t!”\n“You just stepped on it?”\n“I did, rather.”\n“Sorry for butting in Mr. Berger. I think you better continue.”\n“Just a question or two, Your Honour. Mr. Fischer, the scaffolding was erected according to standard building regulations?”\n“It was.”\n“And you have a great deal of experience in inspecting sites under construction.”\n“I’ve already said so.”\n“No further questions, Your Honour. But, of course, my Learned Colleague may wish to recall the witness if the case proceeded to the next part.”\n“Precisely,” nodded Morag.\nBoaz advised that he was not calling any further witnesses at this stage. I, in turn, decided not to introduce evidence. Under standard civil procedure, Boaz was supposed to address the court forthwith. Keeping with the philosophy of Jacob Keren’s law firm, I waived my right to have the last word.\n“Then, you have to address me straight away,” pointed out Morag.\n“I am ready,” I assured him.\n“So am I,” grinned Boaz.\n“Very well then,” said Morag smiling at both of us benignly. We were about to address him on one of his pet subjects: the difficult legal issue he had discussed in his role as our teacher. Morag looked forward to the occasion.\nMy address was brief. A landlord did owe a duty of care to people using the building. He had to maintain the premises so as not to cause injury to a reasonable man. Such a person should not be expected to dodge traps. In particular, no ‘ambush’ should be placed in a reasonable man’s way. In the instant case, though, it was impossible to invoke the test based on the expectations of a reasonable man. Such a man had no place on a scaffolding. He ought to find less hazardous pastimes, for instance, relaxing in front of his television set.\n“But surely, you must not put a chair in his way or ask him to walk over a dangerous surface like a wet floor?” asked Morag.\n“Of course not. And you must not booby trap the terminal. These duties are owed to any person found on the premises or in the television room. And, Your Honour, I submit this is the only duty owed by a developer to a technical surveyor, who is a construction works expert.”\n“But wasn’t the plank a trap?”\n“The plaintiff conceded that the plank should not have been there. He himself is the very expert to establish the point. Instead, he stepped on the plank although he knew that was not part of the scaffolding. Why then did he step on it? There is no evidence to establish that, seen from the plaintiff’s point of view, the plank was a trap.”\nBoaz’s reply was even shorter than my address. He insisted that Fischer, had been asked by the defendants to inspect the progress and standards of the factory under construction. In consequence, they owed him the duty to make the site safe for any ‘reasonable man’. How could a reasonable man be expected to examine the safety of every plank on a scaffolding? By its very nature, such an object was a trap.\n“Even when the victim of the accident is an expert on buildings and scaffoldings?”\n“That is my submission. Further, a reasonable man cannot be expected to anticipate such a hurdle. Here the plaintiff was in the position of a ‘reasonable man’ notwithstanding his expertise.”\n“Notwithstanding his knowledge that the plank ought not to be there?”\n“That, Your Honour, is our submission.” Boaz then referred to the authorities in point.\n“Two fine addresses, if I may say so,” observed Morag. He was beaming at his two one- time students.\n“Both are derived from what my Learned Friend and I were taught by a fine teacher,” I told the Judge. Boaz nodded his consent.\n“I need some 15 minutes to collect my thoughts. I’ll deliver an ex tempore judgment as soon as we resume.”\nAll present rose to their feet and bowed. Morag nodded and withdrew to his chambers. When he resumed his seat on the Bench, he dismissed the claim. By and large, he accepted my arguments. But he added two points. First, Fischer had not established that the plank was a trap. In other words, he had failed to prove a vital point of his case. Secondly, the ‘reasonable man’ test was of no help. If a ‘reasonable man’ were to find himself on a scaffolding, he would take extra care when he sought to depart. It was common ground that the accident took place when the plank gave way. But it was unclear why the plaintiff stepped on it when he knew the plank should not have been there.\n“The parties may wish to address me on the issue of costs. Further, the case turned on a difficult issue. Please let me know in case you require Written Grounds of Judgment. The plaintiff may, of course, wish to take the matter further. I’ll call a break now. Please be back at 2.30 p.m.”\n“Can we have an indication of Your Honour’s thoughts respecting contributory negligence? The issue could arise if one applied the ‘reasonable man’ test,” asked Boaz.\n“The evidence is too scanty for a determination or even a firm indication. Off the cuff, I would anticipate a finding of about 60 per cent against the plaintiff. In my judgment, though, the ‘reasonable man’ test is inapplicable. Further, I wonder if the test has been misguided right from its inception. Has any one of you ever met a ‘reasonable man’?”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/scaffolding/part-7/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eBoaz and myself wore gowns: a remnant of the colonial period.

At 9.00 a.m. on the appointed day, Justice Ehood Morag took his seat on the Bench. His quick glance at Simha’s wheelchair confirmed that Morag had read his papers and, in all probability, had made copious notes summarising the pleadings and the facts.\nBoth Boaz and I knew him well from our days at the Law School. Morag, who held an Adjunct Lectureship, had taught the course on the Law of Torts and some elective subjects. His brilliant mind had gained him universal respect just as his sharp tongue had antagonised students unable to keep up with him. Boaz and I had had no problems in this regard: each of us had been a star performer. Boaz, though, had found Morag too mercurial, too unpredictable, as a judge. I, in contrast, admired Morag’s intellectual feats on the Bench.\n“Seems a pretty clear case,” said Morag, pushing his file away from him. “The defendants admit liability but plead contributory negligence and contest the amount claimed by way of damages for pain, sufferings and loss of pleasure of life.”\n“I appear for the plaintiff Your Honour. My Learned Friend, Mr. Berger, appears for the defendants.”\n“I take it the parties have made every effort to settle?” said Morag.\n“We have, You Honour,” confirmed Boaz. “It is a matter of regrets to both of us that, even so, the case had to be put down for trial.”\n“Could I possibly assist?” asked Morag. Usually, Morag would have proceeded straight to business. His offer was, thus, unexpected. Was he, too, driven to sympathy by the extent of the injuries including the one not pleaded? Having taken in our positive reaction to his offer, Morag concluded: “In that case, may I see counsel in chambers?”\nAccepting Morag’s invitation to sit down and drop formalities, Boaz gave a balanced description of our attempts to settle on a pension. He conceded we had made a fair offer and that it would be unrealistic to expect the defendants to improve it any further.\n“What’s the problem then?” asked Morag with a touch of impatience. “Surely, the plaintiff must be aware that in the present economic climate such an indexed pension and guaranteed employment are more than what most of us can expect?”\n“He knows this, Judge,” conceded Boaz, whilst I nodded to provide moral support.\n“So, what’s the problem?”\n“The plaintiff’s son, Shimon Balani, is keen on a lump sum; and he calls the shots!”\n“Haven’t you talked to him?”\n“Both I and the Boss, Mr. Silver! We arranged a last-ditch meeting between them and defendants’ counsel.”\n“Then, what can I do?” asked the Judge.\nBoaz let his unease show. “He may listen if the words come …”\n“… from the Bench” grinned Morag. “What do you think, Berger?”\n“Members of his community hold ‘authority’ in high regard, Judge. It is a matter of upbringing. I believe a last attempt – coming from you – might carry the day.”\n“It’s worth a try,” agreed Morag. “After all, a Judge’s function is to do justice – not just to apply the law blindly according to its letter – often an outdated letter at that! I’ll tell the orderly to bring in the Balanis and that fellow from Solbon.”\nShimon wheeled his father into the Chambers. A sturdy, good looking, youth in his mid twenties, he was awed by the solemn surroundings and appeared ill at ease. Simha, in contrast, remained his urbane self, looking at the Judge with respect but without trepidation. Malka Balani sought refuge in a remote corner of the room. Solbon’s employee, a middle aged man with grey hair and piercing eyes, who had but one arm, took a seat near me. A smile of recognition indicated he knew Boaz. When all of us had settled down, Morag proceeded straight to the point.\n“Counsel tell me there has been a discussion about an indexed pension and guaranteed light employment. Acceptance or rejection rests with the parties but – in my eyes – it is a fine offer. Why doesn’t it appeal to you, Mr. Balani?”\n“Oh, it is a fair offer, Your Honour. But my son, Shimon, thinks a lump sum is better for us. His idea is to use the money to start a business.”\n“That’s not the object of compensation, Mr. Balani,” explained Morag. “What the law wants to achieve is, first, to compensate you for your sufferings and, secondly, to ensure that you have the means for a standard of life comparable to what you had before the accident.”\n“Shimon intends to give me more than this if his business goes well!”\n“My father will sit at the head of our table and enjoy a lifestyle befitting a king” volunteered Shimon, overcoming his initial unease.\n“And if your business does not succeed?” asked the Judge.\n“I’ll devote my life to looking after Dad!” Shimon spoke with conviction, leaving an impact on all of us.\n“But would it not be simpler to accept the proposed pension? It is risk free and gives your father an iron clad security for the future, at least as far as finance is concerned?”\nShimon fidgeted. Malka Balani avoided Morag’s searching glance. It was clear she did not wish to be dragged into the discussion. To my disappointment, Simha brought the matter to an end: “You are very kind, Your Honour. We are grateful. But I do believe in my son!”\n“In the ultimate,” Morag responded without manifesting any feelings, “the decision is yours. The law entitles you to a lump sum. Once the defendants pay it, their liability to you is discharged: even if your sufferings are exacerbated at a future point of time!”\n“Can my husband perhaps think it over?” Malka Balani assumed the courage to ask.\n“Very well,” said Morag. “In the meantime, I can hear arguments about the two points in issue: contributory negligence and the measure of damages. As there is agreement on the medical evidence, I take it the plaintiff is the only witness.”\n“Most of the facts are ‘common ground’, Judge,” said Boaz.\n“we can return to Court to hear those still in issue. If the plaintiff decides to accept the pension, I’ll deliver judgment on the basis of the settlement.”\n“That will be a satisfactory way to proceed” I agreed. Boaz nodded.\nThe formal hearing was anticlimactic. As all relevant facts had been affirmed in Simha’s responses to the ‘interrogatories’ – the questions put to him before the trial – my cross- examination took less than half an hour. Boaz did not bother to re-examine. The arguments, too, were brief and to the point. Morag observed that the claim far exceeded the maximum award that could be made by him under the current Practice Direction. The final award would, accordingly, have to be determined by the Court of Appeal.\nWe spent the rest of the morning session on arguing the contributory negligence point. Morag made no secret of his dissatisfaction with the prevailing state of the law.\n“It galls me to have to treat the good Samaritan at par with a careless person, who precipitates in an accident by a foolish act, like crossing a road although he sees a car approaching at high speed. Can you compare a person who risks his own safety for the sake of another, with somebody who throws caution aside because he is in a hurry?”\n“This is why we believe that, in the instant case, the defendants ought to drop the plea of contributory negligence,” agreed Boaz.\n“What do you say, Mr. Berger?”\n“Your Honour’s analysis exposes the need for reform. At this stage, though, the law is as already stated. It is, accordingly, binding on us,” I said unhappily.\n“But the law as is discourages people from doing what many of us regard a civic duty, like risking life to save a drowning child! Is that acceptable?”\n“I’m not suggesting it is a satisfactory doctrine, Your Honour,” I said, noting a quick exchange of glances between Morag, Boaz and Solbon’s Degan. “If the issue arose in a debate of the Philosophical Society I would, perhaps, take a different view …”.\n“But here, of course, you have to look after your clients’ interests, unless they decide to waive the defence. Well, and what are your thoughts as to the extent of the contribution?”\n“My Learned Friend and I have discussed the point at length. Any figure between 10 and 20 percent appears reasonable.”\nOnce again, Morag turned to the file and to his notes. Satisfied that all points had been covered, he suggested we adjourn till 2.30p.m. He should be able to deliver judgment as soon as the plaintiff had communicated his decision about the proposed pension.\nThe Balanis withdrew discreetly. Having exchanged civilities with Boaz and myself, Degan went back to his office at Solbon to discuss the developments with his associates. Left on our own, Boaz and I proceeded in the direction of David Mizrachi’s eatery. Both of us felt the need for a good lunch. Initially, Boaz told me the news about his family. His wife, Miri, had been promoted to the post of Vice-Principal of the School, his daughter got excellent grades in Hebrew Literature, Composition and History and his son – my favourite – was showing signs of getting over his asthma. For more than three months he had not had an attack.\n“That’s excellent news, Boaz. I only hope he doesn’t overdo things.”\n“Miri keeps a watchful eye over him,” said Boaz, who doted on his wife. “She really knows how to handle him!”\n“He’s a lucky boy,” I countered, brooding over my own childhood which had been largely ruined by the same disease.\nOver coffee Boaz turned back to our case. Grudgingly, he conceded that Ehood Morag had handled the matter well. He had not expected an old stickler to the rules like Morag to possess a humane alter ego.\n“But do you think Shimon will give way?” I asked. “The decision rests with him!”\n“He was impressed by what Morag told them. But I fear it may be too late for him to double back!”\n“What makes you think that?”\n“Something he said after we left the Chambers. I suspect he has already committed the funds to a project planned with some friends!”\nBoaz’s surmise appeared well founded. When we got back to the court house, Simha advised us they had decided to press for a lump sum. He appreciated our efforts but, all in all, concluded a large amount in cash was what the family needed.\nEhood Morag did not display any feelings. He granted Simha the largest amount he was able to award but reduced it by apportioning 15 per cent to Simha’s contributory negligence. He said, specifically, that he felt bound to follow precedent but that the Court of Appeal would have the opportunity to review the law in point.\nAs we walked back, Boaz concluded: “Between ourselves, I should not be surprised if Solbon decided to drop the contributory negligence point at the appeal.”\n“What makes you think that? They always insist Rotem plead it in industrial accidents.”\n“I know. But I suspect Amnon Degan will have a say and I know his attitude.”\n“I noticed you knew him,” I nodded. “How come?”\n“He was my superior in the Army. He was in regular service before he lost his arm.”\n“Actually, how did this happen?”\n“His troupe was ambushed and one of his men was shot in the belly. Amnon Dagan deigned to send someone else in. He got the chap out but, as he scrambled to safety, a bullet shattered his arm just above the elbow. They had to amputate.”\n“Does Morag know this?” I prompted.\n“Morag chaired the ensuing inquest. He commended Dagan’s courage and selflessness.”\n“This throws light on Morag’s blunt words this morning. Still, he meant what he said. Make no mistake!”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/simha-glory/part-7/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSome eight months passed before Simha’s case was set for trial. At 9.00 a.m. on the appointed day, Justice Ehood Morag took his seat on the Bench.

I, in contrast, admired Morag’s intellectual feats on the Bench.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Part 7: Hearing Before Morag"},{"content":"Jacob Keren expressed satisfaction with the authorities I had unearthed in Jerusalem. They established that the issue involved was very much alive. Usually, we would have appraised the other party’s lawyer. However, sending my detailed opinion to Ben Zion Vered was risky. His duty would be to plug holes in it. Jacob Keren considered it safer to leak the opinion to Rotem.\n“But how?” asked Rachel. “Wouldn’t this be … unethical?”\n“If we sent it to Ruth Schwartz or Hannah Hod, Vered might raise the matter with the Law Society; and justifiably so. But remember: I am a director of Rotem. What is there to stop me from showing to the Board an opinion which I received in the course of my professional activities?”\nIt was a sound strategy. It ensured that my opinion would be dispatched to Ben Zion by his own clients, under the guise of an analysis that casts doubts on the firm’s general business orientation. He would have to weigh the argument raised by me as a general concept or doctrine and not merely as a point raised in the context of our case. Rotem would have to appreciate that my conclusions were tenable.\nTwo weeks later a meeting of the parties involved was arranged at that Rotem’s request. The comity of the Bar demanded that we convene it in our office. As we did not have a proper Board Room, Jacob’s Keren spacious office was the venue.\nRotem was represented by Ben Zion Vered, flanked by Ruth Schwartz and Hannah Hod. Rachel and I looked after Dahlia’s interests and Boaz after Franz Wolf’s and Wollor’s. Wolf, too, was present. Although the clients would usually be asked to come over only during an advanced stage of the negotiations, Boaz insisted that Wolf’s knowledge of German law would stand all parties in good stead. Jacob Keren, who attended as Dahlia’s senior counsel, occupied his usual place behind his imposing desk. This position conferred on him the extra authority usually enjoyed by a chairman. It was reinforced by the neutrality dictated by his special and long-standing relationship with Rotem.\nBen Zion started the ball rolling by describing the opinion, signed by Rachel and myself, well reasoned. He then turned to me and asked pointedly whether I believed the arguments raised by us would be accepted by a court. How would I rate the chances?\n“About fifty-fifty,” I admitted\n“Perhaps somewhat better than that,” interceded Boaz. “The courts are aware that section 64 is still alive. I’d say the chances are about 60% or even 70% in favour of the view expressed in the opinion.”\n“I was inclined to rank them as 40%,” disagreed Ben Zion. “Still, in view of the plaintiff’s compelling case, I’d accept Eli’s fifty-fifty assessment. What do you think, Mr. Keren?”\n“Difficult to say,” Keren spoke judiciously. “A few years ago, I should have thought such an argument was bound to fail. Our judiciary is conservative and inclined to regard English law as sacrosanct. But the winds seem to be changing and, of course, Dahlia will have the sympathy of the court. Therefore, I think the chances are slightly better.” Pausing for a moment, he added: “Seen from Rotem’s point of view – or of the business world in general – it might be sensible to deal with this point in a less disturbing case.”\n“I agree with this sentiment,” observed Ruth Schwartz.\n“Actually, so do I,” nodded Ben Zion. “This is an unusual case and, of course, Wollor is a client of long standing. We accept that this in not an ordinary case of a lapsed policy.”\n“So, what do you propose?” stepped in Rachel. As often before, she started the practical negotiations at what appeared a favourable juncture.\n“Without prejudice, we are prepared, in principle, to treat the policy as if it had not lapsed,” said Ben Zion. “But, of course, we must discuss the amount involved and consider some apportionment.” Ben Zion’s last words suggested that he would expect Wollor to meet part of the claim. The percentage would depend on the excess clause in the original policy and possibly on the extent of Wollor’s fault.\n“I am not clear about the second point,” Boaz interceded. “Surely, the policy covers Wollor’s third-party liability. So why does it matter whether or not the accident can be attributed, in whole or in part, to its own negligence. It is irrelevant.”\n“It’s not that simple,” countered Ben Zion. “According to clause 12 of the policy, Wollor is not entitled to be re-paid more than 50% of a loss caused by its gross negligence.”\n“Why is that of any relevance here?” I thought it important to ask.\n“Because,” explained Hannah, “the ‘Safety in Operations’ section of the manual supplied to Wollor emphasised the guillotine must be switched off at the mains when it is serviced or cleaned. We appreciate that this does not have a bearing on Dahlia’s claim against Wollor; but it affects our liability to Wollor. It would be relevant even if the policy had never lapsed.”\n“That puts it in a nutshell,” echoed Ben Zion. “Mr. Keren, don’t you agree?”\n“I am not sure I ought to express an opinion,” prevaricated Keren. “I am in a somewhat delicate position.”\n“But this is a without prejudice meeting,” insisted Ben Zion. “Everything we say is confidential. As an experienced personal accidents lawyer, you must have formed an opinion.”\nKeren caved in. “Doctrinally you are right. But is this the way you expect Rotem to act in a case like this? If Dahlia gets an inadequate amount, the surgical steps may be in jeopardy!”\nBen Zion fidgeted. It was clear that Jacob Keren’s measured pronouncement carried weight with him. As an observant Jew, he felt respect for his elders.\n“I agree with Mr. Keren’s view,” stepped in Hannah. “This is not an ordinary case. We are entitled to rely on an excess clause and on clause 12. But do we want to do so in this case?”\n“Well, so what do you say, Hannah?” stepped in Rachel.\n“It’s a difficult one,” explained Hanna with some awkwardness. “The terms of an agreement have to be observed: this is trite law. But – for the last two weeks – I have been tormented by one though: what would I feel if the victim had been my Tali and an insurance company had taken this stand. Need I say any more?”\nHer words left an impression on all of us. Here was a tragic accident, which in all probability ruined the life of an innocent victim. True, the mains should have been switched off. But how could Dahlia – a temporary relief worker – proceed to do so when even the boss himself, Franz Wolf, had handled the guillotine without taking this precaution.\nRuth Schwartz and Jacob Keren nodded. Winking at me, Boaz added: “This sort of technicality – this clause – subjects the Law to the contempt of ordinary people. Surely, you agree, Ben Zion.”\n“As a man, I agree,” he said unhappily. “As a responsible attorney, in charge of Rotem’s interests, I am bound to raise this issue. It is my duty as lawyer!”\nBoaz agreed. “In your position I should feel under a duty to take the same stand. But don’t you think that Rotem has to protect the humanitarian reputation it enjoys in Israel?”\n“That is not for me to decide,” Ben Zion let his unhappiness show. “That is a policy matter, to be decided by Rotem’s management.”\n“I shall raise it with them.” Ruth Schwartz was speaking as senior in-house counsel. “I agree with Hannah’s summary. I am sure we all do, both here and in other forums.” She had addressed the last few words to Jacob Keren, her former pupil master.\n“I suggest we meet again in, say, 10 days or so,” said Keren. “And let all clients be there. Any further point?”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ravages-of-a-guillotine/part-7/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eJacob Keren expressed satisfaction with the authorities I had unearthed in Jerusalem.

Each clever move cancelled out another, which meant that we produced more heat than light. The proceedings, though, did not disrupt our friendship. During the very same period, I came over regularly to the Tamirs’ residence, usually bringing with me a bottle of wine or, as was the custom in Israel, fresh fruit for their table. Invariably, we had a pleasant time, playing after dinner a game of Monopoly, listening to music, or discussing fervently some political events or newly published books. The only subject we stayed clear off was the Omri Tal trial.\nI recall one evening, when Miri prepared a sumptuous meal. Noting my apprehensive look, she smiled at me warmly: “No, Eli, I’m not being extravagant. We have just received a letter from America. My Aunt Lilly passed away a few weeks ago. She left us some 35,000 dollars!”\n“That’s wonderful,” I said.\n“Let’s hope Auntie Lilly’s spirit agrees with you,” observed Boaz dryly. “Still, we are now able to repay our mortgage in full!”\n“But don’t you want to take a trip to Europe or America first?” I asked.\n“Sooner or later we shall. We’ll start saving for it straight away. But first I want to tell our bank manager to go jump!”\nA few days later the Tamirs went for a fortnight to Kibbutz Yokneam. I, in turn, proceeded to Mount Karmel, then a sparsely populated and unspoiled haven. Leaving the office and my work behind me, I went for long walks in the brisk mountain air which, even during the Mediterranean summer, retained its cool and dry touch. I returned to Tel Aviv revitalised, ready for the start of the new Judicial Session.\nAs I prepared myself for the hearing before Ehood Morag, I sensed that all procedural antics had been exhausted. Unfortunately, a discreet report of Joseph Almog, a well known private investigator, affirmed that, up to then, young Omri Tal had not put in an appearance in his beloved dancing club. I was raking my brain for a good excuse for a further adjournment, when I got an unexpected telephone call from Miri Tamir.\n“Eli,” she said in her direct manner. “Boaz asked me to ring you about the appearance before Judge Morag next Monday.”\n“Is anything wrong?”\n“Not really. We are all fine, but Boaz was called up for reservist service! He had to leave yesterday!”\n“Didn’t they give him some notice?”\n“They said they sent him a summons, but we never got it. They probably sent it to the wrong address. When he didn’t respond, they came over to take him!”\n“Just like that?” I let my annoyance show.\n“Just like that; and they were rude. Still, he’s an officer: so, in the end, they had to behave themselves. But Boaz had to go; and he won’t be back for six weeks!”\n“What is to be done?”\n“Nobody in the office wants to take the case over. Boaz wants you to explain the position to the Judge.”\n“It’s unusual, Miri. Still, Morag knows both of us well. So I’m pretty sure he’ll understand.”\n“That’s what Boaz said,” she replied.\n“I’ll ring you as soon as I have appeared before Morag. In the meantime, please give my best wishes to Boaz.”\nEhood Morag’s associate led me to the Judge’s Chambers as soon as I arrived but, to my surprise, did not stay put. As I was being heard in the absence of the ‘other party’ this was unusual. Noting my surprise, Morag explained the position readily.\n“In view of what I have got to say, we can skip all formalities, Berger. But, first, how was your break?”\n“Good, Judge. I had a pleasant time up Mount Karmel. I love it there.”\n“Hopefully, your haven will not be discovered too soon by tourists,” he said with a smile. Looking at him more closely, I concluded that he, too, had had a relaxing holiday. All the same, he did not appear particularly ebullient. Indeed, I had the impression he was ill at ease.\n“Boaz Tamir asked me to apologise to you for this irregularity, Judge. Regrettably, the army did not give him any warning. He was called up suddenly; and he’ll be away for six weeks.”\n“I understand. The army says the safety of the homeland constitutes a first priority. In their eyes, our timetables are irrelevant. Unfortunately, Tamir’s ‘abduction’ means that I shan’t be able to hear the case.”\n“Why, Sir” I said, correcting myself instantly, “I mean, Judge.”\n“The Frumm Factory explosion case is coming up in five weeks and I have been asked to take it on. I expect it to last at least four months. Your case should not be in abeyance for such a span. It would have to be heard by another judge, probably Baruch Shoham. I hope Tamir and you will appear before me in another matter in the future. I like to watch my former students in action.”\nBoaz Tamir, to whom I conveyed the information through Miri, expressed his unequivocal approval. “Boaz,” Miri informed me, “says he prefers Shoham’s common sense to Morag’s brilliant but often fancy analysis.”\nHannah, too, voiced her relief. “I always know where I stand with Shoham. Morag is mercurial! I know he is very clever. But I’d rather have a down to earth judge than an intellectual giant!”\nA few days later Hannah told me the major case, handled by Keren and herself, had been settled. “A sudden breakthrough?” I asked.\n“Not really. They could have settled on the same terms from the word go. But all involved had to exhaust themselves before they were prepared to come to the conference table in a mood to compromise!”\n“And the lawyers made a handsome profit. Still, the settlement lets you off the hook earlier than expected.”\n“It does. And Keren has already found a suitable replacement.”\n“Who?”\n“Rachel Zeitlin. She has ditched her second husband and feels Jerusalem is too small a place for the two of them!”\n“So, we’ll have the honour of seeing her in Tel Aviv,” I grunted.\n“And you better watch out,” Hannah confided, maternally. “Rachel is sure to look for her number three!”\n“You better introduce her to Abraham Kadmon. The poor chap had a bad shock when his wife ran away with that taxi driver. A liaison with a hot shot lawyer like Rachel will boost his shaken ego.”\n“I’ll do my best,” Hannah giggled. “But I have it on good authority that Rachel is looking for a nice, young and innocent bloke!”\n“That leaves me out!” I asserted.\n“Glad to have allayed your fears. We better turn our undivided attention to Omri Tal! I remain on the case. And, Eli, have a look at Almog’s latest report: Valentino is back on the dancing floor but restricts himself to Waltz and Tango.”\n“Does this help our cause?” I asked, skimming through the document. “The chap was a virtuoso. Some social dancing is neither here nor there!”\n“True! But where there’s life there’s hope. Before long, Omri will start afresh!”\n“But surely,” I persevered, “there is a difference between social dancing and Omri Tal’s original aspirations to fame?”\n“There is. But the orthopaedic surgeons did not rule out rehabilitation. So, perhaps, we can demand a further medical examination?”\n“I’ll raise the matter in the pre-trial session. If the case is really assigned to Shoham, we’ll get an order.”\n“Very likely. In the meantime, we better keep Omri Tal ‘under observation’. But, Eli, we need time!”\n“I\u0026rsquo;ll see what I can do. But I’m running out of gimmicks!”\n“Play it by ear, then” she suggested.\nIn the event, Fortuna smiled on us. Some ten days before Boaz’s discharge from reservist service, Miri called again. “Eli, Boaz asked me to tell you he needs a further extension.”\n“Don’t tell me they’re keeping him for some extra time?”\n“No, that’s not the reason,” her voice shook as spoke.\n“What is wrong? I hope nothing happened to him.”\n“He is sick, Eli. He’s got hepatitis! He is in hospital.”\n“Jaundice?” I asked anxiously. “I’ve never known Boaz to be sick, Miri, except of course a cold or soar throat here and there. What happened?”\n“Two of his men took him for a meal in Ramleh. You know he loves Arab food. I suspect the plates had not been properly rinsed.”\n“Can I visit him?”\n“He’ll be hospitalised for two weeks. You can come over when I bring him home. But you better be careful: it’s very contagious. I’m sending the kids to Yokneam. Mom will look after them until Boaz recovers.”\n“Let me know how he is doing and when he is likely to be back at work? The judge may ask.”\n“It’ll take him six weeks to recover and he’ll have to rest at home for another two or three weeks.”\n“I’ll ask for a two months adjournment.”\nJudge Shoham’s associate secured the required adjournment straight away. During the next two months, Hannah kept getting detailed reports from Joseph Almog, our P.I. He confirmed that Omri and his ‘charming Dahlia’ were attending two, occasionally three, social dancing sessions in their club each week. In later reports, Almog, who had gained Omri’s confidence, confirmed that Omri was again keeping normal working hours in his workshop. Later still, Omri had confided he was ‘fed up with the stuck up society of Tel Aviv’ and planned to move to Be’er Sheva in the Negev. In due course, Omri and Dahlia put down a deposit on a three-bedroom house in a fashionable suburb of their chosen town. They planned to get married as soon as they moved down South. Almog had been invited to attend their engagement party.\n“So you see, Eli,” Hannah smirked with satisfaction. “Young Valentino’s positive outlook on life is standing him in good stead. I bet that as soon as Mr. \u0026amp; Mrs. Tal settle in Be’er Sheva, they’ll start a dancing club!”\nBoaz took longer than anticipated to recover. Like most vigorous and self assured men, he was a difficult patient, given to petulant outbursts followed by spells of remorse, melancholy and depression. Their effect on Miri was devastating. Occasionally, I felt more concerned for her than for the invalid she was painstakingly nursing back to health.\nIn an attempt to alleviate their burden, I came over to their place as often as work permitted. Because alcohol and fruit had been proscribed by the doctor, I brought Boaz books, magazines and, from time to time, reports of new legal decisions. Boaz was a voracious reader and, over the seven weeks he remained bedridden, got immersed in some philosophic tracts as well as in modern novels.\nReading, though, did not keep Boaz fully occupied. Every now and then he rang up his secretary to get the latest office news and, whenever I turned up, cross-examined me on what was going on in our small and closely knit legal fraternity. After a while it dawned on me that I was not his only source of information. One evening, for instance, he asked whether Hannah had already taken up her new post at Rotem.\n“She has. We gave her a splendid farewell party. Keren used the occasion to deliver a moving speech!”\n“Praising Hannah’s performance?”\n“That too. But his main theme was the virtue of steady work and perseverance.”\n“Was Keren by any chance trying to impress Rachel Zeitlin? I’m told she has taken over from Hannah!”\n“You do keep your ear to the ground.”\n“I am allowed to tap the grapevine – even although drinking is prohibited for the time being. And, Eli, I hope you’ll come to like Rachel. She’s exciting and – let me tell you – a nice girl!”\n“Nice? How about her two divorces?”\n“I’m not suggesting she’s suitable for a lasting relationship. She is self-centred and can be quite a handful. But an evening with her is fun!”\n“I’ll convey the information to Abraham Kadmon. We are making a concentrated effort to bring the two lost souls together!”\n“Don’t be silly. Kadmon is too old for her. And he is a non-entity. Rachel will have a fit if he dares to ask her out.”\n“So why do you wish her Ladyship on poor me?”\n“Because you, Eli, must not go on pining for the girl who said ‘no’ to you ages ago!”\n“I’ll look around when pressure eases at work!”\n“Balderdash. You use every spare moment to dash over to the Philosophic Society.

He was delighted when one of London University’s Colleges conferred on him an Honorary Doctorate. Another source of joy was Lucy’s appointment as an Adjunct Professor in another College. Initially, Peppi was concerned about her drained appearance when she returned home after her classes. To his relief she soon adjusted to her position, carrying on her new duties without neglecting their shop.\nBeing a realist, Peppi acknowledged that he had no cause for complaint. He continued to lead the active life of a businessman and, in addition, enjoyed excellent health. Undoubtedly, the need for a hearing aid was a nuisance. So was the cataract in his right eye. Still, none of these trifles was going to get him down: he was still going strong!\nAll the same, Peppi sensed a growing void appearing on the horizon. Frequently he felt morose, depressed and unwilling to step out of his daily routine. Lucy, who viewed him with mounting concern, was therefore not surprised when Peppi failed to display any emotion when Anna announced the birth of her daughter.\n“I’m glad they’re going to call her ‘Helga’. But I’m not up to such a long flight, Lucy. Please give my apologies to Anna and tell her I’m gratified. I’ll give you a cheque and please get a nice gift for the baby.”\n“Of course, Papa. But is it alright for me to go? Are you sure you can manage?”\n“Yes, I can. Don’t worry about me. But don’t you tell Anna to come over to see me. It would be too much of a strain.”\n“Alright, Papa,” said Lucy and rushed out of the room.\nShe left early the next morning. In the evening, after an uneventful day in the shop followed by a quick meal in a nearby restaurant, Peppi had a heart-to-heart with his ephemeral friend.\n“Isn’t it time for me to join you, Theophil?” he asked, the moment he sensed the other’s presence.\n“Now, now, Peppi. Aren’t you being melodramatic? You imply that you find life dull. Well, do you aspire to chase young girls in the Prater or in Soho at your age? Think of my erstwhile friend Faust – what good was Gretchen to him?”\n“You know very well that that’s not what I’m after! That Schlemiel, Faust, can have them all! No, Theophil – it’s just that there is no meaning to my life any longer.”\n“You feel hollow?”\n“I do! But, perhaps, this is not a feeling you have experienced.”\n“Oh, I know what you are talking about. I, too, know the meaning of boredom and isolation. What else would spur me to take an interest in you humans?”\n“I’m not sure I understand,” admitted Peppi.\n“Do you realise how old I am?”\n“As old as the universe itself?”\n“Quite,” affirmed the gentle voice in his mind. “And so is He.”\n“What then makes us humans of any interest to you?”\n“Both of us faced a problem. He solved it by demanding that you worship and obey him. My course is to observe humanity and set it free! Well, Peppi, can you guess the nature of the problem that spurred us to our respective resolves?”\n“Could it be that in this way you found a \u0026hellip; purpose – an aim?”\n“Well spoken, my friend.” The soft voice chuckled. “Without an interest in humans, life would be dull for both Him and me. He, I suspect, would once again become a spirit hovering over an amorphous abyss. And I, Peppi, would cease to think, would cease to doubt and hence would cease to exist.”\n“I think I understand. But why are you telling me all this, Theophil?”\n“I hope to convey a message.”\n“I can’t read it!”\n“Try, Peppi.”\n“You have told me many times yours is the force of pure reason!”\n“It is, hopefully. And I have just defined the predicament I would face if there was no longer something to reason about or to arouse my curiosity.”\n“So your existence would lose its meaning! Oh, I see! You are telling me I, too, have to find something that interests me: a sort of a new purpose in life.”\n“Precisely!”\n“But I’m close to eighty. Most of my contemporaries have passed on: even Tommy Berger!”\n“All the more reason to enjoy your existence!”\n“But what sort of ‘new thing’ can I launch at this time of life?”\n“Something utterly new may very well be beyond your reach. But can’t you think of something related to your current interests – something that would give you a fresh focus without requiring a change in your way of life?”\n“I often wanted to get into the old master paintings market; but most of the so-called ‘new’ discoveries are the work of second- or third-class artists. They are eulogised by the sales houses because the real treasures of the past are in museums or in select private collections and hence not for sale.”\n“How about some other areas of artistic enterprise?”\n“I can’t think of anything directly related to tapestries and old master prints!”\n“Look a bit further afield, Peppi. How do you feel about plastic art?”\n“I have no taste for sculpture. Hold on – are you, by any chance, referring to ceramics?”\n“What do you have against them?”\n“I’ve not had the time to get into the field. So I am not able to judge. Generally, though, I prefer pure art to functional art.”\n“In your opinion, porcelain is a branch of applied arts. Well, let’s try to overcome your prejudice. Do you have any porcelain in your stock at present?”\n“Lucy told me she bought a few figurines from a ‘rum sort of a chap’. Shall I go down and get them?”\n“Let me save you the trouble,” said his friend and, even as he spoke, six mid-European figurines materialised before Peppi’s startled eyes. For a few moments they swayed pertly in front of him and then settled gracefully on his desk.\n“Well, what do you think of them?” asked Theophil.\n“They’re alright,” conceded Peppi.\n“Just alright? Why not study them closely.” Noting Peppi’s baffled expression, he went on in the same coaxing tone: “Ah, you are still in the dark. Let’s try a different tack. Fix your gaze on any one of them and then try to magnify it.”\n“Magnify it?” asked Peppi, just as bewildered as before.\n“You are slow today, Freiherr von Stölzenfeld! Try to imagine any one of these figurines in the size of a grown-up person. Why don’t you try Lola, the ballet dancer.” There was a pause. “So the penny has dropped,” observed his visitor as Peppi’s eyes cleared. “Well, what do you think of her now?”\n“She is magnificent. A fine, realistic, sculpture in porcelain! So are the other figurines.”\n“Try to hazard a guess about their age!?”\n“Judging by their attire: early to mid-18th century?”\n“Quite so, Peppi. Well, what do you have to say about them now?”\n“They are realistic – oh yes, I get it: realism in the midst of the Baroque and Rococo!”\n“Do you still maintain that they constitute inferior, purely functional, art?”\n“No, Theophil. I was wrong there. They are sculptures – real ones. And exceptional, at that. Further, they have an extra dimension: they are polychrome, whilst sculptures hewn in stone or cast in bronze are monochrome! These porcelain sculptures attain the Greek ideal of sculpture in colours!”\n“They do; and this extra dimension drove 18th century sculptors from the studio to the porcelain kilns. They strove to create three dimensional representations of life, expressed in the full range of colours available for brush work!”\n“Amazing \u0026hellip; a revelation! Do you have anything else to show me?”\n“Lucy has not unwrapped the second parcel. Shall we do it for her?”\n“Please do!”\n“Let me first fit this glove over your right arm and hand. Now straighten your arm out as far as you can and don’t bend it or move your hand any closer to your face; and keep still!”\nThe noise of beating wings was swiftly followed by the appearance of a peregrine falcon, flying majestically through the open window. It glided proudly around them, then, in response to a sound that appeared to emerge from Peppi’s lips, came to rest on the glove.\n“Here,” said Theophil gently, as a hood slid over the bird’s eyes. As if by magic, the glove disappeared and the small translucent figurine, into which the falcon had metamorphosed, settled beside the other pieces. “Kändler: the greatest animal sculptor of all times,” explained Theophil.\n“A brilliant artist,” said Peppi, deeply moved.\n“And you have neglected his creations!”\n“Isn’t it getting too late to make amends?”\n“You are unlikely to excel, Peppi. There are too many specialised dealers and knowledgeable collectors in the field. But you should be able to launch a respectable porcelain section in your shop – the shop which bears my name.”\n“Consider it done,” said Peppi thoughtfully. “But you know, once before, when I was despondent, you helped me out by \u0026hellip;”\n“\u0026hellip; by distracting you; by diverting your attention to something new, something exciting.”\n“As I used to do when little Anna came running to me with one of her woes.”\n“Precisely. Don’t tell me you are offended because I’ve used the same tactics.”\n“But then, are all our human affairs as insignificant, as fleeting, as a child’s momentary anguish?”\n“Not necessarily,” retorted the eternal observer. “And a child’s momentary anguish, as you choose to call it, can have far reaching effects in its adult life. The therapy I have used in your case – and which you applied when Anna came to you crying bitterly – is based on a time-honoured formula. We cure the patient by giving him something to alleviate his suffering. Just now you were succumbing to boredom. I provided something new – something to arouse your interest.”\n“And last time?”\n“I provided a painting which diverted you from the wound inflicted by Anna.”\n“I see. A priest, of course, would have proffered solace through faith.”\n“Quite,” agreed Theophil, gratified. “And don’t forget Karl Marx’s saying: ‘religion is the opium of the people’. Opium is a great pain killer!”\n“Strange,” reflected Peppi. “Since time immemorial you, Theophil, have been blamed for innumerable crimes committed by humanity. But my experience tells me you are kind. Further, many of the crimes were committed in His and not in your name!”\n“The old dualism,” sniggered Theophil. “God’s name is employed as the incentive for a misdeed. For instance, one nation wants to destroy another. Its leader proclaims a war in the name of the Good Lord. The victim nation – so the manifesto goes – is sinful, corrupt, evil. It ought to be wiped out. After the perpetration of the crime, when a more humane generation feels ashamed of it, another seer blames the devil for having incited the mob or its leader. The Good Lord, Peppi, is the legitimation. The evil devil provides the excuse voiced much later. Quite a neat allocation of roles.”\n“But – as you made Tommy Berger see – both good and evil are inherent in the creation,” mused Peppi.\n“They are. And I, let me remind you, am not the Creator! Neither Eve’s curiosity nor the murder planted in Man’s heart is my doing! Am I then to be blamed for their effects?”\n“Not on any rational grounds!” proclaimed Peppi.\nWhen Lucy returned to London, she was pleasantly surprised by Peppi’s change in outlook. He had unpacked all the porcelain pieces she had acquired from the strange peddler and had gone on a shopping spree of his own.\n“But how are we going to display all these pieces?” she asked, bewildered. “Our existing show rooms are full to the brim!”\n“That’s no problem,” replied a cheerful and invigorated Peppi. “Mike Smith wants to close down his clock shop and retire. We can acquire the premises!”\n“It’s as if somebody planned it for you!”\n“It does look that way, doesn’t it?” agreed Peppi, trying hard to sound innocent.\nPeppi’s discovery of porcelain was one of the major events in his long and fruitful life: it paved the way for his Indian Summer. In addition, the ripples on the surface of the pond – occasioned by the pebble Peppi dropped when he embarked on this new trade – affected the life of yet another person: my own self.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-devil-in-munich/chapter-7/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eTheophil’s Antiques continued to go from strength to strength as did Peppi’s fame.

Leah Early next morning, as the Matterhorn emerged in its splendour at the first rays of light, I resumed my vigil. Soon the electric cars started to arrive from the station but the patrons alighting from them bore no resemble to my Pilkin of old. By 9.00 a.m. I threw in the towel. For all I knew, Pilkin might be snoring in a comfortable room in some other hotel in Zermatt. Despite his formidable size, he constituted a needle not easily pinpointed in the haystack of the buoyant flow of tourists in the popular resort.\nAfter a lavish breakfast buffet, I proceeded along the short bridge and the small church abutting on it to a mountain train climbing to an area distinct from Furi’s. As often before, I found the ride to a resort known as the Riffelalp exhilarating. For a while, I wandered along the tracks I had come to know so well. Eventually, as I caught my breath on a bench that had been there for years, my eyes strayed back to a trip Pilkin and I had enjoyed so may years earlier.\nOn the advice of a local physician – a solemn Swiss gentleman in his late forties – we had refrained from taking any of the rides to the imposing glaciers surrounding us. Furi and the Riffelalp alone were within our reach. After three days of comfortable strolls, Pilkin’s face had regained its colour and his voice its vigour and resonance.\nOur only adventure took place as we were sitting side by side on the very bench I had kept coming back to in later years. We were deeply engrossed in a debate of a banal question. In Switzerland four distinct races had coexisted in relative harmony during a period in which the rest of Europe practised communal slaughter and savagery. Obviously, the Swiss were a civilised people. Why then had they contributed so very little to literature, music and the arts?\n“Is it possible that culture needs the stimulus of discord?” asked Pilkin.\nBefore I had the chance to reply, a mellow voice broke in: “Two Israelis opining on civilisation?” She used the plain Hebrew of our era, but a touch of sarcasm was readily discernable.\nTurning around in unison, we faced an attractive girl a few years older than us. Her smart clothes, confident manner and relaxed posture left their impact. Pleased with our reaction, she rewarded us with a warm smile.\n“I’m Leàh Cohen! I’m from Herzliya.” Her voice had now lost its amused overtone.\n“I’m Chayim Rosenne,” replied Pilkin, making his recovery, “but my friends call me Pilkin. And this is Eli Berger – or, rather, Bushi. We come from Tel Aviv!”\n“Nice to meet both of you,” she observed complacently. “And what brings you here?”\n“Just a break,” I found my voice at long last. “And you?”\n“Same thing!”\n“Care to join us?” asked Pilkin.\n“Sure,” she said.\nFor the rest of the morning the three of us kept treading along the pleasant Alpine paths. Leàh was at home in the idyllic surroundings. Obviously, she had visited them before. We had lunch together in a small café and then wound our way back to the mountain-train station.\n“Shall we take a ride further up the slope?” Leàh asked eagerly. “You get a magnificent view up there?”\n“Perhaps better not,” counselled Pilkin, his eyes avoiding mine. “Eli has Asthma and the thin air may not be too good for him!”\n“Also it’s no good for Pilkin,” I retorted, stung to the quick. “He had a heart attack some time ago and the doctor told him to avoid extreme heights!”\nFor just a moment, plain delight animated Leàh’s attractive face and her eyes danced with merriment. Then, as she took in the furious stares Pilkin and I directed at one another, her expression sobered.\n“Well, to be perfectly honest, boys, I, too, am not much of a mountaineer. I get dizzy. But occasionally I ignore it and let myself go. Still, if all three of us may be uncomfortable higher up, we better stick to the lower terrain. Have you two been to Furi?”\n“We have,” replied Pilkin, back to his normal state of composure.\n“Shall we then go there? It’s about the same height as the Riffelalp and just as lovely. Well, how about it?”\n“We’d love to come with you,” I assured her while Pilkin expressed his agreement with a benign, grateful, smile.\nLeàh’s intervention calmed the waters. Despite my initial irritation, I had to admire her presence of mind and her smooth handling of an explosive situation. Obviously, there was more to her than good looks.\nWe spent the afternoon walking together along a mountain track. Leàh, who was familiar with the area, amused us with tales about skirmishes that had taken place in this lovely corner of the Alps during the 17th and 18th centuries. Both of us agreed enthusiastically to spend the following day together with her.\nHaving seen Leàh back to her hotel, Pilkin and I walked in a sombre mood to our considerably less elegant lodgings. Although Leàh’s smart handling had averted a storm, the exchange of words and of angry stares weighed heavily on both of us. In the event, I took the initiative.\n“Pilkin, I don’t know what came over me!” I told him contritely.\n“Same here,” muttered Pilkin. “For once, both of us behaved like …”\n“… savages?”\n“No, Bushi, not savages. Like brainless louses, rather!”\n“But what made us do it, Pilkin? We never try to score off one another? Why this time?”\n“Because Leàh’s sexy and we are young unattached males. And because both of us fancied her!”\n“Pfui to both us, then! For all we know, she was just bored and wanted some company. So what made us act like stupid assholes?”\n“Stop being melodramatic, Bushi. Leàh’s an eligible girl – from our own milieu – and both of us responded to normal impulses. So let’s not turn a mole into an anthill!”\n“And she bloody well enjoyed it!”\n“Only for a second, Bushi; any woman would! But she smoothed things out very nicely! All in all, she behaved beautifully. And you have to admit: she is a cool one!”\n“True. But how about the way we acted, Pilkin?”\n“Let’s just forget about it. Let’s enjoy our outing with her tomorrow. And, Bushi, I think she’s … committed. Something tells me she’s waiting for her steady.”\n“So why didn’t they fly down together? You think he’s married?”\n“Maybe; or maybe he’s a Swiss Jew from Zürich or Basle coming up for the weekend?”\n“Oh, very well: we’ll find out tomorrow!”\nWe had a pleasant morning with Leàh, strolling happily along the pleasant paths. When we got tired, Leàh unpacked a picnic basket and watched gleefully the healthy appetites displayed – shamelessly – by Pilkin and myself. Because Pilkin skipped the fine raw ham and pork sausages, I had the lion’s share of the generous meal.\nLeàh’s relaxed airs encouraged Pilkin and me to talk about our backgrounds and to reveal our aspirations for the future. She, in turn, told us what had brought her to Zermatt. About two years earlier, when she was employed as a travel guide in Tel Aviv, Leàh had met Rolf – the scion of a prosperous Swiss Jewish family. He fell for her, took her out for a lavish dinner in the fashionable Dan Hotel by the beach of Tel Aviv and, before long, returned to Israel to pursue his interest.\nA year later she flew down to Zürich to meet his parents. She had reservations about their closely knit, rather bigoted community. But she became increasingly fond of Rolf and sensed they could enjoy a good and stable marriage. The difficulty was the need of giving up her home. Despite the wealth and comforts Rolf was able to provide, Leàh was loath to make the move. Rolf, who was a patient man, bided his time, hoping to win her over. His mother, though, was getting restive: she was yearning for a grandson.\nPlacing the utensils back into the picnic basket as we were getting ready to make our way back to the train station, Leàh confided she had to make her decision next day.\n“You see,” she explained, “Rolf is coming up from Zürich tomorrow. We’re spending the weekend together. And I’ve promised to tell him ‘yea’ or ‘nay’ by Monday.”\n“But why don’t you suggest you settle together in Israel?” I asked in the direct manner common amongst young Israelis in those remote, golden, days.\n“Rolf is with a well known Swiss bank,” she explained. “His place is in Zürich; or perhaps later on in New York. He’s got no future in Israel! And I can’t see myself leaving my home … even if the move is to an affluent town like Zürich. I’m an Israeli born and bred.”\n“I understand,” I assured her. “But why can’t you marry him, settle in Zürich and fly back to Israel once or twice a year? This way you won’t uproot yourself!”\n“That’s what my father says,” she replied. “But I don’t want to become a tourist at home. I want to spend my life in Israel. You understand, don’t you?”\n“I do,” said Pilkin.\n“And you, Bushi?”\n“It’s your decision, Leàh,” I said after a pause. “You must do what’s right for yourself!”\n“Wouldn’t you stay in Tel Aviv even if you could build up a better life abroad?” she wanted to know.\n“I’m not sure,” I confessed.\n“And you, Pilkin?”\n“It’s difficult to look into the crystal ball. But the way I feel now: Israel is my home.”\n“But you want to be an actor, Pilkin,” she persevered. “Suppose you’re offered a good opening on a foreign stage?”\n“I might go; but with the hope of coming back! Still, as Bushi says, this type of decision is strictly personal. You’ve got to make your own choice. And, Leàh, money is important; but it’s not everything.”\n“You are, of course, right: I mean both of you. And I’ve already made up my mind. But it won’t be easy to tell Rolf. He’s a dear and he’s in love with me.”\nFor the rest of the day, Pilkin and I made genuine efforts to cheer Leàh up. In due course, her face brightened. When she excused herself for a while, Pilkin suggested we take her out for a farewell dinner at the elegant restaurant of the Zermattschein. After weeks of frugal living, we could afford the gesture. It would also be a celebration marking the end of our trip.\nInitially Leàh would not hear of it. In the end, though, she agreed. When the splendid meal in Zermatt’s best restaurant was over, she insisted on going Dutch. As she was better off than ourselves, Pilkin – exercising his role as treasurer – accepted. Smiling with satisfaction, she further insisted on treating us to a liqueur. It was my first taste of Pfümlei.\nA gust of fresh wind, blowing down from the peaks, conveyed to me that, once again, I had become immersed in the past. I was now an aging man. Neither Leàh nor Pilkin were with me on the Riffelalp.\nSmiling sadly, I realised that the splendid excursion with Leàh had taken place some forty years earlier. Indeed, like Pilkin and myself, Leàh Cohen – if, indeed, she was still known by this name – had turned into a member of the older generation. Who was the lucky guy who had stepped with her under the canopy? What had become of her? How many children and grandchildren could she boast of after all these years?\nTightening my leather jacket around me, I took the track leading to the small local restaurant. I had patronised it many times in the course of the last forty years and, on each occasion, had reflected on our encounter with Leàh. After years in Anglo-Saxon societies, her lack of reserve when she had talked to casual acquaintances like us, appeared alien. At the time, though, it had seemed natural. Whilst, in many regards, Israeli society constituted a closed shop, communications between those counted “in” – or, in other words, members of the community – were open and frank to the extreme. That explained also the last conversation of Pilkin and myself on the final day of our trip.\n2. We Plan a Reunion It had been a warm and pleasant day but, toward dusk, it started to drizzle. After a simple meal in an Italian eatery, we made ourselves comfortable in the small sitting room of our hostel. For a while, both of were immersed in the daily newspapers. Eventually, Pilkin, who had read the Herald Tribune, pushed the paper away and said it would be refreshing to regain access to the Israeli press. Countering my sullen retort about the parochial orientation of our newspapers, he observed that the Herald Tribune had New York written all over its pages and that The Times was as broad minded as Gunga Din! He let his irritation show when I opined that, even so, the international press “was still twice the ‘man’ than” ours.\nTo avoid an altercation, Pilkin turned back to the Herald Tribune. When he raised his eyes from it, he looked at me reflectively. For a moment, I thought he intended to revert to our argument. His expression, though, indicated that his thoughts had strayed in a different direction.\n“We’ll have to disagree about the Press, Bushi. But I want to bring up another point – about yourself, actually!”\n“Oh?”\n“It has been bothering me since our chat with Leàh; I mean, about Rolf. I’ve been asking myself, Bushi, whether you would be as keen as her to spend the rest of life in Israel?”\n“My training is for a legal career at the Israeli Bar.”\n“True. But – socially – aren’t you more at home abroad than in Israel? I watched you throughout the trip, Bushi. You were more self assured in Istanbul, Athens, Rome and here than back in Tel Aviv. You fitted into all foreign environments without effort: more readily than on social occasions at home. I remembered how awkward you were at my officers corps party. And you were always relieved when a Kumsitz was over. Am I right?”\n“You may be right,” I conceded.\n“But why, Bushi?”\n“Outside Israel nobody expect me to conform. I can do as I like – that is, within reason and as long as I don’t break the law. At home, you have to fit in; and I’m not really ‘with it’, Pilkin!”\n“And you are a non-conformist at heart – you demonstrated it in the Josephus trial!”\n“I am. And I don’t think I’ll change my outlook!”\n“Which means that if you find a good opening away from home you might go ahead.”\n“I might. I said so to Leàh. Well do you condemn me as a Yored – a deserter or renegade?”\nFor once, Pilkin hesitated. Acting out of character, he chose his words with extreme care, as people do when they tread on thin ice. I realised he feared that any blunt words, be they as innocent as may be, might hurt my sensitivities. Like myself, he was aware that, despite the closeness that had grown between us, a certain gap – an unseen barrier – had remained in place.\n“No, Bushi,” he said at long last. “I don’t sit in judgment. You have the right to make your own choice. But you are my friend. And so I want to make sure we won’t lose track of one another even if – in years to come – we take diverse routes!”\n“What do you suggest?”\n“Let’s have a rendezvous! In precisely 40 years from today we meet again here in Zermatt for a reunion dinner! We’ll tell one another our life stories without camouflage. And we’ll follow these up with a post mortem. If both of us are still in Israel, we can travel together. But if you live abroad, each of us makes his separate way to this place.”\n“But, Pilkin, we’ll be in our sixties – two aging men! Will we recognise one another?”\n“Perhaps not. But this can be taken care of. We’ll have our dinner in the Zermattschein! And I’ll book our table in you name!”\n“Why not in yours?”\n“Because I might change it!”\n“Again? You’ve already dropped ‘Rosenberg’ and picked up “Rosenne’?”\n“But every ‘Rosenberg’, ‘Rosenzweig’, ‘Rosenbaum’, ‘Rosneblum’ and ‘Rosen-I-know-not- what’ goes for ‘Rosenne’. It’ll soon be an Israeli ‘Schmidt’ or ‘Brown’!”\n“Well, there are plenty of ‘Bergers’. But I’m going to stick to it. If it was good enough for my grandfather, it’s good enough for me! A name’s not a label!”\n“To my mind, it’s nothing but a label, bestowed on many of our ancestors by capricious European rulers. Still, in many ways you, Bushi, are a Tory! So it’ll be safer to book the table under ‘Eli’, or – better still – under ‘Peter Berger’.”\n“But suppose the Zermattschein is no longer there?”\n“Then I’ll look around for a good restaurant and I’ll leave a message for you at the Tourist Information Centre. Well, how about it then?”\n“It’s a deal! And it’ll be a fascinating evening. But, Pilkin,” I wished to get things straight, “this rendezvous does not mean we have to avoid one another when we are in Israel?”\n“Of course not. But regardless of what the future has in store for us: in forty years precisely we meet in Zermatt.”\n“I’ll look forward to the occasion,” I assured him.\nThe object of my trip to Zermatt, forty years thereafter, was to keep our rendezvous. As I entered the restaurant on the Riffelalp, as a grey faced man in his sixties, I recalled vividly the unforgettable conversation we had in our youth.\nI also recalled our parting in the railway station on the last morning of our anabasis. I was about to board a train to Zürich and onward to Vienna, where I planned to spend a few days with my father. Pilkin had decided to proceed to Paris: he wanted to familiarise himself with the French stage! Thereafter, he planned to proceed to London. Each of us had been ready to embark on our respective journeys.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/reunion-in-zermatt/chapter-7/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"1-leah\"\u003e1.

Apart from the flowers – a lovely bunch of Dahlias – I was going to take with me a copy of the manuscript. She had prompted me to write my autobiography. It was, accordingly, only right to bring her a copy.\nI was about to leave the cottage when I heard Yentl’s voice. Speaking loud and clear, she told me:\n“Where are you going, Loeb?”\n“To visit you, don’t you know?”\n“I thought as much. Not on such a day, Loeb!”\n“But I go every week.”\n“I know. But do you really think I am there? Surely, you know that all that is left there is a skeleton. I – my spirit – dwells here, with you, Loeb.”\nI looked around me with uncertainty. For all practical purposes she was right. Yentl’s spirit – the force that drove me on since the day we married – had become part of me. At the same time, I realised that I was alone in the sitting room. Was I having a hallucination, a mirage? Was I losing my sanity?\n“Of course not,” she assured me. “You are rational and composed. But remember: we had a lengthy and happy marriage. In the course of it my soul merged with yours.”\n“But I am used to my morning walk on Shabbat; and what shall I do with these flowers and with the manuscript?”\n“Bringing them to the cemetery would be stupid. The flowers would crumble and your manuscript would be soaked; and you, Loeb, might catch a chill.”\n“I seldom catch a cold,” I reminded her, “but you are right about the flowers and the tome. Well, what shall I do with them?”\n“Put the flowers in the vase we bought in Venice; they are lovely and this way I will enjoy them. As to the manuscript: you can do with an extra copy. You can archive it in the local library. Who knows what the future holds for us. And as to your never catching colds, do remember that you are an aging fellow and your immune system is not as good as it used to be. You had a bad attack of bronchitis a few years ago. And don’t tell me it was just a chill.”\nYentl’s words made sense. After the flowers were in the vase and the copy of the manuscript in a drawer of my desk, I looked out the window. It was now pouring heavily.\n“You see?” Yentl told me. “Lucky you didn’t go to the cemetery.”\n“I have to agree.”\n“And you, Loeb, enjoyed traversing your life story, didn’t you?”\n“I did. It wasn’t easy. I do have skeletons in my cupboard. I had to lay myself bare.”\n“You did; but, then, who doesn’t have to reproach himself or herself from time to time? I can’t think of any man or woman who may consider himself or herself pure and free of error.”\n“I agree. Still, people usually prefer to remain anonymous. A person writes an autobiography only if he or she wants to brag or to concede and apologise for errors.”\n“There can be another reason, I think.”\n“Tell me, please.”\n“A person may want to get it all off his or her chest.”\n“I suspect this applies in my case.”\n“It does, rather. You see, I prompted you to write it because you were becoming so irritable and felt empty.”\n“I don’t feel this way any longer,” I assured her.\n“In that case, the process of writing was therapeutic. I had hoped all along that it would be.”\nYentl’s last words struck a chord. Before I had embarked on the project – on writing an account of my life – I was becoming a disgruntled old man. Notwithstanding my love for Ruth, I was curt when she called me. I suspect that I was annoyed by her invariably turning up on her own. By now, I have come to understand that my very behaviour might have dissuaded her from bringing my grandchildren and her husband with her. In addition, it dawned on me that the latter might have decided to stay put so as to minimize expenditure.\nI also recalled how I failed to open Ami’s letter. I thought he was begging for money. I was pleasantly surprised when I realised that his business was thriving. I was happy that he made a point of repaying the money I had lent him. Gladly I gave some of it to Ruth. I knew that her husband’s business was struggling.\n“So you see, Loeb,” Yentl’s spirit told me, “the writing process enabled you to revert to yourself. Once again you became a tolerant and generous friend and father. Gone were the wrinkles of your soul.”\nFor a few moments I closed my eyes and reflected silently. When I opened them I saw Yentl sitting beside me. She looked as she did when I first met her. She became, once again, the girl who played Miriam – Tevyeh the Milkman’s wife. Startled, I rubbed my eyes and blinked. When I look around me again, she – or her image – was gone. I was alone in the comfortable sitting room.\n“You see, Loeb, you are so attached to me that, occasionally, you see things. But let me assure you: I am with you all the time, especially now.”\n“What is so special about my current existence?”\n“You have traversed your odyssey and notwithstanding the turbulent voyage you arrived home – in Ithaca.”\n“Have I, then, completed my journey?”\n“You alone know the answer. Some travelers enjoy their journey to such an extent that they wish to continue. They remain restless and in search of adventures. Others are happy when they reach their target, for instance, the top of Mount Everest.”\n“I think I belong to this second group. My Indian Summer pleases me.”\n“But you do ponder a great deal about your values?!”\n“In reality this is part and parcel of my comfortable existence.”\n“In that case you have arrived at home.”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novels/bright-lion/part-6/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"17-ithaca\"\u003e17.

The geographic remoteness did not distance Ranjan and me from one another. We corresponded periodically but, of course, had less occasion for exchanges of views and of impressions than during our days in Oxford and in Singapore. Each was preoccupied with his own career. I tried hard to settle in the windy capital of New Zealand. My problems were related mainly to my family life and to the occasional hiccups of academia. Ranjan sought to rise in his home country. His new milieu and environment were alien to me.\nOur next meeting took place when Pat and I broke our journey in Colombo on our way to London. By then three years had passed since my move to Wellington. I felt the need to cement my contacts in the English banking world and to revisit Oxford. The stopover in Sri Lanka was built in principally to ensure that Ranjan and I did not fall apart. Pat, who had taken a strong dislike to Ranjan right from the start, succumbed ungracefully. The price I had to pay was a stopover in her hometown: Medan (in Sumatra). This involved the spending of time with my in-laws, for whom I had little affection. I breathed with relief when the plane left for Singapore’s Paya Lebar Airport, then still known as ‘the new airport’. From there, we flew onwards to Sri Lanka.\nRanjan did not meet us in Colombo’s modest airport. He was in court but asked one of his pupils to escort us to the hotel he had booked for us. Next morning the same junior gave us a guided tour of ever changing Colombo and then drove us to the seat of justice to watch the proceedings in the crowded, poorly ventilated, courtroom.\nWhen we arrived, Ranjan was attending to the settlement of his case. The leader in the proceedings – a portly and ageing local Queen’s Counsel – nodded his approval when the deal was presented to him and went back to his chambers to prepare his fee note. We proceeded to a sumptuous lunch in one of the restaurants adjacent to our hotel.\n“Why haven’t you taken silk, Ranjan? Being a Q.C. manifests success, doesn’t it?” I asked as soon as Pat returned to our hotel for a rest.\n“I make good money as a Junior, appearing on my own,” grinned Ranjan. “If I were to take silk, I would get less work because I would have to take juniors when I got a case. Clients may shrink when being made aware of the extra cost. There’s no point in losing money for the sake of a title!”\n“But are you making enough?” I wanted to know.\n“I do, and I see no need to take silk. I’ll get into politics before long.”\nRanjan’s reply dd not surprise me. I knew he wanted to get into local politics in a big way. His aim was not the back bench or even a junior post in cabinet. Right from the start he had set his target high. His eye was – I felt certain – on the top job.\n“But then why not take silk, get elevated to the Bench and proceed from there? Isn’t it a safe route?”\n“If one planned a move into a minor seat on cabinet, it might be a good route. But that’s not what I want. A minor position does not confer real influence on the future of the country.”\n“I understand,” I told him.\nRanjan had declared himself. A successful career as a junior barrister provided the best route; and it enabled him to retain his freedom of action. Once he took silk – accepted an elevation to the rank of Queen’s Counsel – his freedom of action would be subject to local conventions. He had no wish to chain his muse.\n“But, then, why do you need so much money? I’m sure you don’t squander it or even spend much of it.”\n“Of course not; I keep it. I’ll need it to reform our failing systems when I am right at the top!”\n“But suppose your currency is devalued, the joke would be on you!”\n“If I kept the money here,” he agreed. “But don’t you remember? Years ago you introduced me to those nice Swiss bankers. The money is with them – invested in diverse currencies.”\n“How do you get the dough out of the country?” I asked naively.\n“There are ways and means: you ought to know. And, actually, I may ask our good Bank to send me an evaluation of the portfolio care of your address. I’ll get it when I come over and visit you. Having it sent to Sri Lanka isn’t safe!”\nI looked at him with respect. He was laying the foundation for the big leap forward. Sooner or later an opening would present itself. Like myself, he had faith in Fortuna. Until she smiled, he would bide his time. One question, though, remained unanswered. Ranjan was no longer a youngster just out of Oxford. Middle age was just around the corner. Why, then, did he remain on his own? When would he get married and start a family? Quite apart from general trends – especially in Asian societies – he had sound policy reasons for getting settled. An ageing bachelor was looked upon with suspicion in political circles.\n“You wonder why I’m still single,” observed Ranjan.\n“Well yes; I do – rather. And you, Ranjan, have always been a ladies’ man!”\n“You mean ‘a womaniser,’” he grinned. “Why not call a spade a spade.”\n“Well?”\n“I am in a quandary. Each of the influential clans in Sri Lanka wants me to marry one of their eligible girls. How am I to know which clan will win?”\n“But you can’t just stay on your own; you love female company!”\n“There are plenty of willing Burgher girls around; emancipated girls.”\nRanjan was having the best of the existing Sri Lankan worlds. The Sinhalese influential clans would continue to send out signals. Fooling with one of their girls would, however, be unwise. Before long he would have to tie the knot and, in the process, get committed to the interests of her family. Tamil girls were best left alone. I recalled that in his Singapore days, Ranjan had been seen with a singularly attractive Tamil air hostess. In Sri Lanka, Tamil girls were out of bounds. The race had its own political agenda and was hated by the Sinhalese majority. Getting attached to one of their women would be tantamount to political suicide. In contrast, the Burgher community – the descendants of mixed marriages of Dutchmen and local girls – did not constitute a factor in politics. Dating their girls had no political significance.\n“But how is all this going to affect your respectability,” I persisted. “And how about children – don’t you want to have any?”\n“Of course I do; but I am still biding my time. I have a few years to play with.”\n“Does your family agree?”\n“Grudgingly,” he grinned. “But I have learned to dodge their manoeuvres.”\nRanjan’ eyes reflected his amusement. For a while both of us kept our silence. Ranjan’s thoughts, I sensed, had moved in a different direction. When he formed his words, he said with the directness, acceptable in a friendship: “So that’s my story. What about you, Peter?”\n“Professionally, I’ve no complaints. I’m getting there.”\n“I understand. The articles you keep sending me are excellent; and published in the right periodicals. But how about your private life?”\nHis question did not take me by surprise. During lunch, his perceptive eyes had kept shifting from Pat to me and back. I knew he had noticed the lack of warmth between us. Had he worked out that, notwithstanding appearances, both of us were unhappy?\nKnowing that he was far more down to earth than I, it seemed best to confide in him. After a while he asked, in plain language, whether I had considered a separation. Would it not be the best solution?\n“It might be; but there is the risk of jumping from the frying pan into the fire!”\n“But the frying pan, Peter, produces enough heat to suffocate you in due course.”\nWe said no more about this subject. The discussion had its effect. It convinced me that Ranjan had remained a reliable and caring friend.\nWe spent the rest of the afternoon talking about Ranjan’s current cases, about my forthcoming book and about world affairs. Ranjan looked at me with surprise when I expressed my misgivings about the future of my home country. I was not certain whether he was taken aback by my reasoning or by my candour. Ranjan, I knew, was used to keeping radical ideas to himself.\nAt dusk, Pat rejoined us. We had a splendid dinner in a Chinese restaurant but returned to our hotel early. Ranjan had to fine tune his argument for an appearance in court and we had to get ready for our early morning flight.\nDuring my next few years in Wellington, Ranjan and I continued our sporadic correspondence. He remained a junior barrister, commanding high fees. I continued to publish articles and chapters in books on commercial law. What kept our friendship going were our frank exchanges about people and world affairs. I cried on his shoulder when things turned sour at work. He referred, with irony but a touch of bitterness, to the ruling party’s attempts to keep him “in place”.\nHis bickering came to an end when he was invited by the then President of Sri Lanka, to stand as the party’s candidate in a by-election occasioned by the death of the incumbent. Although the seat had been held by the opposition, Ranjan managed to swing the voters.\n“I have opened sesame,” he wrote with gusto.\n“Beware of the robbers,” I wrote back. “You never know when they lurk around the corner.”\nThe next communication was an invitation to Ranjan’s wedding. The bride’s name puzzled me. It was not a Sinhalese surname. For a moment, I wondered whether it could be a Burgher name. A colleague in our Asian Studies department gave me the answer.\n“It’s a Parsee name, Peter.”\n“I didn’t know Sri Lanka had a Parsee community?”\n“It’s a small clan; but wealthy!”\n“Where do they stand politically?” I enquired.\n“They keep out of politics!”\nSo Ranjan had married money and, at the same time, avoided a political liaison. With a Parsee wife by his side, he could support either group. The opposition as well as the ruling party would continue to court him. True, he was a Tory MP. But, at this stage, he could still switch sides without being condemned as a turncoat.\nAirfares were still expensive in those days. Pat and I did not attend his wedding; but we sent a valuable gift. In reality, both of us were pleased to give the ceremony a miss. Pat had no wish to see Ranjan again; and I feared awkward moments. My tactless tongue, in particular, was a cause for concern.\nRanjan and I continued to exchange letters two or three times a year. To my growing concern there was no news about a family. Had they decided to wait for a while? Ranjan was now middle-aged and his wife was not a lass just out of school. But my discreet questions on the subject of children remained unanswered.\nRanjan shed light on the subject when he came over to Wellington, some four years after our stopover in Colombo. He had remained a good-looking, vibrant man but his temples were now interlaced with grey hair. He looked tired after his long night flight and shivered when engulfed by the cold breeze in the lofty airport. Still, he settled after a cup of hot coffee and a hearty breakfast in our home. Having gone meticulously through the papers sent to him at my address by our Swiss bank, he relaxed.\nFor a while we talked shop. It pleased me to hear that the corridors of power had opened up. Having turned down a minor sinecure, he had been promised a major place in the cabinet if his party won the next election. Biding his time, he continued to make good money at the Bar. After securing his Ministry, he intended to take silk. It would then be in the nature of an honorary elevation because – in Sri Lanka as in England – a Minister was barred from practice.\n“On the professional side, you’ve brought your ship home,” I told him when Pat went out to attend to an errand.\n“Well,” he replied with becoming modesty, “I am on the way up, as they say.”\n“And how about your ….” I started.\n“My family life?” he grinned.\n“Well, you haven’t said anything about children.”\n“You did ask – not too indirectly – in your last two letters!”\nSo he had evaded the issue. For just a moment I tried to find a way to change the subject. Ranjan had the right to keep any friend – remote or close – out of his private affairs. Ranjan’s expression, though, told me he wanted to unburden himself. With some hesitation, I persevered:\n“Well, don’t you want a family?”\n“I do; although I’m not so sure about Puss.”\n“Is that the problem?” I ventured.\n“In a way, perhaps. But – you see – my marriage has not been consummated!” He did not flinch as he spoke. I, in contrast, averted my eyes.\n“That,” I said feebly when I recovered, “that has never occurred to me. What on earth is the matter? Aren’t you … getting on?”\n“We get on fine,” he replied with a touch of pomp. “Our petting is beautiful; and she responds; but when I want to get on with it, she won’t let me!”\n“How long has this been going on for?”\n“Well – as you know – we have been married for about two years.”\nI looked at him in amazement. Ranjan was an old campaigner. Quite apart from Lillo and Lydia, he had enjoyed the embraces of many Western and Asian women. What had led to his failure with his own wife? True, Asian girls from good backgrounds valued their ‘purity’. But once they tied the knot, they often worked their husbands hard.\n“I can’t understand,” I said after a pause. “Is something wrong with one of you?”\n“Oh, I haven’t become impotent,” Ranjan smiled tightly. “And she has no pathological problems. It is something psychological on her part.”\n“How does she put it?”\n“She doesn’t say ‘no’; she says she has a headache or is tired – and would I mind waiting.”\n“Have you discussed this with a doctor?”\n“The nerve specialists say there’s nothing they can do; they’ve asked me to be patient. An old school mate – now a gynaecologist – gave me a good old common sense piece of advice.”\n“Eh?”\n“He said: force her!”\nRanjan was unable to adopt this basic approach. He was, of course, aware that some pressure may have to be used in certain situations. But the use of brute force in an intimate relationship was beyond him. In the event, he adopted the course suggested by the nerve specialists. Still, the wear and tear of the awkward relationship left it marks. Some of his self-assurance and exuberance – his patent lust for life – had peeled off.\n“Don’t tell me you lead the life of a celibate,” I muttered.\n“Of course not; there are plenty of willing women around – girls who lost their virginity a long time ago. So I’m not … lonely. But I have to be discreet; and I hate this bloody predicament. I’d rather stick to Puss and have children with her. I’m fed up with these stupid affairs; and I’ve come to hate peccadilloes.”\n“What are you going to do?” I asked, suspecting he faced an impasse.\n“I’ve no idea, Peter. At the moment, politics take up all my time. So I’m trying not to think about this business.”\nWe spent ten days driving through the South Island. Notwithstanding her general dislike for New Zealand, even Pat enjoyed the scenery. Ranjan and I shared the challenging drive along the magnificent, under populated, West Coast. I was relieved when he offered to take the driver’s seat when the car climbed through the Haast Pass into Central Otago, where we admired Queenstown, the lakes and the untamed mountains. I found the drive up the steep road leading to the Mount Cook resort breathtaking yet not dangerous; but I was overcome by airsickness when we took a helicopter to the proud and desolate Tasman glacier. After three days in the resort, we proceeded to Dunedin, from there onto Christchurch, and then back to Wellington.\nThroughout the ten exciting days of the trip, Ranjan did not refer to my personal life. But as I drove him to the airport for his flight back to Colombo, he observed with the usual directness we had maintained over the years: “So you have decided to stay put?”\n“Well yes, it isn’t easy. But I’ve got used to it.”\n“Why don’t you return to Singapore; the Faculty would love to have you back. And Pat will never settle in New Zealand.”\n“Her main grumble is the isolation of the place – she says it’s too cut off. She wants us to move to a big city in Australia!”\n“Then perhaps it would be best to give it a try.”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/a-candid-obituary/chapter-7/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIt is time to turn back to my years in Wellington.

That these had a major influence on Judah is beyond doubt. In a thesis examining such influences we are told: “Even though the Hebrews had wanted to remain aloof from the world they could not have done so with the alien caravans and armies consistently passing through their very midst.”1 Further, wisdom literature and concepts were spread by mendicant teachers and travellers.2 Civilizations, such as Judah, were getting familiar with the outlook and culture of neighbouring countries, especially as these dominated the Levant, including the fertile crescent, over generations.\nThe Egyptian belief in the afterlife is complex. A human’s body died and was mummified. The spirit rested in the underworld but could rise and observe the world.3 The belief in the afterlife was also manifest in Mesopotamia.4\nThese creeds differ from Judah’s. With its exception, the religions of the ancient world were polytheistic. It was, thus, possible to designate a deity (or God) in charge of the underworld. Osiris and Hades come to mind. The belief in a single, all mighty, God necessitated a different approach.\nNotably, belief in an underworld (or She’ol) manifested itself in the Old Testament even prior to the composition of Job. By way of illustration, Samuel was ‘raised’ by the Witch of Ein-Dor [Samuel A, 28:6-20]. Angrily, he tells Sha’ul: “Why hast though disquieted me [הרגזתני], to bring me up?” [Id.:15] By implication, the ‘underworld’ is a place of peace.\nIn the 8th century BCE, the prophet Amos tells us that if sinners “dig into She’ol, from there shall my hand take them” [Amos 9:2]. Obviously, God – and no other – is master of the place; and he can raise souls from there.5 At the same time, the Psalms ask: “in She’ol who shall give thee thanks?”6\nJob’s concept of She’ol is in tandem with the prevailing outlook. When bemoaning his sufferings, Job tells us that, unlike in this world, “there [in She’ol] the wicked cease from troubling: and there the weary are at rest. There the prisoners are at ease together; they hear not the voice of the slaver driver. The small and the great are there; and the slave is free from his master” [3:17-18].\nWhen a person descends to She’ol, he does not usually rise [7:9]. This point is underscored in the second round of debates. Job tells us that, “there is hope for a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that its tender branch will not cease. Though its root grows old in the earth, and its stock die in the ground: yet through the scent of water it will bud and bring forth boughs like a plant.”[14:7-9] He then asks, rhetorically: “If a man die, shall he live again?”7\nAt the same time, Job does not doubts God’s supremacy and his ability to bring the dead back to life. He says to God: “Oh that though wouldst hide me in She’ol, that thou wouldst keep me secret, until thy wrath is past, that thou wouldst appoint me a set time, and remember me” [14:13]. And, when He does, He can raise Job from She’ol.8\nJob’s three friends do not express a divergent view. Zofar tells Job: “deeper than She’ol, what canst though do?” [11:8] He does not suggest that Job’s view of She’ol, as expressed in chap. 3, is inaccurate or misguided.\nOf particular interest is chapter 28. As argued, this chapter was, in all probability, not part of the original text of Job. It was, however, included in the tome due to an error made either by the redactor or by a copier. It does reflect the view taken in antiquity of She’ol. In the eulogy of wisdom [28:12-28], we are told: “The depth says, it is not in me.”9 Accordingly, She’ol is not the domain of wisdom.\nA similar view is express by the Ecclesiast, who tells us: “What ever thou hand finds to do, do it with thy strength, for there is no work, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in She’ol” [9:10]. She’ol is a place of darkness. Whilst an analyses seeking to date this book is outside the scope of this paper, it is safe to assume that the MT version of Ecclesiast is not earlier than Job’s.\nThe conclusion is that She’ol is a place of darkness where the souls of the dead are deposited. Whilst God has the power to raise them, Job does not manifest a belief in reward or punishment after death. In other words, She’ol is not hell; and there is no mention of Eden.\nB.M.

After three years, I returned to England for a few months to carry out further research of English banking practice.\nThe first person I called on when I arrived in London was Dennis Gray. He had aged during the ensuing three years and was getting ready to retire in a small village near Bath. Was it his place of birth? I thought it best not to enquire.\nA few days later I went up to Oxford for a spell in the Bodleian Law Reading Rooms. Naturally, I went to have a meal in Jack’s pub near New College. To my surprise, Jack was no longer there. The new bartender, who looked a bit like Jack, was in his mid-thirties.\n“Where is Jack?”\n“You wouldn’t be one of his old customers?”\n“As a matter of fact, I am. I was away for some three years.”\n“I am afraid I have bad news. Dad passed away about a year ago.”\n“I am shocked,” I told him when I recovered my voice. “But please tell me: what on earth happened? Jack was in his prime and I thought he was a healthy and fit fellow.”\n“He was, rather. Still, he drank the beer-spills when he got the barrels ready each morning.”\n“But that stuff is poison: full of lead. He must have known this.”\n“I am afraid he knew. But he used to say it was still beer. The end was kidney failure.”\n“How awful,” I stammered.\n“Are you by any chance the fellow from Israel, who used to work on some banking law topic?” asked Jack’s son, Vince.\n“I am. But how come you are here? Jack did not tell me he expected his son to take the business over?”\n“I left the police force after Dad died. I’ve been running the business ever since.”\nFor a while both of us kept silent. Recovering his composure, Vince treated me to a shandy and invited me to have lunch on the pub.\nI saw him often during the succeeding ten weeks.

I was taking off my gown when Ruth Schwartz’s voice startled me.\n“Why didn’t you stick to your instructions?” Her voice was harsh and her demeanour antagonistic.\n“What on earth do you mean?” I asked angrily. Before Ruth had the time to respond, Rachel approached us.\n“I’ll tell you what she means: she wanted us to lose the case. Well, Rotem did not instruct us to do so. And we should not have accepted such a brief. We are lawyers: not clowns.” Rachel was breathing hard. On occasions, I had seen her irked or annoyed. But she had never lost her temper before.\n“We did not ask you to lose the case,” protested Ruth.\n“Then what is this fuss all about?”\n“We asked you to handle Fischer gently in the witness box.”\n“we did. But Fischer was impudent. So, Ehud Morag took the cross-examination over. And he is not subject to your instructions.”\n“I am told you capitalised on it.”\n“We did!” replied Rachel angrily. “But then, you say you did not instruct us to lose the case. And we didn’t!” Turning to me, she added: “Your address was excellent, Eli. On behalf of Jacob Keren and Associates, I congratulate you! Well done. If Rotem takes exception, they can challenge us! Actually, Jacob Keren intends to raise the nature of these strange instructions at Rotem’s next board meeting.”\nRuth looked at Rachel narrowly: the barb had found its mark. I was by then convinced Ruth had given the instructions without the necessary internal clearance. Regardless of things to come, she was bound to face a storm.\nOur immediate task, though, was to bring the matter to its close. An appeal by the plaintiff would be costly. Even if Rotem won, it might be difficult to recover the costs from an impoverished Fischer. An ex gratia payment might be the best solution.\nI was about to express my sentiment, when Ruth regained her cool. In point of fact, I knew her well from a literary circle. One evening we took opposing roles in a literary trial of Franz Kafka’s Castle. It had been a pleasant and highly civilised occasion. At the end of the debate, all present conceded they found Kafka hard to understand. Both Ruth and I were given an ovation. Ever since, I regarded her a likeable person.\n“Look, Eli. I am sorry I flew off the handle. I did not realise Ehud Morag stepped in. I arrived during your fine address. Can you please tell me what triggered Morag’s wrath? He hasn’t been the same man for the last two years.” Ruth’s voiced evinced embarrassment mingled with regrets.\n“He did not appreciate Fischer’s demeanour. Actually, I’m still in the dark. Fischer appeared to sort of look over the Judge’s shoulder. He did it to me too. But I thought he was being awkward. Coming to think of it, he sorts of limped to the box. I asked myself what was the matter with him.”\n“Boaz may be able to tell you now,” said Ruth.\nFor a short while the three of us kept our silence. Then, to my relief, Rachel regained her composure. She emphasised that, if the Court of Appeal disagreed with Morag’s legal analysis, the case would be sent back for a further hearing. An ex gratia payment was the best way out. She thought Fischer might be willing to accept the amount offered to him originally plus an additional sum to cover some of his costs. We concluded it would be best to leave the negotiations in Ruth’s hand.\n“I’m afraid I can’t have lunch with you Eli. Uzi has to attend to a patient who developed some complications. I’ll go back home to prepare him a snack and some sandwiches. He’s got to be at the hospital at 2.30 p.m. and may not be back until late in the evening. Are you free for dinner?”\n“Of course.”\n“Come over to my office at 6.30p.m. I want to back at home at 9.30 p.m.”\n“That should be easy.

If Simha Balani turned down the princely pension Solbon had offered, a lump sum was the proper compensation. What he did with the money was out of our control and, accordingly, not our concern.\nKeren was equally nonchalant about the contributory negligence issue. He agreed that the defence had to be pleaded. A contribution of 20 per cent would have been preferable but 15 per cent was appropriate. His one admonition was that I refrain from pressing Solbon and Rotem to drop the defence. Simha had been aware it would be raised and we – the firm of Jacob Keren and Associates – represented the defendants – not Simha Balani. A decision not to pursue the defence of contributory negligence had to come from the clients and be made at their initiative.\nRachel’s reaction was more contemplative. She was surprised that Malka Balani had assumed the courage to voice an opinion. A good Sephardic wife would take such a step only if she had no confidence at all in Shimon’s judgment and ability.\n“But even so, she did not assert herself,” I pointed out.\n“Of course not. Very few women – Oriental or Occidental – would. It may be wrong; but that’s the way it is!”\n“Although she will have to bear the brunt of looking after Simha on her own if his compensation is frittered away by that son of his?”\n“I am afraid so; unless, of course, she ran away. But women like her usually don’t. She’ll suffer silently and without complaint.”\n“But then, Rachel, Simha ain’t a fool. He knows all this. I suspect he even knows that Shimon is a simpleton. So why doesn’t he put his foot down: for Malka’s sake if not his own?”\n“Doesn’t want to lose his son’s regard! A parent often forgives his child …\n“… the prodigal son motive!” I broke in.\n“Precisely. But, you know, I have never heard any mention of a prodigal father! If a parent loses his son’s or his daughter’s love or natural affection, he is not readily forgiven! You see, Eli, I had never forgiven my father. In my last year at law school, he came to see me with the hope of a reconciliation. Well, I threw him out.”\n“Why?”\n“Because a child has expectations from his parents. They are the essence of its life. It does not necessarily work the other way round. A parent cannot come back to the family he deserted. You see, a good parent is terrified of forfeiting his child’s affection. Usually, a parent will walk an extra mile to please his child: even if his mind tells him he is making a mistake.”\n“So that is Simha’s weak point in the instant case.”\n“I fear it is. Just as ‘don’t interfere’ is the motto of poor Malka.”\n“So – all in all – nothing can be done!” I pointed out.\n“Not as the law stands, unless our courts depart from English precedents. And, Eli, you better remember you are acting for Rotem and Solbon. Let your good friend Boaz look after Simha’s interests. It is his function.

Our pre-trial hearing with Baruch Shoham took place on a wet and chilly day. Unlike the sparkling conference table in Morag’s ante chamber, Shoham’s plain table was covered with books, untidily strewn files and proofs of articles to be published in The Advocate, which he edited for our Law Society. As we entered, he raised his eyes from the document in front of him and beckoned us to sit down.\n“I\u0026rsquo;m glad you are well again, Mr. Tamir,” he said warmly. “I was extremely sorry to hear about your ailment. Hepatitis is a nasty thing!”\n“It is indeed, Judge,” affirmed Boaz.\n“My wife had it shortly after we fled from Germany. She was down for some eight weeks! I hope medicine has made some progress since then!”\n“I suppose it has. But, even so, it took me seven weeks to get over it!”\n“Still, all’s well that ends well. I hope you will stick to the diet prescribed by your doctor. We must never take chances with our health! You do agree, don’t you?”\n“Of course,” said Boaz, smiling gratefully.\nDuring this brief exchange, and the next few minutes in which Shoham gathered his thoughts as he leafed through the file, my eyes moved keenly between the two men. Boaz would have resented the very same sentiments if expressed by another person in authority, such a Ehood Morag. Inwardly, he would have dubbed the speaker a patronising ass. The warm smile which had crept over his face when he answered Shoham, convinced me that no such thought had crossed his mind on this occasion.\nGrinning to myself, I concluded that, like many Yekkes, Baruch Shoham had a way with people. Despite his beaked nose, inordinately long ears, bald head and nondescript countenance, he was liked and respected by everyone who worked with him. His associate doted on him and his secretary stayed behind for long hours to finish her work without expecting overtime pay. Most lawyers in Tel Aviv were delighted when their cases were set down before him. I recalled with amusement how, at the end one of his customary tirades against the ‘bloody Yekkes’, Keren added: “thank goodness there are some exceptions, like Baruch Shoham.”\nIn more than one way, this general esteem was surprising. To start with, Baruch Shoham was a stickler to the rules. Unlike other judges, who would occasionally use shortcuts in order to expedite hearings, Shoham believed in leaving no procedural or substantive issue unresolved. Occasionally, this was both unnecessary and pedantic. His pleasant manner alone saved him from critical comments.\nThe other handicap that Baruch Shoham had to overcome in order to gain the respect of the young but vigorous Israeli Bar related to his legal background. Shortly after the end of the First World War, Markus Edelstein – as he was then known – studied law and economics in Heidelberg. After two years in Berlin, he moved to Darmstadt and started to practise on his own. His business flourished but, reading the writing on the wall, he sold out in 1936 and migrated to Palestine. After years of pupillage and studies, he was called to the local Bar. By then he had acquired a sound, even if rather basic, understanding of the English common law which had been engrafted onto the Turkish Law of Palestine. The general consensus was that, notwithstanding his alien credentials, Baruch Shoham functioned efficiently in this complex legal environment. At heart, though, he remained a civilian lawyer. In his own words: “Policy must emerge from general principles. To ascertain it from an amorphous mass of rigidly construed decisions and piecemeal determinations is unscientific and unsound!”\nOrdinarily, such pronouncements would have antagonised the luminaries of the local profession, most of whom had qualified after studies for the English Bar qualification. What saved Baruch Shoham from their censure was his masterful handling of all cases tried by him. Even where matters were complex and the subject of conflicting evidence, his analysis of the facts remained superb. No detail in any document, deposition, expert’s report or testimony escaped his attention. And his ability to get to the heart of the matter was phenomenal. It was, generally, thought that this flair made up for certain shortcomings in his analysis of fine points of law.\nWhen Shoham raised his eyes from the Omri Tal file, he smiled warmly at both of us. “I don’t think you left any point uncovered, Gentlemen. And I am relieved to note that the parties have agreed on a fifty-fifty apportionment of liability. We’ll save at least one morning this way. But may I make one suggestion?”\n“Please, Judge” said Boaz.\n“Well, both of you have been meticulous in asking for and providing ‘further particulars’. I am, of course, all in favour: the issues have crystallises and we’ll have no surprises during the trial. But I think it would be for the best if all the additional details were incorporated in a single of amended pleadings. This way we shall not have to rove from document to document as we go. What do you say?”\n“The thought has crossed our minds,” Boaz volunteered. “We were going to raise it with you.”\n“Splendid. Will two weeks do? You can always come back to me if you are unable to meet the deadline.”\n“What do you think, Eli” asked Boaz.\n“It’s fine with me.”\n“Good,” said Shoham. “The next point I want to raise concerns the reports of the two orthopaedic surgeons. Both conclude that the plaintiff’s progress ought to be monitored. Although the ‘extent of the injury’ is determined as at the time of the accident, the reports confirm that, in our case, the extent of the injuries sustained can be assessed only after a review of the healing process, which varies from person to person. Well, what do you say?”\n“Again, Judge, Eli and I are of the same view. But we have a practical problem. The two surgeons who provided the reports are no longer available. Ours migrated to Canada and Rotem’s man retired for reasons of health. We are trying to find another surgeon, acceptable to both parties. But the three we’ve approached turned us down flat!”\n“Have you tried Dr. Alon Shaked?”\n“He was our first choice,” said Boaz.\n“His receptionist was rather curt!” I grumbled.\n“We may get a different response if I ask Alon Shaked to act as ‘Court’s Expert’. This way he’ll be cross examined only if his report gives rise to controversy. Well, shall I ask my associate to approach him?”\nBoaz was supportive. “Please do, Judge. Do you think it might, perhaps, be possible to prevail on Dr. Shaked to submit his report in eight copies?”\n“That,” said Shoham sadly, “might be the last straw! I suspect many surgeons and physicians refuse to assist us because they hate to get their reports typed, proof read and retyped. But I have another suggestion. A few days ago a new photographic shop opened up in Herzl Street. They use a very modern method. You can get any number of prints within 24 hours. The price is somewhat higher than we are used to but, then, you have to pay for progress. Do you think this will do?”\n“I’m sure it will,” I stepped in. “If, perhaps, your associate could ring me when you get the report, I’ll take it to the shop. I’m sure our clients will be prepared to defray the expenses subject to the order of costs to be made subsequently.”\n“That’s fine with me,” agreed Boaz gratefully.\n“Splendid. And, Gentlemen, you will be interested to know that, before long, problems concerning the production of copies of documents will become a thing of the past! Copies will be produced readily on the premises of every law office and commercial firm!”\n“How?” I wanted to know.\n“According to an American magazine, a new photographic technology will be announced soon. It will enable us to make a copy of a typed or written page by feeding it through the ‘camera’, without first producing a ‘negative’. The entire procedure will take less than 10 seconds per page!”\n“It will revolutionise office practice!” said I.\n“It will. But its introduction will also trigger fresh work for law offices!”\n“Why?”\n“At present you hand your judge a ‘List of Authorities’ just before the trial begins. He has to read them in the library or get his long-suffering associate to haul the books to his Chambers. How long will it take before judges demand that law offices ‘reproduce’ all the authorities cited?”\n“True,” agreed Boaz. “But that manual work can be done by a secretary!”\n“Quite so,” nodded Shoham. “But her boss will have to check that nothing has been left out! But, now, we must turn back to the matter presently before us. Mr. Berger, I understand Frau Hod is no longer with your firm. Are you going to represent Rotem at the trial?”\n“Not on this occasion, Judge. Mr. Keren has asked Hannah Hod to carry on with this case. But I do hope I shall have the pleasure of appearing before you, in Court, on some future occasion.”\n“The pleasure will be mine,” smiled Shoham. “And I shall, of course, be pleased to see Frau Hod in Court this time. So can we perhaps fix the date?”\n“I hope it can be heard soon after we have Dr. Shaked’s report, Judge,” said Boaz. “My client proposes to move to Be\u0026rsquo;er Sheva as soon as the hearing is finished.”\n“Well, we sure ought to try to accommodate him. Will a date early in March be suitable? If the plaintiff sees Alon Shaked next week, we’ll receive the report before the end of this month.”\n“The first week of March is fine for us,” said Boaz.\n“I’ll have to check with Hannah Hod. But, as far as I know, she has no other trial at that time. May I suggest we pencil the dates in, subject to my confirming with her?”\n“Excellent. So we are all set.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/the-luck-of-valentino/part-8/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhen Boaz returned to work, winter was just around the corner.

London was blessed with a number of well-established shops specialising in European ceramics. In addition, many experienced collectors tended to acquire their pieces at auctions. Peppi, though, had learned to bide his time and could afford to be patient. The modest profit made by the end of the second year of the ceramics venture signalled that he was on the right track. A few months thereafter his enterprise gained further momentum when two adjacent porcelain shops closed down. Peppi acquired the stock-in-trade of both dealers and, as anticipated, their customers turned to his shop.\nPeppi benefited from his contact with connoisseurs and from the professional literature available to him. He realised, at the same time, that he had dabbled in porcelain too late in life to acquire a first-class expertise. Lucy, too, remained a dilettante. She was too engrossed in her study of illuminated medieval books to be diverted by a fresh challenge. All the same, father and daughter enjoyed their new pursuit. They attended lectures and exhibitions and made their presence felt at the important porcelain and ceramics auctions. The best pieces they acquired were placed in a show cabinet in Peppi’s own office. Often, at the end of a busy day in the shop, Peppi amused himself by animating the figurines in his mind. He sensed that this trick gave him a special insight into, and an understanding of, the modellers and decorators who had collaborated in the production of his mini sculptures.\nIt was during that period – shortly after Peppi’s eighty-third birthday – that I (Peter Berger) stumbled into his shop. I did not discover Theophil’s Antiques earler mainly because I was living elsewhere. On my occasional visits to London, I went on shopping sprees in Kensington Church Street. But I looked for nothing but mid-European porcelain. Peppi’s original show windows, with their display of silver, tapestries, a limited number of prints and illuminated books, did not attract me.\nThe scene had changed when I came over in 1981. I recall walking distraught down Kensington Church Street, lamenting the closure of my two favourite porcelain shops. Then my gaze fell on the new display at Theophil’s Antiques. I stared in disbelief at two fine Meissen figurines and a Ludwigsburg group. When I recovered, I took a deep breath and entered.\nThe woman in her mid-thirties who came over to greet me was dressed neatly rather than smartly. Her tweed skirt and white blouse were a good match, and her old-fashioned glasses and conservative hairstyle complemented her plain necklace. She appeared ordinary: few men would turn their head as they passed her on the street. My own impression of her, though, was affected by the solemn atmosphere of the discreet shop. She appeared to blend harmoniously into its background – except that her bright keen eyes elevated her a notch above the subdued surroundings.\n“Would you like to see the figurines in the show window? I watched how you stood there lost in your thoughts. You admired them.”\n“Kändler’s drunken peasant is magnificent. So perhaps I’ll have a closer look just at him.”\n“I might as well get all three,” she smiled.\nShe observed me closely as I concentrated on the fine piece. The peasant’s carefree, derisive, leer and his unsteady movements, which made you fear he might topple over as he swung on his feet waving his mug, portrayed his environment and era. He had spent his meagre takings at the fair and would once again be short of cash needed for fodder and fertilizer. But he had no regrets. For weeks he had craved for his binge, would have another one the next market day, and did not reflect for a moment on his conduct and its wisdom.\n“You find him fascinating, don’t you?” she said. I had by then identified her pronounced accent as Bavarian from the Munich area.\n“I do,” I conceded, my eyes still fixed on the figurine. “He is the very antithesis of his creator, Kändler – the sober freemason, conscientious and devoted pater familias and the most prolific and accomplished modeller of all time!”\n“You must be a University Professor,” she said and, as I turned to answer her, I was startled by the twinkle in her eye.\n“As a matter of fact, I am. Sorry for having lectured in this manner.” I let my embarrassment show.\n“I enjoyed it,” she hurried to assure me. “But how do you like the other two pieces?”\n“The pug is fine, except that I already have two similar ones. The Ludwigsburg group is one of the best I have seen. I like it; but I concentrate on Meissen, Vienna and Frankenthal.”\n“Fair enough. Do you have a large collection?”\n“Only about two hundred pieces,” I confided.\n“Only two hundred?” She seemed amused. “And where amongst them would you rank the peasant?”\n“As good as any of my figurines. He is one of Kändler’s masterpieces. Actually, how much is he?”\n“Eight hundred pounds,” she smiled.\n“Eight hundred?” I let my surprise show.\n“Too expensive?”\n“You’d get at least twice as much in a Christie’s auction,” I said impulsively.\n“We never put pieces in auctions. And don’t worry about the price. We got him cheap.”\n“Your supplier must be out of touch with current market prices.”\n“He is an old, eccentric gentleman. He brings us pieces from time to time and tells me how much he wants. We never haggle with him. I suspect he doesn’t care too much about the price, as long as we attend to him forthwith.”\n“Can I pay by Diners Club card?” I asked.\n“I am afraid we don’t accept credit cards. But you can send me a cheque.”\n“I don’t have an account in England. I’ll use my credit card to get cash from the bank around the corner. I’d better give you my calling card: please let me know in case you get further pieces like this.”\n“I certainly will,” she said with a smile.\nWhen I returned with the banknotes, the saleswoman asked forthrightly: “are you by any chance from Vienna?”\n“You guessed from my accent?”\n“That too. But your name is Berger.”\n“Quite a common Jewish name.”\n“I know. But Papa’s best friend in Vienna was a Robert Berger, nicknamed Tommy. And I know he had a son called Peter. It’s a long shot \u0026hellip;” Seeing the change in my expression, she stopped mid-sentence.\n“Tommy Berger was my father’s name. He died a few years ago,” I stammered. “But he never mentioned a friend by the name of von Stölzenfeld.”\n“Have a look at my own card,” she invited.\n“Lucy Stölzl, PhD,” I read out mechanically. “Is your father Peppi Stölzl?!” I asked, my heart pounding in my chest.\n“Just give me a minute while I tell him you are here,” she said.\nPeppi Stölzl was in shirt sleeves. The ravages of time had not corrupted his posture and appearance. He remained as tall and presentable as I had imagined from Dad’s description. True, his hair had turned silver grey, but it had not thinned out; and his bushy mustachio still curled upwards rather rakishly. His skin, too, proclaimed his good health and vigour. Although it reflected his age, it did not have the dry, leathery tinge so noticeable in frail elderly people. The most remarkable feature, though, was the youthful, keen look in his eyes.\n“So, you are Peter’le,” he said warmly. His Otakring accent, which I remembered so well from my early childhood, was music to my ears.\n“I am,” I said, clasping his extended hand. “Dad never told me you changed your name – or that you had been knighted!”\n“Why should he? I’m still Peppi to my friends, old and new alike.” He regarded me keenly, with the expression of one who had found a long lost relative. He then asked: “But which fair wind blew you through the door of our modest enterprise?”\n“He is a collector of porcelain,” volunteered Lucy, whose eyes danced with sheer glee.\n“A porcelain collector? Tommy never told me. He used to go on about your university posts and your legal consultancies.”\n“I didn’t often talk to Dad about my collection. That was, rather, Mother’s department.”\n“I remember,” agreed Peppi. “I used to tread carefully in your old flat in the Oberen Donaustrasse for fear of breaking something. And what do you collect, Peter’le?”\n“Just Meissen and Vienna and a bit of Frankenthal; and, of course, only 18th century.”\n“He told me I was asking too little for our drunken peasant,” volunteered Lucy.\n“The piece brought in by Mr X?”\n“Quite.” A strange expression crept over Peppi’s face.\n“Peter’le,” he asked “what made you come over today? I take it you are in London on a visit. Tommy told me you’re a Professor of Law.”\n“I’m in London on business – my first appearance as an expert witness in a banking case. The other party’s expert is in the box today, and their Silk asked that I be absent. I used the morning for a shopping spree. I was really looking for Herr Wolfsohn’s shop. But it’s no longer there.”\n“He migrated to Israel some time ago,” said Lucy, whose excited eyes flitted between the two of us.\n“What a remarkable coincidence,” I mused. “I looked for another shop and found yours!”\n“We must celebrate!” said Peppi, warmly. “Are you free for lunch?”\n“I certainly am!”\n“I’ll get my jacket.”\nPeppi looked grandiose in his fine suit and neat Italian silk tie. “We’ll catch a taxi on the corner,” he said as we made ready to go.\n“You’re coming with us, aren’t you?” I asked Lucy.\n“No, Cousin Peter,” she said light heartedly. “It’s better if you two boys get acquainted without the burden of female company!”\n“But it’s no burden, Cousin Lucy,” I assured her.\n“You may as well call me ‘Lucy’. But I’m going to call you ‘Cousin Peter’ to make sure the parameters are well defined from the start. And I won’t come with you today. Papa is going to tell you his stories and I’ve heard them a hundred times. I must also make a few telephone calls. Off you go and have a good time.”\n“Are you sure, Lucy?” asked Peppi, concerned. “It’s almost a family reunion.”\n“Next time I will,” said Lucy and the exchange of warm glances between them evidenced their strong bond. I realised that these two might occasionally argue hotly, and might even sulk, but, ultimately, they would stand unflinchingly by one another. It was the type of closeness forged only in the midst of a happy family.\nThe restaurant in Chelsea had an old-world atmosphere, reminiscent of a dining room in the Rathaus [town hall]. Our orders were taken by the chef, who emerged from the kitchen to greet us. Peppi shook hands with him, introduced me as a friend of the family and gossiped with our host for a few minutes.\n“How long have you known this place, Peppi?” I asked.\n“About five years. It’s quiet here during lunchtime. But it livens up in the evening. Some two years ago, Franz wanted to give up the luncheon business. I managed to stop him.”\n“You bought in?”\n“I did indeed. Call it an old man’s whim.”\n“Not such a whim if you enjoy the food!”\nPeppi and I got to know each other during that splendid meal. Peppi had much to tell. I, too, talked. Gently but persistently Peppi steered me through my own story and, from time to time, asked perceptive questions about my career and affiliations.\n“What I don’t understand, Peppi, is why Dad never mentioned that you had moved to London.”\n“Perhaps he liked to talk about our days in Vienna,” he replied, breaking eye contact for a moment. Sensing that he was prevaricating, I pressed him.\n“But Dad moved with the times, Peppi. Believe it or not, he developed a penchant for jazz and rock ‘n’ roll and went to see every new American film! His stories about you, though, ended with that strange affair in Munich. I know you continued to correspond and even rang one another on special occasions. But I don’t think you met again after that day.”\n“You’re right there. You see, Peter’le, our ways parted on ‘that day’.”\n“Because you decided not to return to Vienna?”\n“Partly,” nodded Peppi. “But that was a mere trifle. The main reason was different. But tell me first – what did Tommy tell you about the episode in Munich – the ‘revelation’ as I call it?”\n“Everything, I think.”\n“Did he tell you who appeared to us?”\n“He did. And he said both of you had swigs from that special bottle.”\n“Quite so, Peter’le, except that I had \u0026hellip; a full cup; Tommy took just three nips and stopped.”\n“I don’t understand, Peppi.”\n“I went the whole way, Peter’le. Tommy did not. True, he was deeply moved by what he learned that day. He showed his respect and voiced his gratitude. But he did not board the train.”\n“I’m not sure I fully understand.”\n“Tommy was a conformist at heart. He wanted to remain in the fold. I had no such constraints. I was glad to be freed from a past I wished to put behind me. I have no regrets, Peter’le. Neither did your Dad. Each of us stuck to his decision and followed his own destiny. We remained as close as ever but, all the same, a barrier, or wall, separated our trails.”\n“So this is why Dad liked to think of his Peppi of the old days!”\n“Just as I stuck to my old Tommy! Well, are you still perplexed?”\n“Not at all, Peppi. But tell me, please, is this odd being real? Does Theophil exist?”\n“Can you possibly doubt it?”\n“Have you seen him again since that day? Has he materialised in front of your eyes?”\n“No, Peter’le; I have not seen him since. But I hear him in my head every now and then. On many occasions he has opened my eyes to the truth and has guided my mind in moments of mental strain and indecision. I owe him my good fortune, my inner peace and my ability to persevere!”\n“But does what you hear come from outside your own mind? Aren’t you just listening to your own subconscious?”\n“Tommy and I saw him on the very same occasion, Peter’le.”\n“But, if Dad got it right, you saw him through Dad’s eyes.”\n“In a sense I did. I was fast asleep yet wide awake. But, even so, how could Tommy and I experience the same \u0026hellip; hallucination?”\n“Telepathy has not been scientifically discarded.”\n“What an ardent rationalist you are, Peter’le,” smiled Peppi, with only a trace of sarcasm. “With this approach you can safely dispute each and every premise until proved empirically by material evidence! I understand. But, you know, the universe is not a courtroom!”\n“True; but I won’t accept a premise unless it is proved to my satisfaction.”\n“I see. Yet, you can’t rule it out altogether?”\n“Correct,” I agreed. “I keep an open mind.”\n“You may get your answer, Peter’le, if Theophil sees fit to provide it.”\nI spent a great deal of time with Peppi and Lucy during the remaining days in London. We dined in the Savoy and, one bright evening, walked down to Clarke’s in Kensington Church Street. Initially, Peppi grumbled about the set menu but, when the dishes were served, relished every morsel. When, eventually, my turn came to enter the box as expert witness, Peppi appeared in court and sat through the searching cross-examination.\nWhen I arrived at Theophil’s Antiques the next morning to take my leave, Peppi showed me his study and the cabinet containing his choice porcelain pieces. The sight of them mesmerised me.\n“Are they so very special?” asked Peppi, perplexed. “They are not ‘important pieces’ modelled for courts and the nobility.”\n“No, they aren’t,” I admitted after recovering. “These pieces are the typical wares and figurines modelled for the connoisseurs of the day. Still, today many of them are so rare that you do not find them in standard literature or in catalogues. How did you get them?”\n“Most of them were brought in by a chap we call Mr X. He deals only with Lucy, accepts nothing but cash and lets her have them for a song. She’s tried to pay him more; but he declined.”\nI managed to arrange two further flights to London during the remaining months of that year. Thereafter, I came over to London every ten months or so. At the end of our second reunion, Peppi invited me to stay with them.\n“It’s no trouble, Peter’le. We have a comfortable guest room. Lucy furnished it for Anna and Otto, but they never come. It will be nice to put it to good use.”\n“Do come as often as you can, Cousin Peter,” added Lucy.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-devil-in-munich/chapter-8/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eInitially, Peppi’s new venture attracted limited interest. London was blessed with a number of well-established shops specialising in European ceramics. In addition, many experienced collectors tended to acquire their pieces at auctions. Peppi, though, had learned to bide his time and could afford to be patient. The modest profit made by the end of the second year of the ceramics venture signalled that he was on the right track.

Meandering About Life As I relaxed over lunch in a booth table in the mountain establishment on the Riffelalp, I kept reflecting on the forty years that had passed since the days spent by Pilkin and me in Zermatt. Professionally, I had made it. Although I was not destined to develop into a court room virtuoso, it had not taken me long to rise from strength to strength in Jacob Keren \u0026amp; Associates. Initially, I had worked with Hannah Hod, the scion of an old Jewish family from Hamburg, who was a few years my senior. We won many of our cases and, in the process, developed a good, even if unromantic, friendship.\nWhen Hannah took up the job of in-house counsel at an insurance company, I was assigned to work with Rachel Zeitlin, an attractive woman some seven years older than me. She used to live in Jerusalem but came down to Tel Aviv after her second divorce.\nRachel was a brilliant courtroom tactician whilst my strengths lay in working out the finer legal points of our cases and in spotting the dents in our opponents’ armour. In no time we gained the reputation of a formidable team. After one of our spectacular victories, we became lovers. My sporadic dates with Leàh, whom I had contacted a few weeks after the Zermatt trip, came to an end.\nAfter a few months, Rachel brought our affair to an end. Shortly thereafter I left Israel and read for a doctorate in Oxford. Right from the start, my academic career went from strength to strength. An appointment in Singapore was followed by a Professorship in New Zealand, a better paid Chair in Australia and, eventually, by a return with my Chinese wife to Singapore. Late in life, on the invitation of one of my former students, I took the bold step of moving into private practice. My swelling bank account witnessed my success. So did my substantial collection of works of art.\nI had less to boast of in my personal life. My marriage in Singapore to a Chinese educated girl was unhappy. After years of a strained relationship, no love or affection remained on either side. As both of us were insecure, we simply stuck together. In due course, work became both my escape and relaxation! It was only late in life – after a desperate attempt to salvage my marriage led me back to Singapore – that a friendship, albeit non-physical, with an attractive and highly intelligent woman half my age, brought a few rays of light into my life.\nA glance at my watch told me it was getting late. Having settled the bill, I went back to the mountain train station on the Riffelalp. As I took my seat back to Zermatt, I started to meander on the period preceding my departure from Israel. I had spent these years in Jacob Keren’s firm in Tel Aviv. Pilkin was busy working on his Arts degree in Jerusalem. At the same time, he persevered with his efforts to find a niche on the stage. He had considerable success in comic roles – adding French characters like Tartuffe – to his repertoire. In contrast, his numerous attempts to excel in serious dramatic roles were not crowned with success. He appeared to have a knack for irritating high minded critics.\nAs Pilkin lived in Jerusalem while I was working in Tel Aviv, we saw little of one another during these years. Usually, even my day trips to the Law Library in Jerusalem were too fleeting to provide an opportunity for anything except a brief luncheon engagement in King George Street or a cup of coffee in the late afternoon in the Arts cafeteria. Our only other encounters took place in the weddings of mutual friends and in gatherings of our old classmate of TA.1.\nNone of these occasions gave us the chance for a heart to heart talk. Naturally, Pilkin and I were always glad to see one another. But I was, invariably, disturbed by my friend’s decline. The edge to his smile, the lacklustre of his eyes and his languid expression told their tale. A particular cause for alarm was his demeanour in the party given by Shosh and her husband to celebrate the circumcision of their first son. Pilkin, who used to be the heart and soul of each festivity at school, stood by himself in a corner. His face was set and he drank more than was good for him. Still, I experienced some comfort when he confided that, if he did not have a breakthrough on the stage in the foreseeable future, he would take up the post awaiting him at TA.1.\nSome three months after that occasion, Rachel Zeitlin brought our relationship to its end. In public, I did my best to put up a stiff front. In the privacy of my own room, though, I felt that my world had caved in. Fortunately, I had by then become too experienced a hand to allow any pressure to interfere with my professional commitments. In consequence, my work did not suffer. But my existence in the office, side by side with an estranged Rachel, had become unreal.\nJacob Keren – whose harsh mask disguised a kind heart and sensitive soul – tried to smooth matters over for both of us. One of his ruses was to send me up to Jerusalem, whenever he found a suitable pretext, to carry out research required for complex files. Earlier on, I had been expected to take a train back to Tel Aviv as soon as I finished a project. After my fall, Keren encouraged me to take my time on each matter and, if necessary, take an afternoon off.\nAs the mountain-train sped through the Alpine landscape on its way back to Zermatt, I reflected on the sharp contrast between the everlasting magnificence of the cliffs and chasms and the impermanence of humanity. To me, the scenery appeared identical with the spectacular views that had captivated Pilkin and me forty years earlier. The mountains and the snowy cliffs were – and would remain – in their untouched primeval state. True, the persistent hand of Man had transformed the tracks here and there, had hewn fresh paths out of the rock and had erected new buildings. But the original planners and their workmen had been replaced by a younger generation, which in turn would give way to new men. Indeed, Pilkin and I, who had admired the same eternal view together – each with great expectations at heart – were by now reaching the other end of the tunnel. What had been a life-time to us, was but a fleeting moment in real terms!\n2. Chat with Pilikin prior to my move to Oxford A similar feeling of transience, of inadequacy, had engulfed me years earlier, in Jerusalem, when Jacob Keren’s kindness enabled me to visit Pilkin after I had sorted out a particularly tricky file. Pilkin was at that time sharing a flat on the outskirts of a fine suburb with some acquaintances. As he was not contactable by ‘phone, I had arrived unannounced.\n“So it’s you,” he said as he opened the door.\n“Who else?”\n“Now, now: if I had to wait for your appearances, I should be a very lonely fellow!”\n“Come, come, Pilkin: sarcasm is the lowest form of wit.”\n“Oh, very well then: so come and step into my parlour!”\nAs I sat down on one of the uncomfortable chairs in Pilkin’s ramshackle room, I was distressed by the sparseness of the dilapidated furnishings and by Pilkin’s personal appearance and attire. He was unkempt and unshaved and, despite the chilly weather, wore a shabby vest, a pair of untidy shorts and his bare feet were stuck into old sandals. Noting my apprehensive glance, he closed the window and switched on the electric heater.\n“Thanks,” I said feebly, fastening my leather jacket around me.\n“Don’t mention it. I hope you’re OK?”\n“Of course; and you, Pilkin?”\n“As well as can be expected. But, Bushi, what’s up? Such an unexpected call has a reason!”\n“It has, Pilkin. I’ve come to say goodbye. I leave in a few weeks!”\n“Where to? Vienna?”\n“No, Pilkin: Oxford. I’m enrolling for a doctorate!”\n“I thought you were doing very well in practice?”\n“Well, I am – or was. But this is a new opening; and it’s coming at the right time!”\n“The right time?” he mused. “Oh, I see: is it because Rachel Zeitlin and you have split?”\n“How on earth do you know?”\n“A little bird told me!”\n“What’s her name?”\n“Actually: the source is Rachel’s second ex: Ami Mor!”\n“You know him? Isn’t he in the construction business?”\n“He’s an architect. But his dream is to become a producer. So we’ve … common ground!”\n“And how did he find out?”\n“He still thinks of her!”\n“I see!” For a few moments both of us were immersed in our thoughts. Eventually, Pilkin broke the silence. Looking at me awkwardly, he volunteered: “Bushi; if you want to tell me about it – go ahead. Only don’t you end up resenting me because you blabbered. It happened to me with other friends.”\n“I’m not that perverse. And, yes: I want to tell you about it. I’ve kept mum up to now; and I can’t stand it any longer. But, first, tell me about yourself. How are you doing?”\n“Not too well. You won’t see me on stage in Ha’bimah or the Kameri,” he replied with a shrug, referring to the two leading theatres of Tel Aviv.\n“But you’ve done well as Polonius and as Falstaff!”\n“In minor theatres; amongst amateurs! And the Kameri turned me down for Lennie! I wanted that role; wanted it badly! And have you read that review of my Uncle Vania?”\n“It was unfair! We saw you. You were OK! Still, what’ll you do?”\n“I’m giving myself another five months! If I don’t have a breakthrough, it’s back to TA.1!”\n“Is this so terrible?” I asked, perturbed by his mournful tone. “Ben-Zvi, Frank and that Simple Simon were a happy enough lot!”\n“I know, Bushi. I keep telling myself teaching’s a noble job.”\n“Well?”\n“But I want to be an actor! I crave the limelights, Bushi!”\n“I know! But surely, Pilkin, a good teacher is a bit of an actor! Remember how old Klein used to draw hyperbolas and parabolas in front of him to make his points!”\n“True. Still, teachers and lawyers use acting as a tool – not as an art in itself. And that’s what acting is all about!”\n“But who can get everything he wants, Pilkin?”\n“Have you ever taken a fall, Bushi? Do you know what it feels like?”\n“I do know! I too have taken falls!”\n“In you career?”\n“Yes!”\n“Oh! I thought you wanted to be a lawyer. And, Bushi, here you are – on your way to the top!”\n“It ain’t that simple, Pilkin!”\n“What d’you mean?”\n“I wanted to be courtroom virtuoso, Pilkin – like Jacob Keren!”\n“And?”\n“I haven’t got it in me. My timing is bad and I’m too slow on my feet. My strength is in planning the strategy in tough cases and in booby trapping opponents. I’m good at that! Even better than Keren! But my execution is poor. So I’m bound to remain a support person. And there goes the great dream.”\n“You were pretty good in our Josephus trial!”\n“I was. It was my type of case: turning on unexpected points. And, Pilkin, I booby trapped your ‘corner’, and you didn’t anticipate such tactics. It’s different when the opposition expects them! I get flustered when they punch back! So I need a cool headed leader in front of me!”\n“And for all appearances you remain the backup. Is this why you’re going to Oxford?”\n“It’s one reason. And, of course, I’m a good researcher! Also … well … the split with Rachel. If she hadn’t sent me packing, I should have loved to stay on as her chief-of-staff. And I’ve taught myself to take pride in my role. Nobody wins a case without thoughtful – often ruthless – planning. So someone like me is just as indispensable as Rachel or as Jacob Keren! And so is a good teacher, Pilkin. We were lucky – very lucky – to have outstanding teachers in TA.1!”\n“I get the drift,” muttered Pilkin. “You think I ought to join their ranks!”\n“And you needn’t give up acting. You can teach and remain a prominent part-timer on stage. It’s a compromise – but not such a bad one!”\n“Maybe. Beggars can’t be choosers!”\n“You mustn’t look at it like that, Pilkin. Feeling sorry for oneself is poison!”\n“You are right there. And a classroom full of admiring pupils is an audience – even if captive.”\n3. Pilkin’s Analysis “Very well, then Bushi,” proceeded Pilkin. “That – well – takes care of me. Now, let’s turn to yourself. What do you want to tell me? The split with Rachel?”\n“Yes; and I want your … analysis!”\n“But, Bushi, all I know about Rachel is what I’ve been told by Ami. And I’m sure he’s one eyed! And the only time I saw you with her was about a year ago. You came out of the cinema.”\n“So?”\n“So how can I form an opinion? I don’t want to talk from the top of my head!”\n“But didn’t you notice anything?”\n“Well. Anybody could see you were madly in love with her. And she was responsive!”\n“Anything else?”\n“Isn’t Rachel a bit older than you?”\n“Not significantly!”\n“How old is she?”\n“In her thirties – 34, actually!”\n“And you’re 27!”\n“But she looks so young. And she’s young in spirit!”\n“Maybe; but didn’t the difference in ages crop up in your conversations?”\n“It did, rather. And I always told her it didn’t matter. I assured her again and again I’d be just as much in love with her in ten, in twenty and in thirty years!”\n“I see. But, Bushi, what do you think led to the split? What happened?”\n“I honestly don’t know, Pilkin. I was so happy with her, and I was sure she was just as happy with me. We had been living together for about a year and everything seemed fine; couldn’t be better. And then she told me leave. And I don’t know why. I don’t know why!” I had been trying hard to remain in control but, at this juncture, my resolve failed me. “I want to know why she sent me packing, Pilkin. I’ve got to know; I’ve got to know!”\nPilkin’s eyes opened wide as I blurted the last words in a trembling, shaky, voice. He had seen me in the grasp of severe attacks of Asthma and, on other occasions, fighting panic prior to crucial exams in TA.1. But in none of these ordeals had I lost the grip on myself.\n“But Bushi,” he reasoned when the echo of my scream for help died out, “I told you already: I don’t know enough about Rachel to form a dependable opinion.”\n“Can’t you try?”\n“Alright. But you’ll have to tell me more about your liaison.”\n“What should I tell you?”\n“Just describe how you went through an ordinary day!”\n“I always got up first, Pilkin. Rachel’s a sound sleeper and I’m an early riser …”\n“I remember,” growled Pilkin, whom I had woken up mercilessly in Istanbul, to watch the daily opening-up of the Galata Bridge, and in Athens, to see the sunrise on the Acropolis.\n“Alright, alright,” I retorted. “So you see: I made breakfast: Rachel loves porridge with a bit of sugar and a trace of cinnamon. And it takes some skill and time to cook it! When we finished, Rachel took her time over her toilette. So I washed the dishes. If it was a nice day we walked to the office. If it was cloudy she drove us over!”\n“And then you worked together?”\n“Only in the early and final preparation of a case. Generally, I did my research and opinion work and she handled the clients – took their depositions, prepared the witnesses and so on. But we always had lunch together!”\n“And then you went back to work. Still, you returned home together?”\n“Yes; but often we stopped in the supermarket, or at the grocer. We usually bought some sandwiches or Kebabs or some other stuff. In the evening we went out or just relaxed at home. And, Pilkin, Rachel has a good taste in wine: so on weekends we often drove to a vineyard. In summer we went for swims and sometimes I’d row us for a few hours on the Yarkon! I was so happy with her!”\n“But, Bushi, don’t you think such an existence is claustrophobic?”\n“What do you mean?”\n“From what you tell me, the two of you were always together – day in, day out! Didn’t you fear it might be too much for her?”\n“The thought did cross my mind. So I encouraged her to go out with old friends and to attend all kinds of functions like former school mates’ parties. And when she went to visit her mother in Jerusalem, I came along only if she asked me.”\n“I understand. But whenever she came back there was a hot dish in the oven, or a bunch of flowers or a box of chocolates!”\n“Of course!”\n“I see. And what were your plans for her?”\n“Well, I proposed to her, of course!”\n“What did she say?”\n“That she’d think it over. So I went on proposing; and she kept saying: ‘we’ll see later’.”\n“Humph. But actually, Bushi, that’s not what I was after when I asked about your plans for her. What was the professional target you had in mind for her?”\n“Well … I wanted her to be the first woman Judge on the Israeli Supreme Court. With me by her side she had every chance of getting there. I’m not exaggerating!”\n“And you kept telling her this?”\n“My object was to inspire her!”\n“What was her response?”\n“At the beginning, she treated it as a joke! Later on, she used to say: ‘too high a target, Eli, I’m not sure I want it!’ Occasionally, she just shrugged.”\n“But you persisted?”\n“I raised the subject from time to time: usually after a victory in court!”\n“That’ll do, Bushi. I have a hunch. But, of course, that’s all it is!”\n“Well?”\n“A combination of factors. The difference in age; do you really think it didn’t matter!”\n“It didn’t” I insisted.\n“But any sensible woman in Rachel’s position would have feared the future. Human relations are fluid, and nowadays not too stable! And I do think your relationship was claustrophobic. More often than not women thrive when a relationship is very close and men hate it. But there are exceptions. Ami says she is very independent. Maybe she needed a looser sort of tie.”\n“It is possible. But then – why didn’t she tell me?”\n“Perhaps she lacked the courage, or didn’t want to hurt you. Love can lead to strange results!”\n“Anything else?”\n“Actually, two points. First, your ambitions for her might have frightened her! Tell me, Bushi – can she get there without you?”\n“Not too easily. She’s not so good on the finer legal point. And I’m not sure she has the drive!”\n“So your high target might have put her off?”\n“She didn’t say so! At least – not directly”\n“But indirectly?”\n“Well – perhaps. And, Pilkin – what’s the second point?”\n“Rachel has had two divorces. And Ami told me she had a liaison after her first divorce!”\n“So?”\n“How many girls go through so many relationships in less than twenty years?”\n“To tell you the truth – I can’t think of any.”\n“So isn’t it possible that Rachel Zeitlin is unable to maintain lasting relationships? Maybe she needs change or maybe she keeps things – I mean little resentments and irritations – bottled up inside for too long. When she can’t take them any longer – she walks out.”\n“So it may be a pattern?” I observed after a pause.\n“I think so! So stop flagellating yourself. I suspect the split was on the cards from the word go!”\nPilkin’s tone carried conviction. Even in our school days, he was renowned for keen insights. His objective perception lent support to his words. So did scenes from my life with Rachel, which flickered in front of my eyes as he spoke.\n“Then, perhaps, it’s fortunate it happened now,” I observed.\n“Why?” he wanted to know.\n“Because I have the opening in Oxford. Do you think I should go?”\n“As long as the move makes sense as a career decision. Plainly speaking: I suggest you make your decision without taking Rachel into account!”\n“You think there’s no chance of winning her back?”\n“Based on past and general experience – none!”\n“That in itself is a reason for going!”\n“No, Bushi; it isn’t! You musn’t ‘escape’. Of course, it’s no good for the two of you to work in same office after you’ve broken up. But I’m sure each of you can easily get another job in Israel. So don’t let the split affect your decision on Oxford. Do what’s best for your future!”\n“There can be no doubt on that: Oxford presents a unique opportunity!”\n“Then grab it!”\n“I will. And thanks, Pilkin.”\n“So, you see, we can still help one another. Well, when will you leave Israel?”\n“The Oxford term begins in about six weeks. I’ll have to be there by then.”\n“Which means we’re not likely to meet again before you leave?”\n“True. But, Pilkin, how about a goodbye dinner before I take the train back?”\n“Just have a look at these magazines while I tidy up,” he accepted warmly.\nDespite the worn out appearance of Pilkin’s tee shirt, jacket and trousers, his neatly shaved face and tidy hair gave him a fresh look. As we made our way to the German Colony, I noticed that girls bestowed their glances on him rather than on me. Pilkin, I noted, was lost in his thoughts. During the sumptuous meal, we engaged mainly in small talk and in gossip about old friends. It was only when we enjoyed the delicious chocolate cake, that I took the courage to raise a point that kept bothering me.\n“Pilkin, my experience with Rachel suggests that I’m not too good when it comes to the ‘fair sex’, doesn’t it?”\n“Well?”\n“Do you think it’s a trend I can break?”\n“Time will tell,” he replied, shifting his glance and breaking our eye contact.\n“Tell me the truth, please!”\n“I’m not a prophet, Bushi!”\n“But what do you think?”\n“You do have a problem there. You see, Bushi, after we came back from Zermatt, you went out a few times with Leàh. But nothing came of it!”\n“I didn’t think she was serious about me.”\n“That’s where you are wrong. Leàh’s a worldly girl. She’s out for a good husband: a dependable chap with good career prospects, steady and not too hard to handle. You fit the bill. But you had no idea of what she was after!”\n“I thought she was interested in you? You are far more flamboyant than I would ever be!”\n“I may be. But that’s not what Leàh is after. She has had her fill of mere flirtations. She wants to settle down and start a family!”\n“How’d you know!”\n“I’ve teased her about it. You see, we went out together a few times just for fun and she kept asking about you, far too innocently, I’d say!”\n“I’d no idea. But surely it’s only a one instance?”\n“I can think of a few others. You see, Bushi, you admire ‘glamour women’. But – as far as I can see – you’d be better off with a plain wife who wants to make a career of her home and family. And that would suit you because your real existence is at work. In the long run, a glamour woman would be nuisance!”\n“You are right. So what should I do?”\n“It’s not easy to go against ones nature,” sighed Pilkin. “I’m a showman at heart: that’s why I hate the idea of giving up the stage!”\nA brisk walk took us to the railway station. I sensed that Pilkin had no desire to accompany me to the platform. I recalled that in Zermatt, too, he felt the need to cut our parting short.\n“Bushi,” he asked as I was about to take my leave, “did you tell Rachel Zeitlin about the opening in Oxford?”\n“I did. She sent me packing a week later!”\n“I thought this might be the case. You see, she must have concluded you should not miss the opportunity!”\n“Do you think that’s why she broke off with me?”\n“No, Bushi. But it may have prompted her to make her decision forthwith!”\n“Something like the ‘last straw’ or ‘the point of no return’!”\n“Quite! And this, Bushi, means that a ‘reconciliation’ – if that’s the words – is definitely out!”\n“Coming to think of it, she said it was possible – even probable – I shan’t come back!”\n“So Rachel knows you pretty well. And you should not dream of her when, after you’ve finished your research, you decide what to do. The question will be: where will you be happiest?”\n“Do you think I’ll come back?”\n“I tend to agree with Rachel. Remember, I told you as much in Zermatt!”\n“I remember!”\n“So remember also that we have a rendezvous! Even if we get out of touch with one another, don’t you forget our dinner in the Zermattschein! And, Bushi, I do hope you don’t mind if I walk back now. Lengthy partings are too sentimental for good taste!”\n“I understand. So – if we don’t meet sooner – see you in Zermatt as arranged! And, Pilkin, thanks for everything!”\n“Bye for now – my friend,” he said and walked away without turning back.\n4. Getting out of Touch My parting with Pilkin kept hovering in front of my eyes while the mountain train covered the last few miles to Zermatt. As I walked back to Pension Kegel, through the winding lanes of the resort, I reflected that Pilkin’s two predictions had come true. I had not returned to Israel and, during the years of my self imposed exile, we had got out of touch.\nThis apparent estrangement materialised gradually. Initially, during my years in Oxford and my first years in Singapore, I got news about him from my mother, whom Pilkin visited from time to time after he joined TA.1. I was relieved to glean that, right from the start, Pilkin proved an excellent and popular teacher. His success as an amateur actor was borne out by the numerous newspaper cuttings mother forwarded me.\nA letter she wrote just before my departure from Oxford, referred to Pilkin’s marriage to Galya Hadar, a starlet in the Kameri Theatre. In a subsequent letter, mother told me Pilkin had been appointed one of the founding members of Israel’s Educational Television. Later still, she mentioned TA.1 had seconded Pilkin to this Channel for a two years attachment.\nShortly thereafter mother left Israel and joined my ailing father in Vienna. For a while, I got some scattered news about Pilkin from Shosh, who kept sending me cuttings respecting his performances. Then – to my disappointment – all information dried up. Notwithstanding my direct and indirect enquiries, neither Shosh nor any other mutual friends favoured me with news about Pilkin. It was as if a blanket of silence had descended to widen the gulf separating the two of us.\nPilkin, in contrast, was able to keep tabs on my progress. Throughout our many years of separation, I kept getting sporadic communications from him. Most of them were greeting cards, sent on festive occasions such as the Jewish New Year. Others were plain postcards. The majority bore Israeli stamps and a Tel Aviv postmark. Some, though, came from places as diverse as Acapulco, London, Marakesh, Madrid, New York and St. Petersburg. None of them set out his address.\nUsually these cards were just dated and signed “Pilkin”. In only few did he add a message. For instance, shortly after my marriage, he wrote: “hopefully you will continue to deny the existence of the same God”. During my years in New Zealand, he expressed the hope that I had taken up the national art of sheep shearing, adding that rugby and cricket were too dangerous for a sedate scholar like me. Writing in a more serious vein after my transition to Melbourne, he reminded me that my new abode had a thriving Jewish community. He urged me to forge links with it. “Blood,” he exhorted, “is thicker than water and must not be diluted”. The only message I received after my return to Singapore, was a reminder of our rendezvous.\nThat Pilkin had not reneged on our arrangement was confirmed as soon as I arrived back at Pension Kegel.\n“There is a message for you, Professor Berger. You are expected for dinner in the Zermattschein at 7.00 p.m. sharp. Please give your name to the Concierge when you arrive. He will guide you to your table.”\n“Thanks,” I told her, unable to suppress a happy smile. “I’ll need a wake up call at 6.30 p.m.”\n“Very well!”.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/reunion-in-zermatt/chapter-8/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"1-meandering-about-life\"\u003e1. Meandering About Life\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I relaxed over lunch in a booth table in the mountain establishment on the Riffelalp, I kept reflecting on the forty years that had passed since the days spent by Pilkin and me in Zermatt. Professionally, I had made it. Although I was not destined to develop into a court room virtuoso, it had not taken me long to rise from strength to strength in Jacob Keren \u0026amp; Associates. Initially, I had worked with Hannah Hod,  the scion of an old Jewish family from Hamburg, who was a few years my senior. We won many of our cases and, in the process, developed a good, even if unromantic, friendship.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Chapter 8: Intermezzo"},{"content":"Ranjan was rising in politics, continued to make a fortune at the Bar and laid the foundation for the great leap forward. He refrained from referring to his marriage but once mentioned in passing that there was no sign of a ‘family’. I drew my conclusions.\nMy own life, too, continued uneventfully. Then, one day, Pat spotted an advertisement for a new Chair of Law at Monash University in Melbourne. She nagged me into applying and – with the help of Fortuna – I got the job.\nLife in Monash was tough. My lose, informal, existence in Wellington, which gave me adequate time for my hobbies and research, was replaced by a strenuous role as a teacher cum administrator. My ability to handle people had always been poor. The Chair at Monash was the promotion to my level of incompetence.\nPat, too, had a hard time. In Wellington she had enjoyed the social life of the diplomatic community. She had also been active in pottery – her realm of creativity. Life in Melbourne’s suburbia was dull in comparison. True, Melbourne was a metropolis. But it was not a capital city; the diplomatic core resided in Canberra. In Melbourne, we faced an alien milieu. Slowly but steadily we became isolated – cut off in our elegant but lonely four-bedroom home.\nMonash had a number of foreign staff members. One of them was a Sinhalese from a background similar to Ranjan’s. Whenever Marcus went home to visit his family, he brought me a message of love and friendship from my climbing friend. I gathered from Marcus’ news that Ranjan had taken over the Home Ministry, later on switched to the Ministry of Trade and Industry, and was being tipped for a senior seat in cabinet if his party were to win yet a further election.\n“Any news of a child?” I asked on one occasion.\n“I am afraid not,” said Marcus in a tone that conveyed his being in the know.\nAfter three years of an administrative quagmire at Monash, I felt the need for a break. The Dean, an understanding soul, agreed to grant me a year of no-pay leave to be spent as a Visiting Professor in Singapore.\nDuring the years that had passed, Singapore had metamorphosed from a sleepy port town into a successful business centre. Life had become hectic. The outlook was optimistic, with everybody believing in a rosy future. Ugly but functional skyscrapers had replaced the old gracious colonial architecture of the City. Orchard Road had been turned into a one-way crowded traffic vein; and even Chinatown was getting a facelift. The University, too, had changed. It was in the process of moving into a new campus, had added the word “National” to its name and boasted multidisciplinary courses.\nOne of my new colleagues in Singapore, Allen, was a Sri Lankan Tamil, who had left his home country and settled in Tasmania. From there, he migrated to Singapore. Having remained a staunch supporter of the cause of his Tamil community, he had no liking for the Sinhalese leaders of Sri Lanka. Ranjan, in particular, was an object of his dislike. Allen, who was a few years younger than Ranjan, had attended Ranjan’s old school in Colombo. Ranjan, who used to be postulated as a model to freshmen, had gained Allen’s ire. Right from the beginning, he had seen through Ranjan’s veneer.\n“That fellow is a racist and a bloody hypocrite,” Allen told me one day.\n“Come, come,” I stepped to the defence. “What harm has he done since he entered politics?”\n“You just wait and see,” predicted Allen.\nA few months thereafter, Sri Lanka had a general election. Ranjan’s showing was excellent. He now became a senior member of cabinet. According to conventional wisdom he had emerged as a prospective successor of the ageing President. Not only the Sinhalese but even the Tamil community saw in him the progenitor of a better and more harmonious future. Just for once, he was the darling of all factions.\nI was accordingly taken aback when Allen told me, in unequivocal terms, that Ranjan had been lucky to come up with such a convincing performance. A poorer outcome could have resulted in his having to face a sordid prosecution.\n“Anything to do with money?” I asked.\n“Much worse than that: bodily assault!”\nShortly before the elections, Ranjan’s wife started to go out with a young man of her own community. As Ranjan was busy with his campaign, he probably welcomed the extra time he gained. Everybody believed the relationship was platonic – a simple case of a bored wife going out in a purely friendly manner with somebody she knew. Then, unexpectedly, someone threw acid in that man’s face. He survived the attack but was badly deformed.\n“What has this got to do with Ranjan” I asked.\n“He ambushed the fellow and threw the acid!”\n“I don’t believe it,” I said with fervour. “I don’t believe such a filthy trick would ever cross his mind; and even if it did, he’d never do it himself. And why should he have done it? He must have known she was seen with this fellow?”\n“He found out it wasn’t ‘innocent’!”\n“Bullshit!” I exclaimed.\n“I’m afraid it isn’t,” Allen persisted. “You, Peter, don’t understand Asian people. And, coming to think of it, what would you do if you found out your wife was cheating on you?”\n“Divorce her, unless I decided to close my eyes. And, well, I might have slapped her in the heat of the moment. But throwing acid? Never! Neither would Ranjan!”\nEven as I spoke, I realised that my surmise was the superficial. Ranjan came from a background miles apart from mine. In his milieu men had some licence; wives were supposed to be ‘pure’. In Ranjan’s own case, the situation was exacerbated by his having been denied access. He must have been in turmoil when he realised the truth. He had been tricked and cuckolded. I had known all along that Ranjan’s Hyde was far removed from his Henry Jekyll act; when Edward took over, all hell could break loose. Obviously, it did on this occasion.\n“How do you know it was him?” I asked Allen.\n“The eyewitness got one of our relatives to ask for my advice. I said he should clam up; if he told the police what he had seen, he might be eliminated! The clan would see to it!”\n“Pfui,” I said.\n“Pfui to them,” retorted Allen. “But now you know what lurks beneath the benevolent façade!”\nSo that was that! I could visualise Ranjan’s contorted face and blazing eyes when the acid landed on his victim’s face. Did he smile when the man wriggled in agony? Did he feel that strange release – that revolting satisfaction brought out by a senseless act of revenge – when he transformed a good-looking man into a monstrosity?\n“Did that poor fellow lose his sight?” I wanted to know.\n“One eye is gone; and his face is a mess; and I’m told he lost his reason! Your good friend Ranjan can smirk with satisfaction!”\n“But what did Ranjan’s family and wife do?”\n“They feigned ignorance – pretended not to know. I wonder what they said behind closed doors.”\nA few months later Ranjan went on a state visit throughout South East Asia. I saw him briefly during his two days in Singapore at an official function. We had no chance for a heart-to-heart talk. All he mentioned was that his wife had filed for a divorce.\n“It’s the best way out,” he said evenly. “This way both of us are out of bondage; and we’ve agreed to ‘remain friends’.”\n“Will you remarry?” I ventured.\n“Time will tell; but I do want an heir.”\nHe was about to revert to my problems but his host – a local cabinet member – nudged him back into the hub of the party’s small talk; and I was relieved.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/a-candid-obituary/chapter-8/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eRanjan was rising in politics, continued to make a fortune at the Bar and laid the foundation for the great leap forward.

Many scholars maintain that these are late additions. Vicchio,1 who is of this view, supports it on nine grounds. These can be condensed as follows.\nFirst, Elihu is mentioned neither in the prologue nor in the epilogue. This framework advises that Job’s three friends came to call on him and discussed his misfortunes inter presentem. An outsider like Elihu could reply to the written work but was not a party to the initial debate. Indeed, in the epilogue God refers only to Job’s three friends. Elihu is, thus, conspicuous by his absence from the mainstream of the book.\nSecond, none of the parties to the debate refer to Elihu directly or indirectly. Further, Job does not retort to Elihu’s arguments although some of them cover ground not discussed elsewhere in the book. Taken together, these points establish that Elihu is an outsider or a newcomer who deals with a written text he has read.\nThird, Elihu’s intervention in the first six verses of chapter 32 is the only prose except the compiler’s captions and the setting. If the anonymous author of Job had intended to include Elihu as an integral contributor to the debate, these six verses (with the required alterations) would have been set out in the prologue. Alternatively, a reference to Elihu’s words could have been set out in the epilogue.\nFourth, Elihu quotes Job’s words verbatim.2 In contrast, the three comrades refer to his views but do not cite him.\nFifth, Elihu refers to Job by name.3 The three comrades refrain from doing this, although they address him in second person (e.g., “thou”). This, too, indicates that the relevant chapters [32 – 37] were not written by the author of other parts of the book.\nFinally, Job is renowned for the use of Hapaxes. Vicchio demonstrates that these appear more frequently in Elihu’s speeches (and in cap. 28) than in any other part of the book. Furthermore, the vocabulary and imagery of chapters 32 to 37 differ from the language of the rest of the book.4\nThese points are adequate to support the view that the speeches of Elihu are late additions to the original version of Job. It is also noteworthy that, although the three comrades are gentiles, Elihu’s name and lineage evidence his being Jewish. To start with the name – Elihu (‘El is my God’ [אליהוא]) – is Hebrew. It is akin to Eliyahu [אליהו], the name of the acclaimed prophet, which conveys a similar meaning. Further, detailed pedigrees are set out mainly in late books of the MT (such as Chronicles). They describe the background of members of the tribe and distinguish them from outsiders.\nElihu’s speeches raise a theological point not covered by the three comrades. They, as well as Job, regard suffering as retributive. Elihu argues that God refrains from unjust acts5 and that the sufferings of the innocent are the outcome of a pre-determined divine plan. God alone decides when sufferings are to be inflicted or remedied.\nElihu also takes the view that Job sins by questioning God’s ways. In his own words: “Would that [Job] may be tried to the end because he answers like wicked men. For he adds rebellion to his sin … and multiplies his words against God” [34:36-37].\nThis point of view falls short of the assertion of a reward or redemption to be meted out after an individual’s death. Neither Elihu nor any other party to the Jobian analysis manifests a belief in an ‘after life’ [העולם הבא] in which transgressors are punished and people of faith are rewarded.6\nElihu’s theological approach avoids the stand taken by Job’s three comrades. He tells us that “against [Job] his anger burned, because [Job] justified himself rather than God. Also against his three friends did [Elihu’s] anger burn, because they found no answer, and yet had condemned [Job]” [32:2].\nElihu challenges Job to dispute the theological point to be made by him. In his own words: “If thou canst, answer me; set thy words in order before me; stand up” [33:4]. He then explains that God himself does not deign to talk to people. He “speaks once, yea twice, yet man perceives it not. In a dream, in vision of the night, when deep sleep falls upon men … then he opens the ears of men…” [33:14-16].7 Arrogantly he tells Job: “If thou hast anything to say answer me … If not harken to me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom” [33:32-33].\nElihu’s outlook is questionable. In other passages of the MT, God addresses individuals directly. His appearance to Moses, in which He gives explicit instruction to the prophet, is but one of them [Ex. 3:3-end]. God’s eloquent initiation address to Jeremiah [Jer. 1:3-end] is another. Further, Elihu demands a reply from Job, although his speeches were written well after the conclusion of the debates and the compilation of the original version of Job. Does this make sense?\nA detailed analysis of Elihu’s speeches does not raise any further point.8 Notably, the Qumran Scroll includes parts of Elihu’s speech. Chapters 32 to 37 are also set out in the LXX, although certain verses thereof are missing. On this basis it is to be concluded that, although Elihu’s speeches are late additions, they were composed at an early stage. As pointed out above, paleontologists have concluded that the Qumran Scroll was written in Herodian script. This means that Elihu’s speeches were part of Job as circulated in the first century BCE. Further, scraps of the Hebrew text were discovered amongst the Dead Sea Scroll.9\nElihu’s viewpoint is in tandem with modern Christian and Jewish theology, which maintain that the ways of God are just and that everything is part of a divine plan. Earlier on Jeremiah advises that God’s principle is “to give everyone according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings” [Jer. 32:19]. In the circumstances, one might enquire whether the bet of God and Satan (described in the prologue) was likewise retributive or preordained.\nOp. cit., pp. 211 et seq., citing available authorities.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nIn 33:8-11, in which he refers to 13:23-24; and in 34:5-9 referring to 27:3; and in 35:3 referring to 7:20.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n32:12; 33:1; 34:5; 36:16 and 37:13-14.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nAnd see S.

To save mother the trouble of preparing a hasty lunch, I got myself a Pitah Falafel – a local delicacy which had lined the pockets of many a surgeon specialising in abdominal ulcer operations – and walked home. In those golden days of youth, a half hour’s walk appeared a trifle.\nAs I entered, mother looked up from her needle work. As soon I sat down and took off my jacket, she started to question me about the case. She was taken aback when I told her of Morag’s intervention.\n“Was this appropriate?” she wanted to know.\n“Hard to say. Fischer irked him. But I suspect there was more to it than that.”\n“How did Fischer irk Morag?”\n“Fischer was plain uncivil to me when I started my very mild cross. Morag is known as a master of his court. He intervened when Fischer stepped out of line. Still, I think there was some other factor. Fischer kept looking over my shoulder when he talked to me. I suspect Morag was given the same treatment. And he did not appreciate it.”\n“I think I understand,” conceded mother.\nMother was not surprised when I mentioned Rachel’s outburst. She knew Rachel disliked Ruth and her entire milieu. All in all, Rachel was a self-made woman. She had no time for the pampered carriers of mid-European culture. She looked down on them.\n“Surely, Mamma, she did not ‘look down on me’?”\n“She didn’t. I know that. But you Peter’le had never been a cultural snob. Further, you admired Rachel for months before she took you on. I remember how you kept raving about her. On the surface, you admired her courtroom manner. But right from the start there was more to it than that.”\n“I know. Still, Mamma, I am out of the woods now. As you know, I am a reasonable man prepared to concede defeat.”\n“Thank goodness. Still, Peter’le, Rachel continues to have a soft spot for you. This, in part, explains her outburst. I’m pretty sure of it. You see, women tend to remember. And Rachel is human. She took you on at the right time and decided, on her own, when to call it a day.”\n“Was I just an ‘episode’ in her life?”\n“Perhaps. And, of course, it is over. But all in all, neither of you has grounds to regret the past.”\nMother was pleased to gather that Ruth and Boaz would be working out the details of an ex gratia settlement. When I told her about my dinner appointment with Rachel, she urged me to talk as little as possible about the case.\n“You better make it clear to Rachel that your affair did not leave a bitter taste in your mouth. That’s what she wants to hear.”\nI got back to our courtroom at about 2.15 pm. One of Ruth’s assistants handed me a note advising that Rotem has agreed to make an ex gratia payment of an amount slightly above Rachel’s original offer. A few minutes later, Boaz stepped in accompanied by Fischer. Stepping over to my side of the courtroom, he confirmed the details of the arrangement.\n“How did you feel about Morag’s intervention, Eli?”\n“Coming from him it was fine. I don’t think another judge would have stepped in like that. Thank goodness, he did not persist.”\n“I was getting ready to object when he handed poor Fischer back to you.”\n“What on earth possessed him? Morag has a short fuse. Still, he knows how to control himself.”\n“Fischer was unnecessarily rude to you. But I think there is a background. Before Morag’s wife ran away, she had a number of affairs. I believe one was with Fischer.’\n“Did Morag know?”\n“Rumour has it that he did. Still, Fischer appeared as an expert witness in a few cases tried by Morag recently. Morag showed no irritation on these occasions. In any event, the present dispute has been settled. Accordingly, all is well.”\n“But why did Fischer play the fool? He is a shrewd fellow. What’s the matter with him?”\n“I found out three days ago. I’d like to tell you over dinner.”\n“Rachel has asked me out for tonight. How about lunch tomorrow?”\n“I’ve got to catch the bus to Haifa before 3.00pm.”\n“Let’s then meet in our old eatery at 11.45am.”\nAs soon as Morag returned to court, Boaz advised him of the settlement. Morag made it clear he was pleased. He assumed that the matter of costs had been attended to and that there was no need for him to write a full judgment.\n“Procedurally, there is no need, Your Honour. But I am convinced my Learned Friend, other members of the profession and, of course, I, would love to read Your Honour’s analysis of the issue.”\n“I couldn’t agree more,” responded Boaz.\n“Very well then. It will be ready in about two weeks.”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/scaffolding/part-9/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI had no wish to remain in the empty courtroom for about three hours or to join the queue of advocates at the cafeteria. To save mother the trouble of preparing a hasty lunch, I got myself a Pitah Falafel – a local delicacy which had lined the pockets of many a surgeon specialising in abdominal ulcer operations – and walked home. In those golden days of youth, a half hour’s walk appeared a trifle.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Part 9: Reaching a Settlement"},{"content":"Usually the preparation of an appeal was cumbersome. You had to capitalise on whatever supported your client’s case. If he was the appellant, your task was to drive holes in the judgment given against him. If he was the respondent, you had to find every argument supporting the trial judge’s conclusions.\nSimha’s case was different. Our clients had no objection to a substantial increase in the damages awarded to Simha. Ehood Morag, who had entered judgment for the maximum amount he could, made it clear he thought the compensation ought to be higher. The only other point of contention was the perturbing defence of contributory negligence. Rotem was not comfortable with it. As a matter of policy, neither they nor Solbon would have opposed a reform of the applicable English doctrines.\nThe only difficult point concerned the issue of representation. By convention, lawyers appeared before the Court of Appeal – which constituted a division of the Supreme Court in Jerusalem – only after five years of practical experience in the regional courts. In consequence, I was unqualified to take the matter ‘up’. Jacob Keren, though, was not keen to take charge of the file or to transfer it to Rachel. Such a step would increase the costs but, in effect, would not be of any assistance to the clients.\n“Well, Eli, so you will have to handle the appeal yourself!”\n“But how? They’ll refuse to listen to me! And President Magor can be a terror when a young lawyer appears before him!”\n“As regards the latter: you must learn to take the rough with the smooth. On the first point: don’t worry. We’ll get a ‘status dispensation’. As long as Boaz does not object, it’ll be a clean run.”\nOn the day before the appeal – some eight months after the trial – I took the train up to Jerusalem. Ruth Schwartz, Rotem’s in-house counsel, came up to oversee developments.\nThe panel before whom Boaz and I were to appear comprised President Magor – originally a London barrister – another permanent member of the Supreme Court, Justice Baram, who was universally admired for his learning but known to take his leads on controversial issues from the President, and Justice Baruch Shoham from Tel Aviv. Shoham, who unlike most Israeli judges, was a mid-European Jew with German qualifications, was considered a common sense judge. His somewhat deficient comprehension of the finer points of English law was compensated by his craving for justice and fair play. The esteem felt for him by the Bar in Tel Aviv dictated that – in accordance with the practice of those days – he be invited from time to time to sit on the Court of the Appeal.\nDespite certain tensions between Magor and Shoham, we had a fair minded and competent panel. The judge to watch was Baram. His faultless knowledge of precedents could give rise to unexpected points in respect of the contributory negligence doctrine. On such technical issues, both Magor and Shoham might take their cue from him. In the event, though, the issue was solved without argument. When I arrived in court, Ruth Schwartz showed me a telegram, just received from her office, advising that Solbon had waived the defence. They had no objection to our arguing the point, with a view to its determination for future cases. Still, regardless of the decision, the damages awarded to Simha were not to be ‘apportioned’.\nBoaz displayed no surprise. He confided that, after a discreet conversation with Amnon Degan, he anticipated such a move. He knew also that Simha’s gang, accompanied by other Solbon employees, had made representations on this point to the local Management Committee.\n“I only hope Magor won’t pounce on me for advising them at such a late stage. He is not the most tolerant man in the world,” I let my apprehension show.\n“Tell them you had just received the instructions. If necessary, I’ll come in with a rear-guard action. But, in any event, we can still argue it for the sake of the textbooks. Baram would love a chance to analyse and pontificate: they’ll let him carry the day on that! Nice to give the poor chap a chance to play first fiddle.”\nAs it happened, events rendered the move unnecessary. As soon as the possibility of arguing the point for future reference was raised, Baram had a whispered conference with the two other judges. When they finished, Magor advised us that the Law Reform Commission had just appointment a Committee, charged with the task of reviewing our law of torts. Justice Baram was to be Chairman. In the circumstances, the proper course to be taken by counsel would be to submit their views on this specific issue (or any others) to the Committee. The Court ought to keep out.\n“The only issue is the measure of damages,” pronounced the President. “Mr. Tamir.”\n“Your Honours,” Boaz spoke evenly but I sensed he was embarrassed. “On this issue, the plaintiff, Mr. Balani, wishes to address Your Honours in person.”\n“But Mr. Tamir,” Magor let his surprise show. “You are the plaintiff’s representative. Unless discharged, you are the proper person to address the Court. And I am confident my Brothers – just like myself – would not wish to be deprived of your eloquence!”\n“The plaintiff, though, feels that the interest of justice would be better served if, on this issue, he presented his case himself.”\n“But we do have to follow the rules of procedure,” Magor was both firm and stern.\n“But the interest of justice, Mr. President, is paramount,” Baruch Shoham spoke just as decisively but without a slant. “I do think they should prevail over formal practice.”\n“But should we hear two addresses by one party: I mean by the plaintiff and by his counsel?” asked Magor.\n“I agree this would be unacceptable,” said Shoham. “If the plaintiff addressed us in person, his counsel should not be allowed to address us on the issue involved. That, at least, is the mid-European practice! Still, such an issue of practice must rest with the President.”\nMagor was reflecting, when Justice Baram passed to him a tightly written note. For a second, Magor looked surprised. Then, raising his head, he delivered his ruling: “Our Brother Baram, with his exceptional knowledge of precedents, tells me that, even in English law, some authorities sanction the procedure just advocated by Brother Shoham. Accordingly, your application to address the Court is granted, Mr. Balani. But your counsel, Mr. Tamir, will not argue this matter further before us. Well, I shall call a 15 minutes recess so the courtroom can be rearranged. And, Mr. Tamir, will you kindly explain to Mr. Balani the importance of speaking slowly and clearly so as to enable our stenographer to follow.”\nWe all bowed as the Court rose. Shoham, who knew Boaz and me well, smiled at us. The President and Baram engaged in a short conversation on their way out. Baram bestowed on Simha a sympathetic glance.\nSimha’s speech was neither polished nor literary. Yet, it was a masterpiece. Notwithstanding the faulty grammar and unsophisticated vocabulary, it was eloquent and left an impact. Translating it into English is a difficult task. Still, I can give its gist and, in the process, seek to recreate the atmosphere.\nSimha started by describing the life he had led before the accident. An out of doors man, he had been proud of his agility and energy. Unlike other men of his age, who grabbed the opportunity to withdraw to a desk job, he craved to remain in the fresh air. Knowing he was not the leader type, he gave up the foreman’s job and opted to remain a member of the gang. This way he felt happy and fulfilled.\nHis lust for fresh air had also been a key factor in his private life. He remembered with pride the many football matches to which he had taken Shimon and the matches he used to have with him and his schoolmates. When he felt he was no longer able to run as fast as them, he turned himself into a trainer. Their victory of a local trophy had filled him with pride: his perseverance, patience and skill as instructor had paved their way to victory.\nSimha’s speech did not display any bitterness or any antagonism towards his employers. Solbon were good ‘masters’ and had their employees’ interests at heart. He conceded that if the instructions in the manual had been observed when the truck had been loaded, and if his gang had been more careful when unloading, he would still be the same old Simha. Human error, though, could never be ruled out: from time to time it was bound to take place. That the consequences had turned out to be that drastic was a stroke of bad luck.\n“But Mr. Balani,” interjected the President, “you stepped into the danger zone voluntarily. The point is not pressed on us by the defendants: so, it is academic. Still, I should like to understand.”\n“Your Honour,” Simha spoke spontaneously; “I didn’t think. It’s just that I saw Yossi – my future son in law – and that was that. And I also saw, at the same minute, my daughter’s face.”\n“Do you think you would have rushed in if Yossi weren’t there?” asked Baram.\n“I honestly don’t know, Your Honour. I acted …”\n“… instinctively,” the President interjected as Simha struggled for the word.\n“Thank you Your Honour,” Simha spoke warmly.\nResuming his address, Simha pointed out that the injuries sustained by him, which would be intolerable in the case of any man, were particularly hard on him. A scholar might still pursue his interest, such as a reading habit. A musician, though unable to play his instrument, would still enjoy listening to records; and an artist may still draw or paint, even if not at full speed. He, in contrast, lost not only his ability to make a livelihood but also his comforts of life. Being unable to write and having but a limited reading knowledge, his only option would be to turn to weaving or to taking up a receptionist’s or other light office job. He was left without any hobby or interest to pursue.\n“But, surely,” said Shoham, “you are not giving up. People must always make the best of what is left to them!”\n“I know, Your Honour,” agreed Simha. “I am told that an Austrian poet kept writing even after he was confined to sickbed; one of Shimon’s friends told me. But in my case: the options are very limited.”\n“I know,” said Shoham.\n“So, my loss is great, Your Honours; very great,” sighed Simha.\n“Nobody would question this,” agreed the President, failing to meet Simha’s glance. Simha concluded his speech with a plea for understanding. None of the Judges had any questions to raise. A note from Ruth Schwartz – Rotem’s in-house lawyer – instructed me not to reply. Glancing over my shoulder, I saw that Amnon Degan was sitting beside her. He must have arrived shortly after Simha started his address. Emphasising the Court’s regrets of being deprived of the eloquence of both Boaz and myself, the President advised that judgment would be delivered after the lunch break.\nAs soon as the Justices had retired, I walked across the courtroom and congratulated Simha. “You think I spoke well, Mr. Eli?”\n“You did, Simha, you did indeed,” I assured him.\n“You come and visit me when we buy a big nice house from the profits Shimon makes in his business!”\n“I’ll be delighted to come, Simha. And I’m sure you’ll get a big award. I watched their faces.”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/simha-glory/part-9/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eUsually the preparation of an appeal was cumbersome.

This time Dahlia and her mother were also present. Both looked awkward and out of place. To my relief, Franz Wolf’s arrival eased the atmosphere. Dropping into a vacant chair beside Dahlia he talked to her in a quiet and measured voice. Taking our cue from him, the rest of us did our best to put mother and daughter at their ease. In due course, the clouds left Dahlia’s face. Rivka’s expression, too, brightened.\n“Well, Ben Zion, so what do you have to tell us?” asked Rachel.\n“We have firmed our decision to treat the policy as if it had not lapsed,” advised Ben Zion. “As I said last time, the non-payment of premium terminates the contract between the insurance company and the assured. But, in view of our lengthy relationship with Wollor, we have decided to treat the policy as being in force.”\n“I consider this an appropriate and commendable stand,” interceded Jacob Keren.\n“I am gratified,” said Ben Zion. “But, of course, this is not an end of the matter. We have to settle the amount to be paid by us.”\n“Do you find the figures excessive?” I asked with alarm.\n“Not in themselves: the assessment is sound. Naturally, the amount claimed for Dahlia’s loss of enjoyment of life is high. But then the accident is serious.”\n“What then is disputed?” asked Rachel.\n“The amount claimed in respect of loss of future earnings. As you know, Dahlia was a temporary employee …”\nFranz Wolf interceded: “But she was really good. We raised her salary after her first three weeks with us!”\nA round of heavy bargaining resulted, with Rachel taking the lead. On several occasions, she pushed Ben Zion into a corner and Ruth Schwartz had to step in to extricate him. In the end, Hannah brought the matter to its conclusion by pointing out that, in the ultimate, Rotem wanted to ensure Dahlia got adequate and fair compensation. Jacob Keren nodded.\n“I wish this was the end of it,” said Ben Zion. “But there is one further matter, which we raised last time. It concerns the effect of the excess clause. And there is also the apportionment issue. As we all know, the main switch was on when Dahlia cleaned the guillotine.”\n“But my Dahlia did what she was told,” Rivka exclaimed with agitation.\n“We know that,” Ben Zion hurried, hoping to allay her fears. “But the point is relevant because the policy holder is Wollor. We raise it in respect of their claim under the policy.”\nTo my relief, Rivka did not reply. In the ensuing bargaining session, Boaz – Wollor’s representative – took over. He started with an attempt to construe the clauses in the spirit of the main objective of the policy, which was to enable Wollor to settle claims brought by employees. He then pointed out that any apportionment of the amount would have a direct bearing on the compensation received by Dahlia. In the circumstances, we should sidestep any technicalities regardless of their legal soundness.\nRachel agreed and, to my surprise, Jacob Keren voiced his reservations about any attempt to interpret the clauses of the policy in a manner that might defeat an employee’s justified claim. On further consideration, though, I realised that Jacob Keren’s words were true to his political manifesto. He had started his career in the courts as the advocate of victims of industrial accidents. Despite his rise in the legal world, he had retained his ideals. Like my reform orientated friend, Boaz, Keren had the facility of seeing the wider – sociological – effects of undesirable legal niceties. I knew that in his heart of hearts Jacob Keren realised that the law was a tool used by a powerful party against those weaker than him. Whenever possible he liked to see that justice be done.\nStill, his intervention did not put an end to the haggling. Notwithstanding the patent sympathy of the Rotem lawyers, I had the feeling one further round of negotiations was becoming inevitable. Jacob Keren must have been of the same view. He was about to suggest that the meeting be stood over, when Franz Wolf saved the day.\n“I understand the points you are making. But – in terms of real money – what is the gap between what Dahlia needs and what Rotem offers to pay?”\n“About IL80,000.00,” explained Ben Zion Vered, sounding unhappy and embarrassed. “I wish we didn’t have to bargain like that, but this is, really, a question of principle.”\n“I understand,” answered Franz Wolf. “I too had a legal training. But perhaps I can help. You see, I have just sold our villa in Herzlia. I bought it before the prices skyrocketed. Well, I need some of the money to pay for a flat I bought in Hamburg. But there is a surplus of IL55,000. It can be used to settle part of Dahlia’s claim.”\nEveryone present was startled. In response to Ben Zion’s quizzical look, Boaz observed: “I told Mr. Wolf he was not under a duty to do this. But he has made up his mind.”\n“But Uncle Franz,” chimed in Dahlia, “can you really afford this? Don’t you need the money to help you settle in Hamburg? I don’t want you to be too tight.” Her words reflected real concern for his well being. It was evident she had genuine affection for him.\n“You must get the best medical treatment available. And, yes, Young Lady: I have enough and am going to be paid well in Hamburg. So don’t you worry. Just write to me as soon as you can tell me the operation has been a success.”\n“You’ll get the first letter when I can write again,” she promised. Rivka – I sensed – wanted to add something but was unable to find the words. The grateful look she bestowed on her daughter’s former employer did, in any event, convey her message.\nJacob Keren felt the need to step in. “This brings us much closer. But we are still IL25,000 short. Well?”\n“Just give us about 15 minutes,” said Ruth Schwartz. “I’ll need to make a telephone call. Hopefully, we can settle after it.”\n“You don’t think it would be better to have another meeting?” asked Keren.\n“I don’t think we need it. What do you think Hannah?”\n“Not when they have been apprised of the proceedings,” agreed Hannah.\nRuth Schwartz used the telephone in my office. When she returned – looking much relieved – she confirmed that Rotem would cover the deficiency. Franz Wolf’s idea about a possible intervention of the re-insurers had borne fruit. It turned out that Rotem’s re-insurers were also the re-insurers of the manufacturers’ insurance company. So, in the ultimate, the major portion of the loss was to be settled by them. The manufacturers, though, would lose their no-claims bonus.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ravages-of-a-guillotine/part-9/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eOur next meeting took place two weeks later, on a Friday afternoon.

Ignoring Boaz’s covetous glance in the direction of David Mizrachi’s Eatery, I steered a course to the old fashioned restaurant which served home cooked Jewish dishes. Boaz sighed as he perused the bill of fares but cheered up when the salt beef, boiled chicken, mashed potatoes and a mixed salad were placed in front of us.\n“Today it’s on me, Eli” he said.\nFor a while both of us concentrated on the excellent food. Initially, the peace and quiet surrounding us was comforting but, eventually, I found the silence depressing.\n“Boaz: what’s the matter. It’s not like you to sit here and brood! Have I offended you somehow?”\n“Of course not, Eli. Don’t be silly. The little games we play when we practise law are contests of skill. But there are certain matters on my mind.”\n“I hope nothing is wrong \u0026hellip;” I started and stopped dead in my tracks, apprehensive of asking a tactless question.\n“No, Eli, nothing’s wrong at home,” Boaz hurried to assure me. “Now that things are back to normal, Miri is again her good happy self. And – let me tell you – a few days ago Ruthi got a distinction in school for her essay!”\n“So maybe one day she’ll outshine Dad!” I grinned.\n“Let’s hope she picks on something better than our bloody profession,” answered Boaz, then hastily covered his mouth with his palm.\n“So, something’s wrong at work. Care to tell me?”\nFor a moment Boaz hesitated. “You see, Eli, some two weeks ago, just before I was back at work, they had their quarterly partners’ meeting. Well, they constituted me a salaried partner!”\n“Congratulations. That’s excellent news. So what on earth is wrong?”\n“They elected Leah Sapir and that fellow Dror Ergass full equity partners! I keep telling myself both have been with the firm longer than me. But I still can’t understand why they were jumped from associates to full partners in one go!”\n“It is unfair. Both are average. Dror is also bone lazy! And Leah is useless; in her two years with Keren, she was nicknamed ‘the mother of all lost cases’!”\n“Well, neither of them has changed for the better over the years.” Boaz, broke our eye contact and fixed his dejected glance on the plate in front of him. I, in turn, looked at him with understanding.\nBoaz’ chagrin and my sympathy might have puzzled an outsider. Indeed, to anybody except a fellow lawyer, Boaz’ new designation would have sounded grand. In reality, though, a ‘salaried partner’ was nothing but a well paid associate. He had no say in the running of the firm, was not entitled to a share in its profits and, unlike an ‘equity partner’, remained an employee. In a ‘Sole Proprietorship’, such as ‘J. Keren \u0026amp; Associates’, such an appointee was known as a ‘Senior Associate’. His pay was higher than a mere associate’s. But the ‘Sole Proprietor’ remained the one and only boss!\n“Surely, Boaz, you’ll be made an equity partner next year! Still, I don’t understand how Israel Silver could do this to you!”\n“He didn’t, Eli. You must remember that, unlike Jacob Keren, Silver is just the Senior or Managing Partner. The younger partners have the power to outvote him. This time they did! They argued it would be safer to consider my case after I’d recovered. Silver had to give way but wrung out the Salaried Partnership and an undertaking that I would be reviewed again next year!”\n“Well, at least he fought for you. And I hope he got you a good salary.”\n“He did, rather. I’ll get as much as Dror and Leah. And the firm will also pay me a percentage of my billings. If I pull my weight my ‘take home package’ will be fine. But there’ll still be the thorn in the flesh: I can’t bear to think these two have been advanced before me.”\n“They’ve been with the firm much longer than you. It’s not as if they had stolen a march. And perhaps it was their last chance.”\n“That what I keep telling myself. But Dror and Leah trot home by 5.00 p.m. and I stay behind till 9.00 or even 10.30 p.m. I’ve worked my guts out for the firm: and just because I’ve crossed swords with some of these bastards, they do a dirty on me when I’m ill in bed!”\n“You mustn’t let this get you down. If it does, they’ll have the last laugh!”\n“I know. Thanks, Eli.”\nSoon the waitress cleared the table and brought us two cups of steaming, strongly brewed and aromatic coffee. Seeing that Boaz remained lost in his thoughts, I prompted: “Is there anything else you wanted to tell me?”\n“As a matter of fact, there is. When this Omri Tal case is over, I want to have a chat with you. If there is any unexpected development at work, please take it easy. I have a plan you might find interesting!”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/the-luck-of-valentino/part-9/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLeaving  our  briefcases  in the “robing room”, Boaz  and  I walked  to Nahalat  Benjamin Street.

Usually, I packed my suitcase with joy for the flight to London and with a glum face for the return trip back to my barren home.\nI could fill a whole ‘bundle’ with anecdotes from my visits to London. Despite his advanced age, Peppi had retained his zest for life and his keen intellect; and he was full of fun. Lucy too was an excellent companion. Occasionally, when Peppi was reluctant to go out in the evening, the two of us went to the West End on our own. After the show, we would have a snack or a drink in one of the numerous bars where, often, I listened with admiration to Lucy’s witty critique of the performance.\nThen, one bright day, a crucial event took place when I was all alone in the shop. I was enjoying a cup of coffee in the small kitchenette, hoping to clear my head from the drowsiness occasioned by the sumptuous lunch in Chelsea and the three glasses of Moselle I had downed with it. Unexpectedly, the electronic bell chimed. The door opened slowly and through it came a tall man, wearing a dark, old fashioned and loosely fitting suit and a navy-blue raincoat.\n“Is Miss Stölzl available?”\n“I’m afraid she has stepped out for a while,” I answered, startled by his German accent.\n“How long will she be?”\n“About half an hour, or perhaps longer. Would you like to wait, or can I be of help?”\n“I have some pieces for sale. I always deal with Miss Lucy. So, I’d better wait.”\n“Can I perhaps offer you a cup of coffee or a soft drink?”\n“A coffee would be nice. But tell me please: aren’t you from Vienna?”\n“You have an acute ear. Would you prefer to speak German?” I asked.\n“It makes no difference to me – but, yes, very well then.”\nWe sat down, clasping the steaming mugs. Having refused sugar and milk, the caller sipped his coffee appreciatively. He seemed unperturbed by the silence whilst I – feeling the duty to act as host – searched for words. At the same time, I had a good look at him. For no apparent reason, a twinge of fear shot down my spine.\n“Do you come to this shop often?” I assumed the courage to ask.\n“Once or twice a year – when I decide to sell some of my pieces. But I’ve not seen you here before.”\n“I’m just a friend of the family. I visit them when I come over to London.”\n“So that’s why we have not met before! And, as a matter of interest, do you collect porcelain, Herr \u0026hellip;?”\n“Berger, Peter Berger. And yes, I do.”\n“I have a large collection,” he told me. “This is why I sell some of my pieces. I hate cluttering. Well, would you like to see what I’ve got with me today?”\nWithout waiting for a reply, he took a parcel out of his shabby briefcase. I viewed the figurines with approval. They were of the type to be found in Peppi’s showcase and in my own collection.\n“This hunting group is splendid!” I said, letting my fingers run gently over the pack of hounds keeping a lion at bay. “Kändler at his best. I’ll see if Lucy agrees to sell it to me. You would have no objection, Herr \u0026hellip;”\n“Duval, Friedrich Duval,” he told me, and, to my surprise, his eyes started to dance merrily. “They call me Mr X in this shop. But you might as well call me by my name. And, of course, after we have clinched a bargain, Miss Lucy is free to sell her pieces to whomsoever she wants.”\n“She might think it fit for Peppi’s cabinet.”\n“True. Obviously, you’ll have to persuade her.”\n“I’ll certainly try. But tell me, please, from where do you hail, Monsieur Duval?”\n“From Göttingen, Herr Berger. I used to teach Theology and Philosophy. But I retired years ago.”\n“I thought ‘Duval’ was a French name.”\n“It is. But then, Europe is a hotchpotch. And, of course, Duval is derived from a longer name.”\nHe paused for a moment. Then, without any change in his mannerism, he said: “Please, have a look at this piece – it is not for sale. But I should value your opinion.”\nFor the next few minutes the shop, the desk with the coffee mugs and Herr Duval himself ceased to exist. My eyes were glued to the aging yet unbeaten Harlequin-Boulevardier. I was fascinated by his Mephistophelian airs, captivated by his proud posture and by the extravagant costume he wore for the carnival. A black mask concealed the figurine’s face.\nLost in a fantasy, I pictured the Boulevardier strolling down the Champs Elysée’s, looking over other gallants and allowing his eye to rove over the dresses of the attractive women walking in the opposite direction. His face, though, remained an enigma. Then, as if by magic, the mask lifted itself and revealed the very face of my caller, Herr Friedrich Duval, alias Mr X.\n“Well, what do you think of it, Herr Berger?”\n“Need I tell you?”\n“Speaking as a fellow connoisseur, I should like to have your views.”\n“Needless to say, it is brilliant!”\n“I am gratified by your assessment. But what captivated you?”\n“The Boulevardier’s subtle irony! Your Boulevardier finds life ironic. He’ll take what he gets (provided he wants it) and won’t flinch when he loses out.”\n“What did you think of his face?”\n“It’s hidden behind the mask. Still, it appeared to uplift itself for a moment. And the face behind the mask looked strangely like yours! I must have had a hallucination!”\n“Why couldn’t the artist have modelled me?”\n“This piece is over 200 years old!”\n“You base your conclusion on general experience?”\n“Well, yes. I’d rather describe it as ‘universal experience’.”\n“Let’s not quibble over words. Why not start with a different premise?”\n“Such as?”\n“That ‘general experience’ cannot refute what you see with your own eyes!”\n“But can I deny a universal truth in reliance on a single peep, a mere impression?”\n“But do you have to accept common wisdom, or experience, as absolute truth?”\n“I see what you mean. All the same, a great deal of evidence would be required to convince me that a man can live 200 or 250 years. I find it difficult to shed my belief in the ‘universal truth’ respecting man’s life span.”\n“More difficult than others have found it to rid themselves of their own gospel truths?”\nThere was a long pause, and then I responded. “I think I get your point, Herr Duval. You are telling me that my application of reason is predetermined by the premises I accept as my foundation?”\n“Precisely, Herr Berger. Except that I prefer to call them ‘axioms’ rather than ‘premises’.”\n“Are my axioms then too narrow?”\n“They are: if they require you to reject all metaphysical experiences without analysis.”\n“Come to think of it, certain religious dogmas were ‘real’ to the medieval mind,” I mused.\n“They were. But to you such dogmas are irrational.”\n“They are. But – if I understand you correctly – so is my a priori rejection of them.”\n“Quite so,” he said gently and, once again, his eyes danced merrily.\n“You have certainly given me food for thought, Herr Duval,” I said.\n“I am gratified.”\nHe was about to add something when the doorbell rang and Lucy stepped through the door. The warm smile on her face melted when she spotted Herr Duval. Gone was the self-assured, forthright lady of the house. We were, instead, facing an apprehensive Lucy looking ill at ease.\n“Have you been waiting long, sir?”\n“Not at all,” replied Herr Duval. “Professor Berger and I had a most interesting and enlightening conversation about porcelain and related topics.”\n“Herr Duval is an expert,” I added. Lucy’s expression conveyed her surprise that our caller had seen fit to introduce himself to me.\n“As before, I have come to your fine shop to see if you might be interested in some of my pieces.”\n“We always are. But I wish you would let me pay you a better price.”\n“I have no use for extra money,” he assured her. “And I forgot to mention: the Boulevardier is not for sale.”\n“How much can I pay you for the rest?” she asked, still apprehensive.\n“The usual two thousand pounds, if you please.”\n“But there are eight pieces here altogether. More than you ever brought before!”\n“Consider it a windfall,” he said benignly. “You know I never haggle. But tell me, please, what do you think of my masked Boulevardier?”\nLucy had already cast several surreptitious glances at the splendid figurine. Facing our caller with mounting unease, she said candidly: “I’m sure it’s an excellent piece; but I don’t like it. It’s uncanny.”\n“In what manner?” he wanted to know.\n“He is mocking me from behind his mask.”\n“Well, well,” he said, unoffended. “So, Herr Berger, our assessment of the piece is not universally accepted. I suspect it is a matter of orientation: like most rationalists we are drawn to the metaphysical!”\n“Oh, I know it is a fine piece,” said Lucy contritely. “But you did ask for my personal view.”\n“So I did; and the truth is always acceptable.” He paused for a moment and added in haste: “But it is getting late. I’d better be on my way.”\nLucy disappeared into the office and returned with a sheaf of notes. Duval shoved them into his wallet without counting, offered his hand to both of us and stepped toward the door.\n“You forgot your Boulevardier, Herr Duval!” I exclaimed.\n“Please take good care of him. I have looked after him since he came out of the kiln,” he replied.\n“But you mustn’t part with him,” I said, distressed.\n“I’ll come back for him when he is needed,” he said with a warm smile and walked out.\nI stood dumbfounded, then rushed after him. But there was no trace of the tall, dark clad figure. Herr Professor Dr Friedrich Duval had vanished into thin air.\n“He gives me the creeps,” shuddered Lucy as she placed her new figurines in one of the display cabinets and proceeded to pack the Boulevardier for me.\n“I think he likes you,” I said, surprised by the edgy tone of my voice.\n“I know. I feel sort of guilty for reacting to him like this. Still, I can’t help it. But you got on with him famously!”\n“He is brilliant,” I concluded. “But I know what you mean. It’s as if he can read your thoughts.”\n“Precisely,” said Lucy. “And you, Cousin Peter, couldn’t take your eyes off that figurine!”\nWe tried to relax over a coffee, and then Lucy went upstairs to take a cup to Peppi. When she came down, she looked puzzled.\n“Papa tells me you want the hunting group. Why didn’t you tell me? I could have packed your two pieces in one box.”\n“I completely forgot,” I prevaricated.\n“A sign of aging, Cousin Peter! Well, I think Papa wants to have a chat with you. Why don’t you run upstairs while I wrap your second treasure.”\nPeppi was rubbing his eyes as people do when they have just roused themselves from sleep. “How did you know about the hunting group?” I asked straight away. “You couldn’t have overheard my conversation with that fellow Duval.”\n“I watched the two of you and heard every single word!”\n“How? Weren’t you up here?”\n“I was. But I sort of saw it all as if in a dream – like then, in the Munich station.”\n“Is he who I think he is?”\n“Of course he is,” said Peppi. “But then, you don’t believe in his existence.”\n“I’ll certainly have to think it over carefully. What I can’t understand is why he doesn’t communicate directly with you.”\n“Perhaps he fears the pull would be too great. Or, maybe, he prefers just to talk to me.” As he sat up, the light fell on his face. He looked drained and I was alarmed by his pallor. “You alright, Peppi?” I asked anxiously.\n“Just a bit tired – like that day in Munich. Peter’le, do you mind opening that safe behind the painting? The combination is Abracadabra. I need a drink from the bottle I keep in it.”\nPeppi took a few swigs. He waited for a few moments, smacked his lips and took another hearty draught. To my relief, the blood returned to his face and his weary expression gave way to his usual smile. Soon his eyes were illuminated by a knowing, warm twinkle.\n“What a potent drink!” I observed.\n“It is! It surpasses even Slivovitz.”\n“Can I have a sip?”\n“Let’s see.” Peppi handed me the bottle. To my surprise, the cork refused to budge when I pulled at it. Grinning slyly, Peppi handed me a corkscrew; but the screw turned without penetrating the cork.\n“I think you are not meant to partake,” smiled Peppi.\n“Have I offended him?”\n“I shouldn’t think so. He might communicate with you in a different manner.”\n“Could I at least smell it?”\nTo my surprise, the stubborn cork popped out and a sweet, alluring scent filled my nostrils. “Thanks,” I said, bewildered. As the cork slipped back into its place, a voice in my mind replied in Friedrich Duval’s German accent: “Don’t mention it!”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-devil-in-munich/chapter-9/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eMy friendship with Peppi and Lucy filled a gap in my life as well as in theirs.

We Meet My neatly tailored three piece grey suit, white shirt and fashionable tie did little to ease the pounding of my heart as I followed the concierge through the imposing dining room of the Zermattschein. Would I recognise Pilkin as soon as I spotted our table? Had his appearance changed as much as mine? For all I knew, he could by now have become the heart and soul of parties given in his honour by a group of jolly grandchildren!\nFor just a moment I was overcome by dismay when my guide steered a course in the direction of a table occupied by the American fund manager, whose arrival in the hotel I had witnessed on the previous day. Had Pilkin turned into yet another money minded financier? Then, to my relief, I was navigated in the direction of a private dining room, camouflaged by a curtain. Holding my hand out, I stepped into the alcove and, instantly, came to a halt. With the world spinning around me, and my mouth wide agape, I stared at the vast bulk of the Hassid, Rabbi Zohar. He was, again, decked in his black caftan but the wide outmoded hat – a 17th century relic – had made way to a fashionable Yarmolka. The walking stick, with its carved handle, rested against a spare chair.\n“Pilkin?” I stammered when I had recovered sufficiently to venture to speak.\n“Who else?” He replied in the resonant Hebrew of our youth. “Sit down and make yourself comfortable, Bushi. I won’t bite you!”\n“And to think we had virtually run into one another yesterday,” I muttered as I sank into a chair facing his. “You didn’t recognise me – did you? But did you have an inkling?”\n“The thought crossed my mind,” he conceded with a grin. “But Bushi, Bushi! Where did you leave your hair?”\n“Where you, Pilkin, got your cane!” I retorted, rising to the bait.\n“Touché!” he chuckled, his eyes regaining their lustre and his face assuming, despite his heavy beard, pronounced sideburns and severe appearance, the light hearted, even bantering, expression I remembered so well. “So come on, Bushi, let’s celebrate with a nip of Kümmel. I brought an excellent bottle – Rischon’s Special Bin! Well – what d’you say?”\nThe very thought of the piquant Schnapps, sweetened by the heavy crystal sugar coating on the bottle, made my mouth water. In the old days, Pilkin and I had consumed many bottles of the excellent East European liqueur. It pained me to tell him: “Sorry, Pilkin, I can’t take such sweet drinks any longer. How about a glass of Cognac?”\n“Oh, I see. Very well then – will a nip of Rischon’s Deluxe Brandy do? I brought a bottle of that too.”\n“That’ll be great,” I said but, at the same time, looked at him with apprehension. If Pilkin had turned as orthodox as suggested by his attire, he would have to discard the entire bottle if he shared a drop of it with a fellow Jew who did not tithe.\n“Let me pour it out for you then,” he said with a twinkle as he produced the bottle. “We assume – incidentally – that our People tithe when given the chance!”\n“A broad minded surmise. So you ain’t … if you’ll excuse my asking … an … extremist?”\n“Of course not! Fanaticism marks inconfidence! I see no cause for that! And, Bushi, like all lawyers you must accept that the roads to Heaven and Justice are paved with fictions!”\n“The Law thrives on fictions!” I assured him.\n“So let’s accept mine and drink to our reunion!”\n2. Pilkin’s Change of Name The Israeli brandy I used to relish in my youth did not match the XO to which my palate had become accustomed over the years. All the same, the potent drink made me feel at home. Rabbi or secular sage, my friend had remained my Pilkin of old. The gulf created by years of separation receded.\n“So now you are Rabbi Chayim Zohar. No wonder I was unable to get news about you through old contacts on the stage. But – you know – even mutual friends, like Kaktus and Plinius, kept mum about you!”\n“I saw to it,” he sneered. “I wanted my … metamorphosis … to come as a surprise. So I told them to hold their tongues! And they did! But, Bushi, it ain’t ‘Chayim Zohar’. Here, have a look at my personal card!”\n“ ‘Rabbi Loeb Zohar’ ” I read out. “But, Pilkin, why on earth did you drop Chayim? What is better than ‘Life’; and ‘Bright Life’ would have sounded good!”\n“Quite,” nodded Pilkin. “But I got sick and tired of people leering at me when they drained their glasses and yelled Le’Chayim [Hebrew slag for ‘bottoms up].”\n“I didn’t think you were that sensitive.”\n“Come on, Bushi. How would you like to be known as Mr. ‘Bottoms Up’?”\n“You have a point there,” I conceded reluctantly. “But why Loeb? Don’t you think ‘Bright Heart’ … gilds the lily?”\n“But ‘Loeb’ has a second meaning. It’s an abbreviation of …”\n“ … lion.” I broke in and – as the penny dropped – added with a grin: “Lion, the leader of the pack!”\n“Indeed; and, Bushi, I liked the sound of it! And it’s a good label for a New York Rabbi! You see – don’t you?”\n“I do. But – hold on – so you are the Rabbi Loeb Zohar?”\n“It is my name now. Have you come across it before?”\n“I read about you in Life. You were acclaimed a mystic, a spiritual leader and a healer!”\n“They were too kind – or, rather, extravagant!”\n“In what way?”\n“I’m no mystic, Bushi. Mysticism and orthodox Judaism are miles apart!”\n“Quite!” I conceded.\n“And I ain’t a new Moses, Luther or William Penn! So that bit about religious leadership was bullshit!”\n“How about your healing powers?”\n“That’s more complex – occasionally, I can help!”\n“Can you cure blindness or a broken back, Pilkin?”\n“Not if the eyesight is really gone or if the spinal cord is severed. In plain language – I can’t ‘heal’ a physical impairment!”\n“Where, then, can you step in?”\n“If the patient suffers from a neurotic condition or if his disease is exacerbated by psychological complications. For instance, I can’t ‘cure’ a joint deformed by rheumatism. But I can alleviate the patient’s sufferings: I show him how to overcome the panic often associated with the onset of an attack!”\n“You helped me in the old days: when an asthma attack was setting in.”\n“It’s still the same power: I tranquillise the sufferer. That’s all I can do.”\n“A form of hypnosis?”\n“Probably.”\n“So the sufferer’s creed is irrelevant?”\n“But, Bushi, only Jews come to me. And if they don’t believe in my powers I can’t help even them. So it is a matter of faith – in me or in Him! That’s why we call it ‘faith healing’!”\n“Do your … patients … reward you?”\n“All donations go to the Loeb Zohar Foundation. It pays me an honorarium. The bulk is paid over to Jewish charities.”\n“So you distribute some of the wealth amassed by our well-to-do brethren to our Schlemiels and Schliemasels!”\n“Quite so! And I make no excuses for keeping it an in-house charity!”\n“You needn’t. I understand your philosophy: you concern yourself with the problems of the ‘clan’!”\n“Well spoken,” Pilkin beamed at me. “In the old days, we often viewed the world through glasses with different tints. But we also saw each other’s point!”\n“The mark of civilised men,” I muttered. “And Pilkin – is your home in New York or in Tel Aviv? Quite a few of your postcards bore Israeli stamps!”\n“I shuttle between the two cities, Bushi. I have a Schul in Manhattan and another not far from my mother’s old flat in Tel Aviv!”\n“So you still live there when you’re in Tel Aviv?”\n“No, Bushi. We have a flat in Nordau Boulevard, a short walk to the beach. I swim every morning: even in the winter!”\n“So how do you get back from your Schul on the Sabbath? It’s an hour’s walk!”\n“I took it in my stride as long as I was up to it. Then, when my hip started to give trouble, we made arrangements to stay for the weekend with a member of the congregation. But we’ll have to find some permanent solution!”\n“Can’t you drive back home after the service? Remember: risk to body and health overrides the Sabbath!”\n“Too easy, Bushi – far too easy! It’s a sin to play hard and fast with the rules. We’ll probably have to move to a flat nearer the Schul. And I don’t mind too much. Swimming is no longer such fun! And you, Bushi – you are all settled in that Eastern paradise of yours?”\n“Quite. I’m too well entrenched and comfortable in Singapore to fancy another move. And it is my wife’s hometown. Also, I enjoy my work: a consultancy in a major law firm in town plus my teaching job in the University. I won’t be able to get such a deal anywhere else: not at my age!”\n“I see.” For a short while both of us kept reflecting. Then we turned to the menus placed in front of us by the waiter.\n2. A Liberal Rabbi “I didn’t realise they had a Kosher menu here,” I let my surprise show.\n“An orthodox Jewish family from Basle bought this establishment some ten years ago. But you take what you like. I’m told the non-Kosher menu is one of the best in Zermatt.”\n“The Kosher one, too, looks very good. I’ll have a go at it. But I hope you don’t mind if I have a coffee with milk after the meal.”\n“Not at all. I’ll have mine with coconut cream.”\n“How come they have a beef stew on the Kosher menu? I thought Kosher butcheries are outlawed in tolerant Switzerland?” I wanted to know.\n“They get the meat from a Kosher outlet in Israel. But I’d recommend the goose: it’s excellent!”\n“Splendid!”\n“And I’ve brought me with me two bottles of Karmel Hock. You relished it in the old days.”\n“We don’t get it in Singapore. I’d love to taste it again. It was a great wine!”\n“Still is. At least – I think so,” beamed Pilkin.\nAs soon as the waiter departed with our orders, I gave vent to an unease I had felt during the preceding few minutes. “I accept you are a Rabbi, Pilkin. You always had an orthodox streak in you. But how can you, willingly and apparently quite happily, stick to …”\n“ … a set of rules and customs which the rest of the world considers ludicrous?” he finished the sentence for me.\n“Precisely.”\n“Well, let’s ask ourselves: what’s the object of these – h’m – ‘strange rules’ – not only the dietary laws but also others, such as not wearing clothes made of mixed fibres?”\n“The teachers in TA.1 used to say these rules had ‘hygienic’ objects!” I reminded him.\n“And you had a row with old Lipez when you asserted camel meat was O.K.!” grinned Pilkin.\n“He summoned my mother and gave her a lecture on the bad influence of heretical parents!”\n“Well, Bushi, so what is the purpose of all these ‘funny laws’ as you used to call them? You angered many of us when you said they were sheer nonsense and that a ‘smart guy’ like you could not be bothered with them! Surely, that was a perverse reaction.”\n“It was, rather,” I conceded, failing to hide my embarrassment. “And, well, I think I have worked out what’s behind them. But – Pilkin – I don’t want to spoil our reunion. Perhaps I shouldn’t have raised the subject?”\n“Rubbish! Out with it, Bushi. I, too, have mellowed. Nowadays I can take all this in my stride. So let’s have your thoughts.”\n“If you obeyed all these rules to the letter, Pilkin, we could not dine together or, possibly, even socialise. For instance, we couldn’t have a drink together. And if I had a son, you would have to stop your daughter from seeing him, unless, of course, he became orthodox. And any mixing with gentiles would be a no-no!”\n“So?”\n“We are dealing with segregatory laws: meant to keep the community intact. And, I suspect, they can be used to excommunicate non-conformists. Historically, the rules probably originated as different tribal customs each with its own object. For instance, you don’t eat camel meat because the camel is too valuable a pack animal to be slaughtered for food. I’ve no idea what’s wrong with shellfish. A bad fish can give you just as bad a food poisoning as bad oyster. And God alone knows what’s wrong with mixed fibre clothes. But the aggregate effect of all these laws is clear: conserving the community as a group apart from the rest of the world!”\n“I agree,” said Pilkin, whose expression had remained immobile throughout my harangue.\n“So why do you accept them?”\n“But that’s the point, Bushi! I’m all in favour of the policy they serve!”\n“What do you mean?”\n“Well, Bushi – what do you think of the survival of our nation – the Jews?”\n“It is a historical fact, Pilkin!”\n“But do you cherish it!”\n“Not really – to be honest.”\n“And why?”\n“All other people of antiquity have disappeared from the face of the earth long ago. The Hittites had been forgotten for centuries. Babylon and Assyria have long perished. Old Egypt is no more. Even mighty Rome – which ruled the world with an iron fist – is today just a town in Italy. Only we, the Jews, keep going on: we stick to our old ways. We prosper in Diaspora and fail to mingle with the people who let us into their countries. We are living fossils, Pilkin! ‘The little men upon a stair; the little men, who weren’t there; we weren’t there again today; Oh God – please let us get away!’ I think this doggerel sums it all up.”\n“What do you mean?” asked Pilkin, bewildered.\n“If we had gone they way of all flesh as a nation, the world would have had to look for another flogging post! I wish it had to!”\n“But, Bushi, the ‘world’ – as you call it – has massacred at least as many gentiles as Jews. I don’t have to teach you history, do I?”\n“No, you don’t. And it’s true that pogroms are carried out against many minority group. I know all this. But the Jews, Pilkin, stand out as the subject of systematic persecution over the centuries.”\n“But then, Bushi, doesn’t it make you proud to belong to a group that has braved all these storms. Aren’t you proud to be a Jew?”\n“Can’t say I am, Pilkin. Not anymore than I would have been of my ‘race’, had I been a Chinese, an Englishman, an American or a Singaporean. Our national or cultural affiliation is a heritage: not an achievement!”\n“Well, I beg to differ! I am proud of my forefathers, who risked life and limb, and turned their backs on prosperity and safety, to preserve that cultural and national heritage.”\n“With the aid of anti-Semitism and the Yellow Star of David,” I muttered.\n“Perhaps, but conversion was open to them; and they desisted. And so have both of us!”\n“True; and I’ll be damned if I see my reason for remaining Jewish. Plain stubbornness, I venture!”\n“And pride – even if you deny it!”\n“Perhaps; but it would be perverse pride – at least on my part!”\n“But consistency is the tribute of an ox, Bushi,” grinned Pilkin, regaining his relaxed airs. “Still, now it’s clear why you hate our dietary rules whilst I put up with them: I treasure the survival of our nation; you don’t!”\n“In the ultimate, then, both attitudes make sense: they are functional!” I summed up.\n“So they are. But in reality neither of us takes an extreme stand. You are still a moderate radical with idiosyncratic notions: like when you clamoured to convince us that Josephus wasn’t such a bad guy. And I’m still on the liberal wing of orthodox Judaism!”\n3. Tittle Tattle The waiter placed a plate of Gefilte Fish in front of Pilkin, who pretended not to see the unfriendly look I bestowed on the renowned delicacy savoured by East European Jews. He, in turn, glanced with a connoisseur’s appreciation at my smoked salmon with the horse radish.\n“Won’t you have a glass of Alicante with the Gefilte Fish?” I tried to make up for my unmannerly reaction.\n“I’d better not. With my arthritis and a touch of the gout it’s best to be careful!”\n“I’m sorry. Is that why you need the cane?”\n“Yes,” he said without bitterness, adding as an afterthought: “we’re not getting younger, Bushi. We are now the older generation. So we have to reckon with some wear and tear.”\n“I suppose it applies to all our old friends,” I said sadly.\n“What do you think?”\n“I know. But I recall all of them as young men and women, fresh out of TA.1. I find it hard to think they are now a group of oldies!”\n“That’s because you’ve been out of touch for so long.”\n“Well, tell me about them!”\nIt soon dawned on me that Pilkin had kept tabs on all our classmates. He talked about them as we enjoyed our starters and the excellent soups. It grieved me to learn that two of my old schoolmates had passed away after protracted wrangling with cancer, that another had suffered a stroke and that one of the girls – wooed by many boys – had committed suicide after her only son had met with a fatal car accident. To my relief there were, of course, also a number of success stories. One old friend had been constituted the Attorney General of Tel Aviv. The ‘Chief Justice’ of the Josephus Trial had been awarded a Nobel Prize in Science. Another boy had become the Head of an important Faculty in the Hebrew University and others still had made their careers in the business world.\nMany of the girls, too, had done well for themselves. I was particularly intrigued to learn that one had become a famous, albeit left wing, journalist and another the author of a number of well regarded books on Oriental and European Cuisine. Pilkin’s account further revealed that, with but few exceptions, our former classmates enjoyed steady and lasting marriages. Most of them had, by now, become grandparents.\nWhen Pilkin’s discourse came to its end, I observed with a benign sneer: “So our TA.1 graduates have carried the banner to the heights anticipated by our venerated teachers”\n“We have” he agreed, with a kindly smile. “But now, Bushi, I have something special to tell you. Guess about whom!”\n“Leàh?” I asked after a momentary hesitation.\n“Precisely!”\n“How is she? What has become of her?”\n“She married a nice sort of a businessmen and they did well, really well. Then, suddenly, he died. It took her a while to get over his loss. For months, she was very lonely. Then she opened a modern art gallery in Dizengoff Street! It’s going well.”\n“How d’you know all this?”\n“We went out for lunch from time to time and she opened up. I thought it best not to see her in the evenings.”\n“Eh?”\n“Leàh can be rather basic, Bushi; and I’m a Rabbi – remember!”\n“True. Well, so what happened?”\n“Eventually, she met a nice chap – some fifteen years her junior – and they got married. Initially, her two sons by her first husband objected to the new union. So I had a word with them. And, Bushi, she made it again. Young Ronnie dotes on her! Eats out of her hand!”\n“So all is well. She must still be attractive; or she couldn’t have landed such a young fellow!”\n“Have a look,” volunteered Pilkin. “I’ve told her we were having a reunion and so she sends her regards. She asked me to show you this photo!”\nPushing the emptied soup plate aside, I placed the large photo in front of me. What I saw gave me a start. The sagging bust, wrinkled neck, double chin and protruding cheeks bore no resemblance to Leàh of Zermatt.\nSensing the extremity of my reaction, Pilkin chided: “Pull yourself together, Bushi. You’ve always been a hypersensitive guy. But really: do you think – per chance – that you have remained a good looking youngster: a dashing fellow with a cute mustachio – the dream of the girls?”\n“I never was that,” I assured him when I regained my composure. “But, really, Pilkin: Leàh was such a beautiful girl!”\n“Time doesn’t stand still for anybody, Bushi. Did you – my friend – expect to end up a pale faced baldie? Did I ever think I’d need a cane? And, Bushi, Leàh was not beautiful. Buxom: yes; sexy: most men thought so. But her real strength was personality. She could hold her own in any gathering! And she still can. Two years ago she stood for Parliament and – but for a silly outburst against the Mayor of Tel Aviv – would have made it! And think about it: how many women in her age group can captivate a young fellow like Ronnie?”\n“I suppose you are right. But I wish you had prepared me. I hope you haven’t brought with you photos of our other old flames.”\n“I haven’t. So cheer up!”\n“Have I aged as much as her?” I asked uneasily.\n“Well, yes; but you look distinguished. So let’s not worry about this. And, perhaps, Leàh’s photo doesn’t do her justice. She made a few conquests even before she came across Ronnie!”\nThe waiter wheeled a neatly arranged trolley into our private dining room. Lifting the elegant silver domes from the dishes, he placed a vegetarian cutlet in front of Pilkin and a trout in front of me. He then removed the bottle of Karmel Hock from the wine cooler, extracted the cork and waited politely as, at Pilkin’s suggestion, I tasted the tart wine. As soon as I nodded appreciatively, he filled our glasses, placed the bottle back in the container, and withdrew discreetly.\n“Well, Bushi. So now it’s the time to tell our stories. Why don’t you start?”\nHis expression as my Odyssey unfolded confirmed that he had kept a close watch of my progress. He displayed no surprise when I recounted my life as a young, unattached, bachelor in Singapore in the early sixties and the saga of my long yet unhappy marriage. The story of my pleasant years in New Zealand, the enjoyable trips in the country’s two islands, and my tense yet industrious existence as a Professor at Monash University in Melbourne brought a wry smile to his face. His looked sombre when I told him how I had, to my own surprise and after agonising for months, turned down the Professorship in Banking Law at London University and, eventually, took up a less prestigious but better paid post in booming Singapore.\n“So you gave a miss to the Moon and grabbed the Six Pence!”\nPerturbed by his condemnatory tone, I related the tangled domestic and personal considerations behind my decision. To start with, my wife had never found herself at home in New Zealand and Australia and wished to return to Singapore. In addition, her failing eyesight would have posed obstacles to her mobility and freedom of action in an alien metropolis like London. For instance, she would be unable to use the underground system.\nI too faced problems. I lacked the gumption to proceed without her and feared the emptiness of a lonely existence. And I dreaded the cold and wet English winters.\n“I understand, Bushi. So, all in all, your career leaves little to be desired. You went up and up throughout and your decision to move to Singapore and give a miss to London is understandable in the circumstances. What is most impressive though is that even now, when many of our old classmates are happy to wash the dishes and play with their grandchildren, you try to climb new peaks in your professional life. What a pity you didn’t show the same determination in your personal life!”\n“Pathetic?”\n“No, Bushi – I’d rather say: true to character. You never sorted out your Achilles heel!”\n“Which was?”\n“Your penchant for glamour women: I’ll bet Pat was beautiful and self assured.”\n“She was!”\n“Like Rachel Zeitlin?”\n“Not quite. But I didn’t expect to meet a second Rachel: for me she remained the only one!”\n“Were you still in love with her when you met Pat?”\n“Well, yes!”\n“So you married Pat because you didn’t want to remain alone?”\n“One of the reasons.”\n“Don’t tell me you still think of Rachel?”\n“Actually, I do. In the old days Racel was my entire world. So how could I ever forget her? I was miserable when she died a few years ago.”\n“Actually, I saw quite a bit of Rachel during her last few years,” said Pilkin after a reflective pause.\n“How come?”\n“By sheer chance I put my mother up in the same ‘establishment’! I spotted Rachel in the dining room when I came for a visit. Did you know she had to be … interned?”\n“Well, yes; she wrote to me from there: a few months after she … moved in.”\nBreaking our eye contact, I reflected on Rachel Zeitlin’s story. A few years after she had broken off with me, she married an orthopaedic surgeon some five years older than her. As both were career persons, they had their separate daily existences and their home life remained secondary to their professional commitments. About twice a year, though, they left their work behind and travelled overseas, booking upmarket tours.\nThis loose type of union suited both of them: her letters suggested she was happy. Then disaster struck: Rachel experienced loss of memory and started to act in a strange and uninhibited manner. Documents drafted by her became unintelligible and clients complained about her appearance and attitude. A rum letter which she sent me some three months before her internment gave me a shock. Unlike her usual, ironic and pungent communications, it was confused.\nIn the event, it turned out she had succumbed to Alzheimer and could no longer manage her affairs. Fortunately, her husband did not abandon her. He came to visit her regularly in the Sanatorium and did all he could to alleviate her mental sufferings and make her feel at ease. Judging by the letters she kept writing me, she continued to have hours of lucidity. All the same, an underlying depressed tone was always discernible.\n“Did you see Rachel often in the … home?” I asked Pilkin.\n“I called on her whenever I visited my mother. Rachel was always glad to see me: that is, when she recognised me. In her bad spells, she was pitiful!”\n“What did you talk about in her good spells?”\n“Sometimes about politics; occasionally about her past; about her marriage and, Bushi, quite a bit about you.”\n“What did she say about me? Please tell me!”\n“What do you want to know?”\n“Did she have any regrets?”\n“Does it matter?”\n“No, it doesn’t. All the same I want to know; I must know!”\n“Very well then. Rachel, Bushi, did not live in a fantasy world. And she was not an ‘if only’ person. She had made her decision and that was that. And she never told me her reasons. But she had a great deal of affection for you. I believe you kept sending her your publications.”\n“I did indeed!”\n“She displayed them on a shelf in her room. And she told me you had done just as well as she had expected. I believe she was proud of you.”\n“Did she know I was unhappily married?”\n“Your so called ‘hints’ had been pretty clear. She was sorry for you but – I suspect – not surprised. She thought your personal unhappiness spurred you on in your career.”\n“I can’t quarrel with that,” I sighed.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/reunion-in-zermatt/chapter-9/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"1-we-meet\"\u003e1.

I assured Pat that, in due course, we would move back to Singapore.\nDuring this second spell at Monash, Marcus kept me informed about Ranjan. Politically, Ranjan moved from strength to strength. Within a few years, he became the President’s right-hand man. He was now tipped ‘the successor’ and, in his own way, wielded power and influence. But – all in all – he had remained a subordinate. The reigns were still in his superior’s hands. Occasionally, Australian television showed him in the company of other members of the Sri Lankan cabinet, assembled around their leader and ready to run his errands.\nThen came the Tamil rebellion. The large minority, with its headquarters in Jaffna – on the Northern tip of the island – stood up for its rights. The Tamils were ill-equipped, poorly led but resolute. Their demands could be summarised in one word: independence.\nA farsighted leader might have agreed and proceeded with partition. The incumbent was not a man of compromise. Following some vain attempts to avert massacres, he sent his army to quell the rebellion. One of the Government Ministers had to be put in charge. He was not supposed to lead the operations; that task was left to army men. They, however, were to report to him. Politically, the Minster was to be a buffer between the sordid ground operations and their originator. In essence, the President felt the need to keep aloof; but, to ensure that his strategy of methodical destruction would be observed, he needed a reliable man.\nHis choice fell on Ranjan. I am confident that Ranjan did not volunteer. He had no wish to soil his hands in an act of genocide. But he had no choice. The fear of prosecution for his personal act of vengeance was still hanging over his head; and he knew that his party had a comprehensive dossier respecting the episode.\nRanjan looked impressive in his neatly tailored Khaki uniform, described by the television broadcaster as the symbolic attire of a Minster at War. All in all, he appeared the epitome of John Bull cast in dark brown.\nRanjan was effective. The less told about the episode the better. Still, despite the meticulous planning complemented by the army’s ruthlessness and savagery, the outcome was indecisive. The victims were innocent civilians and their families, including old men, women and children. Entire villages were laid bare. But the Tamil Tigers – the fighting terror force – withdrew to the Indian mainland. The Sinhalese could not pursue them there. When Ranjan’s army left the North, the acts of terror were resumed. The Tamil Tigers had crept back to their war-torn homeland. Sinhalese cabinet members and their families became a prime target.\nRanjan, though, escaped the Tamil Tigers’ wrath. In a speech, broadcast when his army let go of the land it had rampaged, he lamented the sufferings his troops had inflicted. Shedding tears, he exclaimed: “Your sufferings are my sufferings.” Were the Tamil freedom fighters moved or did they realise that Ranjan had been nothing but a tool? Did they know that Ranjan had no choice but to take orders?\nAbout two months after the end of the bloody campaign, Marcus delivered an unexpected message from our mutual friend. Ranjan had remarried and his second wife was expecting a child.\n“He didn’t send me an invitation; not even a note,” I couldn’t help complaining.\n“It was a very small and informal occasion,” soothed Marcus. “Just family and a few close local friends. Actually, even I didn’t qualify!”\n“A shotgun marriage, then?”\n“No such thing in our country,” protested Marcus.\n“Oh, well,” I retorted. “And is it going to be a boy or a girl?”\n“A girl.”\n“He must be disappointed,” I observed.\n“They’ll have to try again,” affirmed Marcus, himself a father of three sons and four daughters.\n“How old is his wife?”\n“About thirty, I think: young!”\nMy conversation with Marcus reminded me that both Ranjan and I were into our fifties. Professionally each of us was at his peak. On the personal side we were also settled. There was, at the same time, a marked difference between our respective home fronts. After numerous tribulations, Ranjan found a suitable spouse. He had displayed the courage and the determination to get out of unhappy liaisons. True, he started a family late in life; but, in the very least, he was on his way home. In contrast, I lacked the gumption to start again, I remained in the frying pan.\nTo avoid suffocation, I heeded my wife’s demands and moved back to Singapore. My main hope was that the move would salvage what was left of my home life. I was aware that the prognosis was negative. Life had taught me that time was a great healer of wounds: it helped the scar tissue to grow. But it was not a tool for solving existing problems. In that realm the scalpel was more effective.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/a-candid-obituary/chapter-9/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAt the end of my year of leave, we returned to Melbourne.

This answer is set out in chapters 38 to 41. These comprise two speeches, which God delivers from the Whirlwind [סערה]. Greenstein points out that here God “assumes a hostile persona – that of the storm god.”1 He goes on to explain that, in Middle-Eastern mythology, the Storm God is a warrior. Undoubtedly, the retorts are both hostile and condescending.\nIn the first (comprising caps. 38 and 39), God refers to his own magnitude. He tells Job that, as Job was not present when the earth was created, he is not in a position to criticise or raise queries respecting a divine plan of which he has no knowledge.2\nJob’s replies thereto is muted. He says: “Lacking respect, how can I answer? My hand I place over my mouth. I have spoken once and I will not repeat; Twice – and I will (speak) no more” [40:4-5].3 Here Job does not concede his having received an answer to his complaint. He avers that he has not doubted God’s greatness, but that the theodicy issue has not been resolved.\nGod, thereupon, speaks once again [caps. 40:6 to 41]. This second reply differs from the imagery of the previous one. Whilst His first reply asserted His generic greatness, He now refers to two wonders, namely the ‘behemoth’ and the ‘leviathan’, and challenges Job to control them. God displays his anger at Job words, asking him: “Wilt thou disavow my judgment? Wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayst be right? Has thou an arm like God?”[40:9]. However, as in his first speech, God does not explain why innocent people, like Job, suffer.\nJob’s reply thereto does, once again, falls short of conceding God’s justice. In his own words: “As a hearing by ear I have heard you, and now my eye has seen you. That is why I am fed up. I take pity on ‘dust and ashes’!” [42:5-6]. Greenstein tells us: “Job understands the deity to be exactly as he had feared: a purveyor of power who cares little for people. Parodying the divine discourse through mimicry, Job expresses disdain toward the deity and pity toward humankind.”4 Job has done so earlier5 and his reply to God’s second speech does not depart from his original bitter and disillusioned stand.\nIt should by now be clear that Job does not resolve the theodicy issue. The inadequacy of the comrades’ arguments is pointed out in chapter 32:3, discussed above. Neither God’s replies nor Elihu’s speeches provide an adequate answer.\nNonetheless, chapters 38 to 42:1-5 give rise to a number of intriguing issues. First, the vocabulary and the imagery of God’s Replies from the Whirlwind differ from those of the poet who composed the setting and the debates. At the same time, the composer of the Replies has read the earlier parts of the book. For instance, he refers to the same heavenly constellations as Job.6 Further, he replies to Job’s complaints although he does not cite them verbatim.\nAre these replies contemporaneous with the rest of the books or were they written later on? Passages of God’s Replies appear in the Qumran Scroll.7 This establishes that they formed part of Job as circulated in the first century BCE. It is true that scraps of the Hebrew text on this point were not discovered amongst the Dead Sea Scrolls. The relevant chapters are, however, set out in the Late Targum8 and in the LXX.\nThus, the available sources do not provide a clear conclusion as to the date of God’s Replies. In view of the concluding sentence of chapter 31, discussed above, it seems likely that the original version of Job ended with Job’s seminal, final, monologue. However, a book with such a conclusion would have been unacceptable to the Pharisee theology which developed after the destruction of Jerusalem in 71 CE. The book survived and was included in the MT due to the addition of God’s Replies from the Whirlwind.\nThe second issue which arises as regards chapters 38 to 42:1-6 is whether they were composed before or after Elihu’s speeches (viz. caps 32 – 37). The point is of considerable difficulty. Both tracts postulate a divine order, which is beyond the scope of mankind’s comprehension. Circumstantial evidence suggests that Elihu’s speeches were added after the debate but prior to God’s replies. To start with, Elihu’s discourse does not add much to Job, as comprising the setting, the debates and God’s Replies. It simply underscores or clarifies the notion that God’s ways are just and beyond mankind’s grasp.\nIn addition, neither God’s Replies nor the epilogue refer directly or indirectly to Elihu’s words. If the author of the Replies had studied Elihu’s analysis, his easiest way would have been to add a brief indication of God’s agreement thereto.\nFinally, Elihu’s speeches and God’s Replies from the Whirlwind do not cross refer. This, too, indicates that the respective authors were unfamiliar with the writings of each other.\nThe tentative conclusion, then, is that both Elihu and the composer of God’s Replies felt the need to retort to Job’s bitter complaint and his negative assessment of divine justice. They worked independently and it is only natural that the editor of the book included both God’s Reply after Elihu’s discourse. He gave God the last word.\nThe tentative conclusion prescribed by this analysis is that an original version of Job, ending with chapter thirty one plus the epilogue, was ‘censored’ by later compilers so as to save an apostate book, expressed in sublime poetry, from suppression or destruction.\nOp. cit., p. 165.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe first at p. 165. Two verses of cap. 40 pose a problem. God appears to ask again whether an accuser of divine justice deserves a reply. It is possible that these words are the commencement of an extra speech of God, which has not come down to us. They do not add anything to the discourse.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nTranslation of Greenstein, op. cit., at p. 176.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nGreenstein, op. cit., at pp. 184-185, which also sets out the passage from Job just quoted.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nIn 9:22-23, cited above.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nCp. cap. 9:9 with 38:31, both of which refer to Pleiades and Orion.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nDJD23, pp. 149-168; Jongeling, op. cit, pp. 57 et seq.; Sokoloff, op. cit., pp. 86 et seq.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nSee Mangan, op. cit., pp. 83-90.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/essays/job-reassessment/part-10/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAs has been shown earlier, originally the debates conclude with Job’s monologue, in which he reassert his innocence and once again requests an elucidation by God.

I admired the skill she showed as she steered us through the congested traffic. To my delight, we got the very table we used to occupy in the same restaurant in times past.\nRachel grinned again as I devoured the excellent dishes. During the first two courses we talked about the case. Rachel was happy with the settlement but, like myself, continued to wonder about Fischer. Why would an experienced expert witness step out of line for no apparent reason? He knew I had been instructed to handle him with silk gloves. What had induced him to become antagonistic when the reply was obvious and harmless?\n“I suspect there is a reason,” Rachel opined.\n“Boaz will tell me all he knows tomorrow over lunch.”\n“I too would like to know. But honestly, we’ve dug deep enough for the time being. Tell me a bit about your life in Oxford and in Singapore.”\nFor the next half hour, I told Rachel about my isolated but fruitful existence in Oxford: my well heated but lonely room, the junior common room and the pleasant strolls along the Cherwell and Addison’s Walk and my occasional trips to Woodstock. I then told her about my experiences as a teacher in Singapore, as a resident fellow in one of our halls and about the splendid meals in the canteen and in Chinatown.\nRachel, in turn, told me how she had met Uzi, how they went together to concerts, to the theatre and to the cinema and about their recent trips overseas. It was clear she had brought her ship home.\n“I’m glad you’ve got there, Rachel.”\n“But how about you, Eli? Do you have any regrets or hurt feelings?”\n“I’m sorry things did not work out for us. But I remain deeply grateful to you.”\n“For what?”\n“You transformed me from an immature boy into a young man. I shall always think of you with affection.”\nAs we were getting ready to leave, Rachel mentioned that my mother told her about the girl I had met in Singapore. Rachel wanted to know more about the girl and about my plans. Was I going to settle in Singapore?\nShe smiled happily when I told her Pat was beautiful and had a presence. Still, Rachel manifested concern when I told her Pat did not share my interests in art and literature and had no academic bent. She was, further, perturbed by Pat’s ardent Christianity. Rachel knew I was either an agnostic or an atheist. At the same time, Rachel knew that my revolt against Faith and Judaism concealed a firm commitment to the tribe. She did not think I would never be happy if I were induced to change my religion. She was reassured when I told her how much Pat cared for me and that Pat’s family had welcomed me as I was. They knew I had no intention of changing my skin.\nRachel realised that my plans had been worked out neatly. The University provided subsidized accommodation for its staff and did much to encourage expatriate staff members to stay put. Both financially and in terms of prestige, my future was more secure in Singapore than it could ever be in Israel.\nFor a while Rachel reflected. She then summed up with the confidence and clarity she manifested whenever she dealt with an issue.\n“Look, Eli, in these personal matters every person has to make his own decision. But I want to give you one solid advice: be guided by your instincts. Personal decisions concerning a relationship, a union or a divorce are not dictated by reason. They are produced by emotions. In that area, instincts provide the best guide. Even in a courtroom skirmish they have a role to play. Still, reason often forces you to suppress them. This should not happen in your personal life.”\nRachel drove me back to my parents’ flat. Before we parted, she asked me to give her regards to mother. In a sense, she transported me back to the place from which I had come over to her originally.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/scaffolding/part-10/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eRachel was waiting for me when I arrived sharp on time.

The food was wholesome and cheap even if plain. Boaz dug enthusiastically into a dish of aubergines and okra (called Bamia in our part of the world) and, for a while, was oblivious to what was going on around him. When he finished, he licked his fingers, grinned and asked amiably: “Well, what do you think of today’s proceedings?”\n“Simha’s speech left an impact on the Judges.”\n“You, too, were moved!”\n“At our age, we are supposed to be emotive. The Judges, in contrast, are old hands!”\n“A nice aphorism,” chuckled Boaz. “I suppose you haven’t heard about ‘old fools’ and ‘sugar daddies’. As a rule, such ‘prodigies’ are well beyond the great ‘passions’ of life. But this does not stop them from ‘falling’!”\n“True,” I conceded. “But how about Judges?”\n“They are human,” replied Boaz. “And believe me: to them too that unmentioned injury was the coup de grace.”\n“You are right. And you deserve to be congratulated. Simha will get a pretty decent award from them.”\n“You congratulated the right person earlier on,” Boaz spoke sombrely. “We, Eli, were nothing but the paraphernalia! Simha won the day: it was his hour of glory. And Solbon rose to the occasion. But they, Eli, did not lose their cool.”\nI knew what was on Boaz’s mind. In the long run, the payment of a lump sum – be it as substantial as may be – would cost Solbon and their insurers, Rotem, less than the pension offered to Simha. The pension was bound to go up with inflation and, over the years, the medical bills could escalate alarmingly. Simha’s wages, too, would have gone up periodically, reflecting escalations in the cost of living. Indeed, if Simha had accepted the generous offer made to him, he would have remained a long term liability on the books of Solbon or Rotem. A lump sum obviated this problem.\n“But, Boaz,” I quizzed. “Suppose Shimon loses the money: won’t Solbon do something to alleviate Simha’s plight? Won’t they feel sort of obliged to provide some assistance?”\n“I doubt it. They won’t be under a legal obligation to do so and they’re not a charitable institution.”\n“How about Dagan? The decision to drop contributory negligence and the instruction not to reply to Simha’s speech must have come from him.”\n“Probably; but it wasn’t just his decision. The Trade Union and a group of Simha’s buddies did their own ‘little bit’ of pushing. I coached them. And, in any event, don’t you make any mistake about Dagan. In the army he was reputed a fair but hard man. If you asked for ‘justice’ he’d listen. If you looked for ‘clemency’ or ‘pity’, it was better to turn to someone else. In our case, Dagan ensured Simha got maximum compensation. But once Simha got justice – whatever this may mean – Dagan would feel he’d done his ‘duty’. Simha won’t get any more help from him.”\n“Are you sure Dagan is like this?”\n“When Dagan’s daughter bombed her first year at the University, he consoled her and raised the money to give her a second chance. When she panicked in the next year and failed again, he told her she was on her own.”\nBoaz got things right. In the ultimate, the two of us were soft touches. In contrast, the world around us was hard, unsentimental and uncaring. This meant that Simha Balani’s future depended on Shimon’s business acumen. If the son did well, the crippled father would thrive. If Shimon failed, Simha’s lot would turn into sheer misery. Malka would take the brunt of it, but he, too, would suffer. Dejected and disillusioned, they would slowly waste away. True, Shimon might still try to do the right thing by his father. But much would depend on the girl Shimon married. If she was a selfish, unkindly woman, she would drive a wedge between father and son.\n“Do you know what Shimon proposes to do with the money?” I asked. “Hopefully he’s not putting it into an unsound business.”\n“I have no idea. Time will tell.”\n“So, despite a phenomenal award Simha may still be the looser.”\nAt 2.00 p.m. the Court reconvened. Boaz explained that the plaintiff had to return to Tel Aviv to attend his physiotherapy session. Nodding sympathetically, the President delivered the Court’s unanimous judgment. Emphasising the case rested on its own facts and should not be regarded a precedent, Simha was awarded the unheard amount of IL400,000.\nBoaz got ready to take the train back to Tel Aviv. Miri and the children were expecting him. Having some time to kill, I accompanied him to the station, then situated in the German Colony.\nAs soon as we entered the cafeteria, I raised a question that had been weighing on my mind. “Who, then, who is the real gainer? Surely not Simha! His lot depends on Shimon’s business acumen.\n“I agree. Still, he had his hour of glory when he addressed the Court. It’s a memory he’ll cherish for the rest of his life!”\n“And, as we’ve also agreed, Solbon and Rotem aren’t the real losers,” I pointed out.\n“True. They’ll be glad to wipe the liability off their books. And they’re bound to get a favourable Press for their ‘decent behaviour’! They’d love being called ‘fair players’!”\n“How about the ‘contributory negligence’ point?”\n“Baram’s Committee will take care of it. The cost incurred by Rotem’s will be covered by a rise in premiums. Their ‘loss’ will be passed on to policy holders. So, it ain’t a big deal.”\n“Are we – I mean you and me – the losers, then?”\n“Not really, Eli. All in all we had a relaxing day in Court and both of us left a good impression. If we remain in practice, the appearance might stand us in good stead in time to come! Still, neither of us had the chance to shine: we ain’t big winners either!”\n“Who then is the winner – Shimon and his partners?”\n“Not if they lose the money; and I think they will.”\n“So, it is a case without real gainers and losers?” I asked rhetorically.\n“Except that, perhaps, the two of us got a better understanding of the working of our venerable law.

And if you travel through Germany you are bound to find good porcelain,” I said with a touch of envy.\n“I’ll make the best to get some,” he grinned. “But look, before I leave I want to make suitable arrangements for him. Will you please look after him?”\nI had no doubt about the contents of the small olive-wood box he shoved into my hand. As I opened it, Harley smiled at me. Unable to contain myself, I caressed his sparkling jacket with my index finger.\n“He likes you,” said his owner.\n“But how will you manage without him? Surely, he hasn’t stopped talking to you?”\n“Of course not. But I am pushing on and in Hamburg I shall have a day to day existence. For myself, this is acceptable. But I can’t bear the thought of his ending up in an old curiosity shop and this time falling into the hands of a Philistine. With you he would be as safe as he had been with me. Please take him.”\n“Thanks,” was all I managed to bring out.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ravages-of-a-guillotine/part-10/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe matter was now settled.

When the medical report was in, I convened the firm’s pre-trial ‘conference’, chaired by Jacob Keren in person. Shortly before the appointed hour, Hannah Hod slipped into my office. She looked invigorated, had put on weight and, to my delight, had taken the trouble to make herself up.\n“And how are you, Eli? I hear you have moved up in the world?”\n“Eh?”\n“Oh, I am not suggesting you got a promotion. I am no longer a party to such little secrets. But I’m told that you have risen high in the esteem of one Rachel Zeitlin, although she won’t go to another dance with you unless and until she finds a pair of steel framed shoes!”\n“I did tread on her toes once or twice,” I admitted shamefacedly. “But I thought that even so she enjoyed the evening?”\n“I’m sure she did. But I suspect she prefers to take you to the opera, the Philharmonic Orchestra, Habimah, cinemas, posh restaurants and let me not guess where else!”\n“Hannah!!!”\n“Calm down, Eli: my motto is: ‘live and let live’. But, seriously, you better take care not to cross the point of no return blindfolded!”\n“Rachel and I have a good working relationship,” I stated lamely. “But I do like to go out with her – she is fun.”\n“I’m glad you enjoy her company. How do you find her as a lawyer?”\n“She is a fine courtroom advocate.” Indeed, Rachel could be as aggressive a cross-examiner as Hannah but also knew when to pull her punches or opt for a tactical retreat.\n“But don’t you have to do some of her thinking for her?”\n“She’s not an Ehood Morag on points of law.”\n“So, you may complement one another. Well, then, best of luck to both of you. But now we better trot over to Jacob Keren’s office. He won’t appreciate being kept waiting!”\n“Nice to see you again, Hannah. And how do you find your new post?” Keren, I noticed, looked at peace with the world. His ruddy complexion and relaxed expression attested that his spell in the Greek Islands had agreed with him. Just for once, he appeared to be at the top of the world.\n“I’m fine, Mr. Keren. And you look splendid. Well, what do you think of our present matter?” Hannah pressed ahead.\n“Joseph Almog’s reports confirm that Valentino is back on the dancing floor. But dear Omri restricts himself to social dancing. And Dr. Shaked thinks this is all he’ll be able to manage for the time being. So it seems to me we better to crush his claim for loss of future earnings and settle the loss of enjoyment of life claim. Omri is getting married, has the courage to plan a move to Be’er Sheva and, generally, shows no signs of becoming a social pariah or a dejected recluse. I think that settlement for an amount of IL18,000.00 sounds reasonable. What do you think, Hannah?”\n“I still want to tackle him on both counts. I know that our Omri won’t win another Rumba trophy. But Almog’s reports show he continues to enjoy a full life: so, isn’t his ‘loss of enjoyment of life’ nominal?”\n“Eli?” asked Keren.\n“I’m not so sure. A man can put a good face on his ‘loss’ but go on losing sleep over it. Suppose Omri tells us: ‘My big dream was to be the greatest Rumba dancer ever. I can’t bear the thought of giving it up!’ Honestly.”\n“Sounds highly articulate to me,” observed Hannah.\n“Don’t you think Boaz will coach him?”\n“But then, why don’t you think he’ll coach him on the loss of earnings?”\n“Because I don’t think Boaz knows what you have up your sleeve!”\n“But surely, Omri must know some dental technicians work from a wheelchair!”\n“He may – but I don’t think he has told Boaz!” I said with confidence.\n“He can’t be that dumb!” countered Hannah.\n“I agree with Eli,” interceded Jacob Keren. “Many cases are lost because the client keeps facts from his lawyer. Such idiocy is more damaging than the other party’s brilliant tactics!”\n“Well, then, what do you suggest?”\n“Tread carefully on the ‘loss of enjoyment of life’ issue and go to town on the ‘future earnings’. Perhaps you should start with the former and leave the cross-examination on the latter for a devastating finale.”\n“I’d rather crush Omri at the start!” said Hannah.\n“Well, you are in charge. But I advocate extreme caution on the dancing issue. To my mind, Omri has been surprisingly candid with our esteemed Mr. Almog. Beware of the double bluff!”\nFor a moment I glanced at my boss in amazement. Usually, Jacob Keren would have insisted that his tactics be adopted or, in the very least, would have kept arguing. It then dawned on me that his acquiescence was natural. Although the Omri Tal matter remained, nominally, a case handled by J. Keren \u0026amp; Associates, the lead lawyer was Rotem’s new in-house counsel. In the circumstances, Keren saw no need to persevere.\nHaving concluded our discussion of the strategy, we turned to the nitty gritty details of Omri Tal’s claim. A meticulous calculation, carried out by Jacob Keren with the aid of his old fashioned adding machine, convinced us that a settlement should not exceed a total of IL19,000 or 20,000 at the most. As Boaz had told Ruth Schwartz, he would not “even consider” a settlement for less than IL27,000, we were reluctant to make an overture.\n“I suspect the best time for a frank chat will be a day or two before the trial,” observed Jacob Keren. “They’ll feel less confident by then!”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/the-luck-of-valentino/part-10/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eOmri  Tal  saw  Dr. Alon Shaked before the end of the  month.

From time to time, when the weather permitted, I hired a car and drove us down to St Albans, Windsor or Oxford and, on many a fine spring day, to Hampton Court. Like most visitors, we continued to get lost in the maze and invariably had to wait, with the rest of the crowd, to be guided out by one of the warders.\nAnother excursion we enjoyed was a trip up the Thames to Richmond or Kew Gardens. Despite his advancing years, Peppi rose to these occasions and, more often than not, spurred Lucy and me on to yet another stroll through the grounds. Another successful venture was our day at the Derby, where Peppi, properly attired with a carnation in his buttonhole, received many admiring glances from women of all ages. His chest swelled with pride!\nPeppi’s mind, too, had remained agile and active. He was invariably the winner when, sitting by the fire, we played a game of Dominoes or Monopoly. Lucy, I regret to have to relate, was a poor strategist and I had a habit of taking unreasonable chances. Peppi was also victorious on the many occasions we played Tarrock, the national card game of Austria. Although Lucy and I were proficient players, we lacked Peppi’s innate wit and his knack of sending out misleading signals. If Lucy or I won a game it was, usually, by luck rather than by good management.\nAs the years slipped by I did, of course, notice that Peppi’s age began to catch up with him. Frequently, his legs were painful and, eventually, even our regular strolls on Hampstead Heath became shorter and shorter. All the same, I shut my eyes to the inevitable: I was too happy to anticipate the inevitable. In the end, it was a long conversation with Peppi that alerted me to the realities of the situation.\nThis revealing exchange took place on a cloudy autumn evening, following a hearty supper in the comfortable dining room in Hampstead. Having helped Lucy with the dishes I went up to Peppi’s sitting room. To my surprise, he had uncorked his special bottle and was taking small sips from it.\n“I thought you kept the bottle in the shop, Peppi.”\n“These days I bring it home with me in the evening, Peter’le. Sometimes I need a drink before I go to bed.”\n“Is something wrong?”\n“I can’t make up my mind about my will!”\n“Why is that so difficult, Peppi?” I asked. “I’ve always assumed the bulk will go to Lucy. Still, I’d be careful in one regard.”\n“Go on.”\n“There is much altruism in Lucy. My advice would be to tie up what you leave her in an iron clad trust – for her own protection, I mean.”\n“You’re not afraid some chap may get the better of her?”\n“I think she’s pretty world-wise there. No, Peppi: I dread the machinations of certain charities and other goody-goody organisations. Lucy may find it hard to say ‘no’ to them.”\n“You’re right there. Well, I’ve already taken care of that. What I’ve left her is invested in an unimpeachable offshore family trust. We needn’t worry about her. But I’ve two other problems.”\n“What are they?”\n“One, Peter’le, is you. I have a right to ask: how well off are you?”\n“I’m alright, Peppi,” I assured him, grateful and touched.\n“I see. But Peter’le, are you sure you have enough?”\n“Honestly, I’m fine. Is the other problem more difficult?”\n“It is,” muttered Peppi. “I don’t know what to do about Anna.”\nI looked at my friend with growing unease. Up to that evening, Peppi had seldom mentioned Anna’s name. I knew, of course, that his second daughter lived in Bremen, had two children and was married to a clergyman. A few remarks, dropped by Peppi from time to time, had alerted me to their estrangement. Even so, Peppi’s muted outburst that evening came as a surprise.\n“I know very little about Anna,” I told him warily.\n“I wanted to tell you about her before. But I found it too painful!”\n“Are you sure you want to go ahead now?”\n“I think I’d better.”\nDespite his efforts to retain his self-control, Peppi’s voice rose and fell as the story unfolded. Twice he had to refresh himself with a swig from his special bottle. At one point – as he told me about the exchange of words after Helga’s funeral – he was close to tears. I sat there spellbound, but, alas, unable to help.\n“So, you see, Peter’le. I have Lucy and you. But Anna, the pet of my early days in Munich, my little doll, has cut me off once and for all.”\n“But you still love her, Peppi,” I said after a pause.\n“That’s the dismal side of it. It’s not as if I had managed to put her out of my mind. The truth, Peter’le, is plain: I crave to have her back; but not at the price of crawling!”\n“She offered you an olive branch, Peppi,” I said lamely, saddened by the pain in his eyes and the stricken expression on his usually serene face.\n“With a barb, Peter’le. If it was an olive branch at all, she made sure I’d reject it!”\n“Do you have any idea what went wrong? What is behind this stupid carrying on? She sounds pretty hysterical to me!”\n“Don’t you think I’ve racked my brain? All I can say is that it simply doesn’t add up! Can you think of anything?”\n“Not really. Have you talked to \u0026hellip; Theophil?”\n“Whose existence you still doubt,” Peppi managed to force a grin. “Well, yes, I’ve raised it with him. But he, too, won’t tell me. He keeps saying: ‘emotions, mon cher Peppi, are not my department’!”\n“Then her stand may be some kind of religious hysteria. But, I fear, we shan’t find out.”\n“We shan’t. But – Peter’le – that’s not my problem for the moment.”\n“What is it then, Peppi?”\n“Should I leave her anything in my will? I want to do the right thing by her, but I’m not sure what this is – in the circumstances.”\n“Is it too late for you to send out your own olive branch – as a prelude?” I ventured.\n“I’m afraid it is! I have my pride! But she’s still my daughter. I still love her.”\n“You are not seriously thinking of disinheriting her altogether? Even if you didn’t love her any longer, you would have to make some provision for your grandchildren.”\n“There can be no doubt about that. But how about Anna and Otto, Peter’le?”\n“By disinheriting a child the parent says ‘Get lost’ from the grave. If you still love Anna, you mustn’t do this. Further, if you left Anna nothing you would create a problem for Lucy. She’d feel miserable about it and would try hard to compensate.”\n“You are very fond of Lucy, Peter’le,” Peppi sidetracked with a smile. “But, yes, you are of course right. Do you think I should leave as much to Anna as I leave to Lucy?”\n“It depends on Anna’s circumstances. I know nothing about them.”\n“Otto gets a reasonable stipend. But he is generous to needy parishioners. From time to time, Peter’le, I make anonymous contributions to his church fund. This way more is left for them at the end of the month. But, even so, they have a tough time. The mortgage payments are heavy, and Anna doesn’t work any longer. My granddaughter is sickly and Anna must look after her.”\n“How do you know all this – from Lucy?”\n“She tells me very little: doesn’t want to worry me. Still, I found out by chance that she sends them money. And I’ve made my own enquiries. I used a reputable private agency.”\n“So you still care, Peppi!”\n“I do!”\n“Good,” I told him. “To make sure they retain the money, you ought to order your executors to pay off the mortgage. And you can leave Anna an annuity. I think that’s the decent thing to do. It’ll give Anna something to think about, Peppi.”\n“What do you mean, Peter’le?”\n“If you leave her nothing, the rift will remain final.”\n“And if I ignore the rift in my will?”\n“Then, if she has a conscience, she’ll have a good look in the mirror!”\n“You are right. Actually, I did not intend to cut her out of my will. But I wanted to make sure I haven’t become a naïve old fool!”\n“What a daft thought,” I protested.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-devil-in-munich/chapter-10/","summary":"\u003cp\u003ePeppi, Lucy and I used to take long walks on Hampstead Heath or in Kensington Gardens.

Pilkin’s Remaining Years in Israel At this point, the waiter wheeled in a trolley with our main courses. As soon as he departed – having re-filled our wine glasses – I said: “Well, now it’s your turn, mon Cher Pilkin – or shall I say Rabbi Zohar?”\n“At you service,” he smiled benignly. “And ‘Pilkin’ will do!”\n“So out with it!”\n“Where shall I start?” he asked, smacking his lips as he savoured the excellent goose.\n“I know you were a founding member of the Israeli Educational TV and that you married Galya Hadar of the Kameri. Thereafter, it’s a blank!”\n“Let me then fill you in,” he agreed readily.\nPilkin related his tale in the classic Hebrew of our youth, embellished sporadically with Yiddish phrases. He emphasised his points with gesticulations I remembered well from our school days and with occasional winks and sly smiles. As he spoke, the years melted away, the slate became clear and his canvass – larger than mine and than life itself – glistened with the rich colours of modern lithographs. Try as I may, my account is bound to remain but a pale shadow of his dazzling performance. But, then, he was acting his own role!\nPilkin’s first two years as a performer at the Israeli Educational TV had been uninspiring. His function was to prepare and occasionally to take part in pedagogically oriented programmes. It was as dramatic, he claimed, as a wild cat’s life in a cage. To keep himself going, he went back from time to time to TA.1 to stage some plays. Mourning becomes Electra – so he said – had been well received.\nHe had also remained in demand, throughout Israel, as a seasoned Tavyeh. After one performance – on a well known secondary stage – he had his breakthrough. On his way out of theatre, he was buttonholed by an elderly Hassid, whose mannerism and accent smacked of New York. Introducing himself as Rabbi Margalioth, he engaged Pilkin in a short conversation culminating with an invitation to come over for a visit to the New World. The Rabbi’s congregation was looking for a suitable Tavyeh and Pilkin appeared the ideal candidate.\nPilkin was undeterred by the challenge of having to play the role in Yiddish, of which he had but a fleeting command. He recognised the chance and was not going to let it slip by. In the event, his performance was a roaring success. In the course of the next few years, he kept shuttling between his permanent post in Tel Aviv and the Jewish theatres in the United States, which kept inviting him regularly.\n2. The Move to New York Then came the next breakthrough. Tavyeh the Milkman was transformed into a musical. As Fiddler on the Roof it became an internationally acclaimed modern classic. Pilkin’s fine Baritone stood him in good stead. His popularity reached such measures that he assumed the courage to sever his link with the Israeli Educational Television. Thereafter, his spells in Tel Aviv grew shorter and shorter. In due course, he acquired a flat in Manhattan. His career as an actor, idiosyncratic as it appeared, was secure. He entrenched himself further by taking on other comic roles, such as Falstaff and the Malade Imaginaire. His appearances, though, were still on secondary stages. Broadway, alas, remained out of his reach.\nPilkin’s realistic life philosophy commanded that he resign himself to a comfortable – even if not spectacular – career as a second rank actor. Destiny – or my beloved Fortuna – had another plan for him. During his years in New York, Pilkin became increasingly friendly with Rabbi Margalioth, attended his Synagogue whenever possible and, frequently, was invited to his home for the Sabbath and for holidays. One Sabbath eve, when the venerable Rabbi had lost his voice in the wake of a severe cold, he asked Pilkin to officiate. Explaining that his accolade was on leave and that Pilkin was his only hope, he assured Pilkin that the delivery of his sermon was an easy task. It had been typed and, if need be, Pilkin could simply read out from the manuscript.\nInitially, Pilkin had his misgivings. He lacked the necessary training and feared he might mess up the lines. But he had become very fond of the kindly Rabbi and, after reading the sermon through several times, decided to have a go at it. To his own surprise, his performance was lauded by the congregation. His youthful resonant voice – which compared favourably with the aging Rabbi’s sonorous manner of speech – cast a spell as did the new life which he breathed into the worn out clichés.\nRabbi Margalioth was delighted with the enthusiastic reports which reached his ears. He felt fatherly affection for the young man he had sponsored. Further, he was convinced that his congregation needed the injection of fresh blood. So he took a bold move. After a consultation with the Directorate of the Yeshiva, he asked Pilkin to join its ranks as a special student. Cross credits, based on subjects taken by Pilkin for his Arts degree in Jerusalem, would enable him to complete the course for Rabbis in two instead of the ordinary four years. If he did well, he would, undoubtedly, be given his first posting upon completion.\n“What was your initial reaction?” I wanted to know.\n“Confusion,” grinned Pilkin.\n“Why?”\n“I had not expected anything like it!”\n“And when you recovered?”\n“I told him I had to think it over. And he said ‘that’s fine’.”\n“Did you agonise over it?”\n“I did, rather! I was at a turning point! If I said ‘yes’, the great dream – Broadway, the Kameri, the West End and all that – would be over. But I realised that this was a one time opportunity.”\n“In the end you accepted – why?”\n“You’ll find it hard to believe!”\n“Try me!”\n“The calling, Bushi! I concluded it was the hand of God. You, of course, would say it was a ‘coincidence’ – the hand of Fortuna!”\n“Quite. But Pilkin, weren’t you frightened – I mean apprehensive?”\n“Of course I was. It meant a radical change of life: from benign, loose, observance to strict orthodoxy.”\n“So how could you even consider such a transition?”\n“For a number of years I had observed Rabbi Margalioth. The association with him influenced my thinking and, Bushi, my view of life. It reinforced my belief in divine intervention in our lives! As you well know, I have always been a believer!”\n“So you were. But, Pilkin, if Rabbi’s Margalioth offer was ‘the hand of God’, why didn’t the calling come earlier? What about the years you spent on your B.A. and on the stage?”\n“These years paved the way, Bushi. I got a first class training at the Hebrew University and on the stage. And isn’t a Rabbi a performer – just like a teacher, a lawyer and, not to mince words, a salesman and a politician?”\n“Quite so,” I conceded.\n“So these years had not been wasted,” pointed out Pilkin. “Not any more than your years in legal practice prior to your academic career!”\n“I get you point. But, Pilkin, were you really able to make yourself believe that God almighty – Providence – lays plans for something as unimportant as a human? Where was the rational support for the step into the blind alley you resolved to take? I still can’t understand!”\n“Can’t or won’t, Bushi?”\n“What d’you mean?”\n“You assume, Bushi, that a step like this has to be ‘rational’!”\n“I do; I do indeed!”\n“What was the name of that 17th century philosopher who tried to establish the existence of Man and of God by applying logical formulas?”\n“Rene Descartes,” I muttered, aware that Pilkin knew his name just as well as I.\n“He didn’t convince either of us or any other analytical thinker? And do you remember the telling retort to his arguments, emanating from one of his contemporaries!”\n“That logical proof is not the way to establish points like these because in issues respecting Divinity and Faith we have to trust our senses, meaning – incidentally – senses and sensibilities or spontaneous perceptions.”\n“Quite,” agreed Pilkin. “Blaise Pascal asserted – and I agree – that in ‘these matters’ you depend on what we call today an ‘act of faith’ – a ‘revelation’!”\n“I haven’t had one!”\n“Neither did Descartes. So he tried to use ‘reason’ and ended up with a tautology! He, too, closed his heart.”\n“Didn’t stop him from being a deeply religious man!”\n“But without a sound base for his convictions! No, Bushi – in the ultimate – you either believe or do not. I did – always have – and so I could hear a Bath Koll – a voice from heaven – – as Rabbi Margalioth’s words kept going through my mind again and again. The Bath Koll urged me to accept.”\n“A miracle, I suppose. Like poor old Josephus’ Bath Koll in the cave after the fall of Jodefet?” I muttered.\n“Now, now, Bushi, sarcasm is out of place here – surely!”\n“True,” I conceded shamefacedly, adding after a short pause: “Well, in these circumstances, you were right to accept. And – Pilkin – in more than one way I envy you. The only voice that keeps going through my mind is shrill and metallic: my wife’s incessant complaints!”\n“That, too, ain’t funny, Bushi!” Pilkin let his irritation show.\n“It’s not meant to be!”\n“In that case, Bushi, all I can do is to sympathise. But, then, how do you manage to carry on? What keeps you going?”\n“A few good friends!”\n“So God has not forsaken you, even if – perversely – you insist on calling his unseen hand ‘chance’!”\n“On this point, we’ll have to agree to disagree, Pilkin. But, please, carry on!”\n3. Pilkin Settles in America Pilkin’s eyes brightened as he covered the events of the next few years. Although he was considerably older than most of the students, he fitted well into the Yeshiva. He had always been a good mixer and in no time was accepted as member of the cohesive group.\nThe formal method of instruction agreed with him. True, most of the courses involved memory work. The training in TA.1 was of great help in this regard. Further, many of the subjects he had read in Jerusalem stood him in good stead. In some cases, the courses in the Yeshiva dealt with the very topics he had covered in his academic courses. Still, in the University, Biblical and Talmudic texts had been analysed critically and structurally, with a clear emphasis on style and language. In the Yeshiva, they were discussed from a religious point of view, giving prominence to the scriptural contexts and to the traditional implications. In reality, a single topic was being reflected in different mirrors. Pilkin enjoyed every minute of it!\nAs anticipated, he completed his course of studies with flying colours and was constituted a Rabbi. Shortly thereafter, Rabbi Margalioth offered to appoint Pilkin his second in command. Pilkin was delighted. His heart told him that – at long last – he had arrived. For the rest of his life, he would have the privilege of guiding his congregations along a path in which he believed. It was a worthy vocation!\n“Did you leave Israel, Pilkin? I mean, did you migrate?”\n“No. I love my country too much. But my spells at home became shorter and shorter and far in between.”\n“What did your wife say to that? Did she join you?”\n“She did not! She had risen high while I was making my second start in New York. By the time I finished my course she was getting lead roles in the Kameri and, occasionally, in Ha’bimah! I had no right to ask her to give all this up. Also, Bushi, ours was a ‘modern marriage’! True, Galya was moderately traditional. For example, she didn’t take pork. But she was a ‘liberated woman’ and believed she had the right to satisfy her basic needs. She encouraged me, too, to have my ‘fun’ in New York.”\n“Did you?”\n“Not after I enrolled in the Yeshiva. But, of course, that was my decision. She couldn’t have cared less!”\n“Humph,” said I, for want of a better phrase; and then added in haste: “so what did you do?”\n“When I got my posting in New York I asked if she wanted to come over. She said she had no penchant for the role of a Rebbezen [a Rabbi’s wife]! So I agreed to give her a Gett [divorce].”\n“I see,” I nodded. “But Pilkin, did you remain in touch with her? The way I did with Rachel?”\n“No, Bushi, I didn’t. My relationship with her was very different from yours with Rachel. You were madly in love with Rachel. You romanticised her and – in a way – you continued to woo her even when it was over. Galya and I had a down to earth marriage. She wanted to demonstrate she had a husband and a family life. In Israel, I wanted to have a wife like her. But I was getting fed up and tired of being on my own in New York.”\n“But weren’t you happy together before you went to New York?”\n“In a way we were: the chemistry was right but emotions ran low. So when it was over, we were done with one another!”\n4. Pilkin Marries Yentl In the event, Pilkin did not have a prolonged celibate. A few months after his divorce, Rabbi Margalioth introduced him to a wealthy Jewish stockbroker in Philadelphia, who had a marriageable daughter. Yentl Jacobs had done her B.A. in a well known college in New Jersey. The course of studies widened her horizons but, all the same, she remained an orthodox, well bred, Jewish girl. Margalioth was confident Pilkin would find her an excellent match.\n“And how did it work out?” I wanted to know.\n“Brilliantly,” Pilkin spoke with feeling: “couldn’t have been better!”\nYentl insisted on having a ‘decent’ Jewish home. They celebrated the Sabbath and the Jewish festivals in a big way. Pilkin enjoyed himself and loved the related social life that replaced his previous austere existence. Their marital relationship, too, brought Pilkin bliss.\nBy the time he took over the Schul from the aging Rabbi Margalioth, Yentl had presented her doting husband with a son and a daughter. She had also used her influence and intuition to secure Pilkin’s rise in the community.\nWhen she discovered her husband’s hidden healing powers, she spread the good news. When success was in view, she came up with the idea of inaugurating the Loeb Zohar Foundation. Grinning, Pilkin conceded that his change of name had also been carried out after a heart to heart discussion with his smart and worldly wife. He had been reassured, when she told him she would rather be ‘Mrs Loeb Zohar’ than ‘Mrs Rosenne”!\n“So you are really happy with her!”\n“I am. She turned me from a drifter into a well balanced and highly respected member of the community. What more could I ask for?”\n“So you brought you ship home!”\n“And the credit goes to her!”\n“And how did you come to spend part of your time back in Israel? Did she have anything to do with this too?”\n“She did, rather. She knew that, in my heart of hearts, I was home sick. So she suggested I accept a second, part time, posting in Tel Aviv: not an easy thing to arrange. Still, Yentl is a first class organiser and knows how to identify and pull the right strings!”\n“And the arrangement worked out to everybody’s satisfaction?”\n“It did indeed!”\n“And is Yentl, too, pleased with it?”\n“Of course, Bushi. Like many American Jews she kept dreaming about the ‘chosen land’! And so her dream has come true!”\n“Well, how many months a year do you spend in Tel Aviv?” I asked after a short pause.\n“Four or five; sometimes six. Recently Yentl started to speak about retirement in Israel!”\n“Not in Tel Aviv, surely?!”\n“No, Bushi, don’t look so apprehensive. We have settled on Zefat!”\n“A lovely spot: Dreamy Zafat’ – the pearl of the Galilee. I’ll visit you there one day!”\n“You are always welcome!” he assured me with a broad brotherly smile; adding: “so now you know my life story!”\n“Not really,” I disagreed. “How bout your offspring. Are they in America or in Israel?”\n“The boy has a job in an electronics firm in Boston. And, Bushi, he’s married out.”\n“Married out?” I let my surprise show.\n“He has!”\n“A Rabbi’s son?”\n“The idols of the school were stronger than the influence of Dad and Mom! Still, he has not changed his religion.”\n“How do you get on with his wife?”\n“Jane is a stunner: she’s beautiful and sweet. Both Yentl and I have come to love her. So, all in all, we are a close family. And Grampa and Grandma adore our grandchildren. But, of course, they go to church!”\n“How do they react to your … attire?”\n“They think I’m cute. And little Mary loves to play with my beard. Last Christmas she called me ‘Santa Claus’. So, you see, we are still a happy family. But, of course, there is no chance of Uzi and his family migrating to Israel. They are Americans!”\n“How about your daughter?” I asked.\n“Sarah studies law in Columbia. She has a Jewish boy friend from an assimilated home. They, too, will stay put!” For a moment he averted his eyes, then added with a strained smile: “We’ll miss our young ones when we settle in Israel. But, Bushi: we have made our decision!”\n“Yentl and you are of the same view!”\n“Indeed! She has become an ardent Zionist. And – between ourselves – I don’t really feel at home in America. I am – will always remain – an Israeli!”\n“You’ll visit your offspring from time to time – surely!”\n“Of course, and I’m sure they’ll come over to see us,” he affirmed. “But it’s not the same thing as living next door to them. Still, Los Angeles or Seattle are almost as far away from New York as Tel Aviv. And Bushi, in the ultimate, the younger generation must make its own way. We did – so why shouldn’t they have the same inclination!”\n“And, of course,” I summed up thoughtfully, “you didn’t uproot yourself when you moved to America. You still have many friends, even a Schul, in Tel Aviv. So you are making a choice between two homes.”\n“Quite.”\n“While I burnt my bridges in Israel long ago and have not forged close links anywhere. My home is where I have a job. Life without an office and working files is unthinkable. I couldn’t bear it.”\n“I know,” said Pilkin. “And, Bushi, this was on the cards right from the start.”\n“From the day Rachel Zeitlin sent me packing, surely.”\n“Even before then. Your liaison with her postponed the day. But sooner or later you were bound to leave in any event! Deep at heart you were and remained a Nomad – no wonder you ended up as a mendicant professional!”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/reunion-in-zermatt/chapter-10/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"1-pilkins-remaining-years-in-israel\"\u003e1.

But even after Ranjan’s untimely death at the hand of a hired assassin, my mind kept mulling through the episode. One evening I slid to my antiques room in Singapore so as to discuss the matter with Tay Fung-Shuo – now replaced by his porcelain Doppelgänger, dubbed Alfie.\n“So you do old antiques dealer honour of unexpected visit,” Alfie chided me.\n“Honour, yes; unexpected, no!”\n“So what can old antiques dealer do for you?”\n“Ranjan problem,” I explained.\n“But, my friend, why is problem?”\nHe listened patiently to my account. He then felt the need of probing. Pointing out I had appreciated the differences between Ranjan’s background and mine, why was I still puzzled by his act of revenge and by his being a party to the brutalities inflicted on hapless people in Jaffna? Why was I unable to accept that the cultural demarcation went deeper than I had anticipated?\n“You also Asian, Mr. Tay. You think you can do?”\n“No, my friend; and you know!”\n“So why Ranjan?”\n“I think veneer – façade like you say – not so deep?”\n“European liberal façade?” I asked.\n“Not so simple,” countered Tay. “European can also torture; also throw acid; and Chinese can.”\n“But what you mean, Mr. Tay. You speak riddle this time!”\n“No, Peter,” countered Tay in plain English. “I mean the façade of civil behaviour. Ranjan knew he was being unjust and uncivilised on both occasions. But his ego got the better of him.”\nAlfie’s had hit the nail on its head. Throughout their school days and their succeeding years of social and cultural adjustments people get over the egotistic (self-centred) ‘I,’ ingrained in everybody by the survival instinct. Unfortunately, in extreme moments of sufferings – leading to fits of poorly camouflaged rage – suppressed feelings break lose and temper takes control driving a person to an irrational act of aggression or violence; and there is no way back.\nRanjan’s course was dictated when he carried out his senseless act of vengeance. From that moment on, hoods like the incumbent President gained a stranglehold over him. Ranjan’s survival instinct left him no option but to take orders. The acid thrower – who had obeyed a base instinctive call of his ego – had to toe the line prescribed by the President, who could destroy Ranjan by withdrawing the political protection conferred on my erring friend.\n“Karma?” I asked Alfie.\n“Not so,” he reverted to our slang. “Is what you call cause and effect!”\n“So, the sufferings of the Jaffna Tamils were – in a way – his sufferings?”\n“Maybe,” nodded Alfie. “But ‘conscience’ – feelings for other people – not your friend Ranjan’s strong point.”\nIt was the civilised man’s verdict of a barbarian. In a way, Alfie’s kaleidoscope moved the coloured glass pieces – the pieces of a jigsaw – more adroitly than mine. All in all, our conclusions were similar. Ranjan had laid the foundation for his own human downfall when he stepped off the trodden path.\n“Thank you, Mr. Tay,” I told my porcelain friend. “You make me see things clear.”\n“Not so,” he summed up. “Perhaps I help you focus. But you not blind; and you know!”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/a-candid-obituary/chapter-10/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eMany years have passed since that fateful turn of events, covering Ranjan’s act of revenge and the atrocities committed in Jaffna.

In 2010 I self-published it as part of The Scales of Fortuna. Nowadays, when I am in my nineties, I have revised it with a view to uploading in my blog.\nMuch has happened in the decades that had elapsed. Following my return to Singapore, I maintained a regular correspondence with Brian Davies. Before long, he made his exit from the City and, as planned, opened an art dealership with his daughter’s friend. All seemed clear on his horizon. His business was thriving. Then, one sad day, I received the death notice of his wife, Ruth. She had passed away peacefully from a heart attack. Initially, Brian remained in London but – after a few months – joined his daughter, who had migrated to New Zealand. Recently one of his granddaughters wrote that he had passed away. To my satisfaction, she described him as Grampa.\nYuan Ming kept shuttling between Singapore and Los Angeles. Apart from her work as an artist, she continued to handle complex – often shady – deals involving new finds in China. During Yuan Ming’s absences from Singapore, I continued to looked after her flat in Katong. For years the custodianship was a pleasure. But as time progressed the lengthy and regular drives to Katong and back to my home turned into a burden. Yuan Ming, who was aware of the situation, thereupon arranged the sale our collection – comprising all the Chinese pieces collected by Tay, by Yuan Ming and myself – as well as the flat.\nWhen the documents respecting the sale of the flat had been executed, Yuan Ming had to fly to Shanghai to conclude a fresh deal. I had intended to accompany her and, once the deal was completed, we proposed to fly together to X’ian to view the finds of a fresh excavation. All plans had been made but, fortunately or unfortunately, I came down with an attack of bronchitis. As I was unable to fly to Shanghai, Yuan Ming proceeded on her own. I intended to join her in X’ian. To my horror, her plane crashed shortly before it landed in X’ian.\nNotwithstanding my deteriorating condition, I flew over to attend the mass funeral of the deceased passengers. I cannot bear to write about the experience. My only relic is the Dancing Harlequin. Yuan Ming had asked me to keep him for her and it continues to grace my European porcelain cabinet.\nYuan Ming’s memory dominates my heart and mind. Occasionally, I talk to her. All the same, I have come to realise that throughout her lifetime I viewed her work with the eye of a loving uncle, failing to wear the glasses of an art critic. I have no doubt that Yuan Ming had the talent and ability to reach the top. But, with the exception of a few works such as the ‘Dawn’ cycle and those executed during our European trip, her work did not meet the final test. Her failure, I believe, is not a consequence of her untimely demise. Her role as an art dealer marred her development. In a sense, that commercialised alter ego, stood in her way.\nSir Arthur Smithies’ memory, too, is fresh in my mind. I continue to admire him. He had been head above shoulders of all modern bankers I know. All the same, I do not feel inclined to talk to him. He had been too remote.\nAs I am taking stock of the situation it appears to me that two forces define an individual’s life: luck and the hidden alter ego. That duplicity is often concealed behind the projected façade. But even in the case of a man ruled by conventional wisdom – like Roger Bates – that alter may take over if Fortuna displays her hidden hand during developments such as war or financial collapse. In some other cases, as in Arthur Smithies’, she steps in and tears of the mask off at an early, often undisclosed moment. In still other cases, as in Yuan Ming’s, she leads a third party, like myself, so as to invoke her alter ego, even if in the end it is not victorious.\nI, too, have such an alter ago. Did it manifest itself due to the after effects of World War II or did Fortuna release him when she directed me to Tay’s shop in China Town? The answer alludes me. But does this matter?\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-hidden-rooms/epilogue/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe penultimate draft of \u003cem\u003eThe Hidden Rooms\u003c/em\u003e was completed when I was in my sixties.

Is it possible that the anonymous author was influenced by Greek culture? The question is of considerable difficulty. The debating technique used in Job is not found in other books of the Old Testament. These comprise historical narration, prophecies of wrath, eschatological and apocalyptic messages and allegories. Terms and metaphors are not defined. It is assumed that the reader understands the meaning of words such as “God” and “justice” For instance, in Ha’Azinu [האזינו] we are told: “He is the rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are justice: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he [Deut. 32:4].1\nIn contrast, the meaning of “justice” [צדק] is one of the issues debated by Socrates and his fellows in The Republic. Books I and II of the tome demonstrate a highly sophisticated and analytical examination of the term. But could this analysis have been known to the anonymous author of Job?\nSocrates was born at around 470 and died in 399 BCE. Plato’s dialogues respecting Socrates, including The Republic,2 were composed between Socrates’ death and Plato’s first trip to Sicily in 387 BCE. It is believed that they became well known throughout the Levant as indeed were other writings respecting Socrates, such as Xenophon’s Memorabilia and Aristophanes’ Clouds. However, and as stated above, these appear to have been composed after Job.\nAt first glance, this suggests that Job could not have been influenced by these works or by Greek philosophy. The dialectic, or debating approach, was however used in Greek politics even before it permeated into philosophy. It was the method used in debates at the Athens Assembly.\nAn attempt to unveil the origin of these Greek polemics is outside the scope of this investigation. Suffice it to emphasize that two friends of the young Socrates – Pericles and Alcibiades – were masters of rhetoric.3 Notably, Pericles’ consort, Aspasia,4 was well acquainted with Socrates. It is likely that her skills influenced the young philosopher, were adopted by him during his later years and, in due course, became the basis of the debating or dialectic approach employed in Plato’s dialogues. If this were the case, the technique of Athens’ political leaders was likely to have been known to the author of Job.\nThat Job uses the debating, or dialect, approach is clear. A proposition – namely theodicy – is posed and discussed at length. Undoubtedly, some books of the Old Testament have lengthy statements of an issue, such as the duty to observe law. Isaiah and Jeremiah are examples in point. Others concentrate on the praise of God. Psalms provides the best illustration. Other books still, for instance, Judges and Samuel\\Kings are of the narrative gender.\nFurther, the dialectic method is alien even to Biblical Books of Wisdom other than Job. Proverbs and Ecclesiastes set out sharp and usually concise epigrams, which prescribe an appropriate and wise norm of conduct. It is true that, in some instances, the advice or prescription encompasses a number of verses5 but these do not question the issue.\nIt may be argued that the Talmud is renowned for the use of dialectics. This is, undoubtedly, true as regards the later part of the Talmud – the Gemara [גמרא], which was sealed in the 8th century CE. The earlier part of the Talmud – the Mishna [משנה] – does not use it. It is written in resonant Hebrew and was probably sealed by the end of the 2nd century CE. Basically, it includes legal principles and short narraratives. It supports the view that, in the period in which Job was written, dialectics (or the Socratic discourse) were not practised in Judaism. All this leads to the conclusion that, unless the author of Job invented the method on his own, he was influenced by a method common elsewhere, such as Greece at the relevant time.\nThe suggestion that Job manifests Greek influence is not novel. In 1918 Kallen opined: “The Greek influence is … beyond question.” He then explains: “ … we have in the Book of Job … a Hebraized form of the Greek tragedy…”.6\nKallen’s opinion of the influence of Greek tragedy is to be doubted. The impact of the dialectic method is obvious.\nהצור תמים פעלו כי כל-דרכיו משפט. אל אמונה ואין עול, צדיק וישר הוא.

As soon as we had placed our orders, he told me the truth about Fischer. A few days before our trial, Boaz went to have an eye check. As he stepped into the waiting room, Fischer emerged from the ophthalmologist’s room. His eyes were still blurred and so he failed to recognise Boaz. From Fischer’s conversation with the receptionist, Boaz gleaned that Fischer was making an appointment for the removal of one of his cataracts. Dr Much was uneasy about operating on both eyes together.\n“What did you do?”\n“I went over and greeted Fischer. He was embarrassed but after a while blurted out that he had been suffering from cataracts on both eyes for a few years. Dr Much had urged him not to delay surgery any further. It was best to operate forthwith.”\nI looked at Boaz uneasily. Our profession imposed certain ethical doctrines on us. Every lawyer was ‘an officer of the court’. Misleading a judge or suppressing the truth was an offence. Reading my thoughts, Boaz explained he would have discharged himself from the case if had learned the truth earlier on. He was not prepared to leave his client in the lurch just before the trial.\nI realised that, in Boaz’s position, I would have taken the same course. He faced Hobson’s choice: desert your client or compromise yourself. Boaz’s misgivings were allayed when we agreed to divide the case into two separate parts. The ex gratia settlement got him off the hook.\n“I feel sorry for Fischer.” I observed. “No wonder his eyes could not focus. And he lost his cool as soon as my questions got too close to the mark for comfort. Still, now that I know the facts, I can’t understand why they eluded us.”\n“Again, I agree, Eli. I believe Fischer arrived at the site at about eight o’clock. He lost his way as he climbed up. When he realised he had overshot, he returned to the first floor. All this took a while! Impaired eyesight is the obvious explanation.”\n“A man in his condition should not climb up a scaffolding. He was no longer fit for his job. But I can see his dilemma. If the cat got out of the bag, he would lose his livelihood,” I concluded\n“Precisely. Who would employ a surveyor with defective eyesight? Fischer tried to hang on. Well, we know the outcome.”\n“Did Ruth know about his condition?”\n“I suspect she did. Still, to Rotem the ex gratia payment is a mere trifle. Fischer was their regular expert witness. The payment will help to tide him over.”\nAll in all, I found Boaz’s analysis unexceptional. In those early years, any eye surgery was serious. The healing process was prolonged and the prognosis – especially in the case of cataract removals – was questionable.\nHaving exhausted the issues respecting the trial, we turned to personal affairs. Boaz told me all about his life in the Kibbutz, about Miri and about their children. I told him many of the anecdotes I picked up at Oxford. I was amused by the shudder that passed his spine when I referred to boiled mutton. We laughed together when I related my reaction to hot Indian and Indonesian dishes.\nHe also told me about his life as a back bencher of his left-wing party. On some occasions he had to vote with the other MPs even if his conscience pricked him.\n“But surely,” I told him, “in the very least you can bring up the social problems that used to bother up. And you hold the key to law reform.”\n“The trouble is that politician raise questions only when an issue is topical: if it can bring them votes. Many of the idea we have developed, for instance, about fixed pensions for injured parties, are not popular at the moment. Parliament will deal with them when some interested lobbies emerge. Sometime, we can trigger them. But such instances are rare.”\n“Would you have better chances if you moved to the front bench – became a minister?”\n“Marginally. You see a front bencher must always reckon with his electorate.”\n“Still, will you get there?”\n“Time will tell.”\n“If you had remained with the law, you could by now be on the Bench!”\n“Perhaps. But, Eli, I still prefer to slog on in politics. I’ve made my choice.”\nI accompanied Boaz to Tel Aviv’s old bus exchange. He asked when I would visit Israel again. He had been told I had met a nice girl in Singapore and assumed I would marry her and stay put in her town.\n“Are you more content there than with us, Eli?”\n“Difficult to say. You see, here in Israel I shall always be an insider who does not fit in. The best choice of the odd man out is to live away from home. He is unlikely to be ‘accepted’ but, as long as he is sensible, he will be regarded an outsider who moves with the tide. It can be a pleasant existence.”\n“I wish you well, Eli. And, yes, I know what you are talking about. Here, at home, everybody knows everybody. Look at our case. You have known Rachel, Ruth, Fischer Morag and me for years. Your mother, too, knows every person or, in the very least, hard the relevant gossip! It is a small, incestuous, network. True, we are a tolerant lot. Nobody interferes with you if you don’t cross the line. But how many times did you, yourself, do things because you knew they were expected of you?”\n“Most of the time. Worse still, on many occasions I did not raise my voice …”\n“Because you thought it best to shut up?”\n“That too, Boaz. But usually I maintained my silence because ‘acting’ would have been ‘unacceptable’.”\n“And overseas you are a free man?”\n“Not really. Each society has its norms and conventional wisdom. But nobody expects an outsider to be a member of the crowd. In consequence, it is easy to follow the old wisdom of ‘don’t see, don’t hear and don’t speak’. It makes life easy.”\n“I must agree. But you know, Eli: the way back will always be an option.”\n“Precisely. And you can trust me to keep a foot in the door.”\nWe joined the lengthy queue in front of bus stop to Haifa. Most busses left the depot full to the brim. In sheer disregard of local norms, Boaz did not board a congested bus. Shortly after that packed sardines can departed, another bus slipped in. Boaz embarked, found a comfortable seat and let down the window. We kept talking until the bus went on its way.\nMother was not surprised by my revelations. My account of the proceedings had aroused her suspicions. My description of Fischer’s demeanour suggested to her that his vision was down. True, she had not suspected he had cataracts. But she perceived that the explanation of his stupid behaviour could be a deterioration of his eyesight.\nIn my mother’s opinion, Fischer did not deserve much sympathy. You had to take life as it came. Once you reached forty, you had to wear sunglasses or, better still, give the glaring beaches a miss. Fischer had always acted as a young man. In the end, he had to pay a price for his extravagance.\n“How do you know he pretended to be a youth?”\n“Rachel tells me he used to be seen on Herzliya’s beach in the company of girls half his age!”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/scaffolding/part-11/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eBoaz arrived before me.

All Along, I had been perturbed by a sense of helplessness. I wanted to do something for Simha – smart Alec as he might be – because I came to like him. The thought of his wasting away, wallowing in his own filth, appalled me. Without risking my future by crossing the floor, I had pulled as many strings as I could, hoping to work out an arrangement like a pension he could not afford to turn down. Jacob Keren and Ehood Morag, too, did their bit. In the end, though, a commonplace emotion on Simha’s part defeated our efforts. And the law could not and would not intervene.\n“The law is an ass,” I observed.\n“Precisely,” said Boaz. “Even if traditional lawyers call ‘her’ our muse and mistress; and this time Eli, ‘her’ – or rather ‘its’ – stupidity might cause you harm indirectly!”\n“Eh?”\n“You are looking forward to the materialisation of our plans!”\n“As you well know.”\nHe was referring to tacit understanding between Boaz, Rachel, Uzi Bloch of a renowned firm, and myself. As soon as we felt we had learned all we could in our existing postings, we intended to defect and start our new law firm. Boaz was to be the Managing Partner. Each of us knew some banks and insurance companies. In addition, a few commercial firms were going to move their business discreetly in our direction. Our proposed firm had a rosy future. Was Boaz hinting it may all come to naught?\n“I think you got the drift,” Boaz answered the question I did not dare to ask. “I am talking about the partnership we’ve been planning!”\n“What’s Simha got to do with it? His case has no bearing on our plans,” I protested.\n“You are wrong there. Simha’s case demonstrates how little you can achieve as a lawyer! I’ve had misgivings for a while and this case clinches them. And, Eli, you can’t seriously argue that yet another law firm might do any good to anybody?”\n“You are wrong there. It’ll give us a decent living and interesting work!”\n“How about society as a whole?”\n“Occasionally, Boaz, you get a case which enables you to turn the scales – to change the law. And once you are a judge, you can reform the law, even if through the back door!”\n“Like Ehood Morag on this occasion?”\n“True, he failed. But Baram’s Committee will reform the antiquated law of contributory negligence which we got from England!”\n“But Eli: Baram is to head a Committee appointed by Parliament. As a judge, his chances of changing the law arise sporadically: only if a suitable case comes up for decision.”\nBoaz had a point. After four years with Jacob Keren I, too, had lost any illusions about the legal process. Far from being a forum of justice, the courtroom constituted an arena. Its gladiators – the lawyers – conducted their skirmishes – known as trials – by a skilful manipulation of rules of procedure and of legal doctrines. The word ‘justice’ – adroitly brandished by the legal gladiators – was nothing but rhetoric. In reality, Fortuna’s presence in the courtroom was more evident than Justus’. Occasionally, judges could swing a case in the direction of justice but more often than not were satisfied to apply precedents.\n“But, then, what is the answer, Boaz?”\n“A reformer’s place is in Parliament: not amongst practising lawyers.”\n“What are you telling me?”\n“I have decided to leave the law and enter politics. I am standing for election in September: Mapam has asked me to join them.”\nI looked at him in disbelief. Mapam was a radical party. It represented the left wing of the labour movement and of the Kibbutzim. Most of their MPs were commonsense people, with little education or learning. Professionals were conspicuous by their absence from their ranks. What had induced Boaz to throw his lot in with them and how would he possibly fit in? As if he could read my mind, Boaz answered both questions.\n“Miri’s Kibbutz is affiliated to Mapam. Their leadership told her they needed a few professionals in Parliament and so she talked to me. Ideologically, I have identified with their ideals for years. So, you see, Eli, if I’m not going to be too capricious or cocky, I’d fit in.”\n“But, Boaz: do you have the makings of a politician?”\n“What do you mean?”\n“You are a fine lawyer. By the time you’re forty the establishment will clamour to kick you up onto the Bench. If you wait another ten years in the ranks, you’d have every chance of going straight to the Supreme Court. Magor’s job may one day go your way …”\n“Now, now, Eli – that’s pure flattery,” Boaz broke in but, all the same, sounded pleased.\n“You always topped class in Law School!”\n“But …” Boaz prompted.\n“ … do you have the aptitude for politics? The goings can get rough!”\n“Courts aren’t beds of roses,” Boaz reminded me.\n“But in comparison with politics, the goings are smooth and civilised!”\n“I’ll have to adapt. It won’t be easy. But in politics you may leave a real impact on the State: not just on individual cases which come up for decision.”\n“That’s true,” I had to concede.\nIt was clear Boaz had made up his mind. One of my Doppelgängers – the hidden idealist – applauded. The other – the cynic who knew what was going on in law firms and in business – was dismayed. My own dreams were being shattered. And my friend’s future became a cause for concern. I knew Boaz was frugal but, like myself, he appreciated having his comforts; and he enjoyed the standard of living secured by a successful practice.\n“You’ll have to tighten your belt, Boaz. A left-wing politician has to exist on a pittance. I know your aunt in America left you some dough. But for how long can this sustain Miri, the kids and yourself? Even if you wish to make the sacrifice, are you being fair to them?”\n“Miri is all in support. And she’ll pull strings in Mapam. Also, she can once again give some private tuition after work; so, we’ll have two incomes. I won’t let money stand in my way.”\n“You are taking a jump blindfolded, Boaz: think of the risk!”\n“I have; and my mind is made up!”\n“Oh, well; so that’s that,” I said resignedly.\n“But, Eli, Rachel, Uzi and you can go ahead without me. You’ll have to make some adjustments but that’s all. Rachel would be a good Managing Partner. If she doesn’t want the top post you would have to look around.”\n“But, Boaz, it’s not that simple. We expected you to take the lead. Still, we’ll have to manage.”\nBoaz was about to answer when we heard the train rolled in. To secure a good seat, Boaz had to rush into one of the wagons without delay. It took a while before his head emerged from a window of a wagon down the platform. By the time I managed to get there, the closing of the doors signalled the train was getting ready to leave.\n“Give my love to Miri and the kids,” I yelled as the train started to move.\n“Thanks. See you soon in our place,” he called back.\nI could have taken a bus to the hotel in King George street but concluded that a brisk walk back to the City centre would do me good. As it started to drizzle, I fastened my rain coat’s belt and raised the collar.\nGrudgingly, I recalled an Eastern paradigm comparing the world to a pond. The ripples caused by a pebble thrown into it could have far reaching effects. In the Balani case, an accident commencing with a carelessly loaded truck had effected the plans for a new legal partnership.\nFor the time being, though, this fine theoretical analysis had to be put on a back burner. Later in the day I proposed to attend a recital. A young violinist, who was later going to make a name for himself, was playing Beethoven’s Kreutzer and Spring. The pianist was an old classmate, who made a name for herself. It was bound to be a pleasant evening.\nSensing that, in one way or another, the big issues would take care of themselves, I smiled in anticipation of the delightful relaxation in store. It would be a lovely sequel to the ordeal in Court and the subsequent tense conversation of the day. As long as you could still enjoy yourself, you remained both alive and happy. And that – I concluded – was what mattered in our daily existence.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/simha-glory/part-11/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eBoaz’s last words struck a chord. All Along, I had been perturbed by a sense of helplessness. I wanted to do something for Simha – smart Alec as he might be – because I came to like him. The thought of his wasting away, wallowing in his own filth, appalled me. Without risking my future by crossing the floor, I had pulled as many strings as I could, hoping to work out an arrangement like a pension he could not afford to turn down. Jacob Keren and Ehood Morag, too, did their bit. In the end, though, a commonplace emotion on Simha’s part defeated our efforts. And the law could not and would not intervene.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Part 11: Unexpected Development"},{"content":"When I returned to the meeting – having placed Harley in my breast pocket – I found that the matter was not proceedings as smoothly as expected. To be placed before the re-insurers, the settlement agreement had to be written in English. Since 1948, though, the language of the courts had been Hebrew. Our day-to-day precedents were also expressed in the official language. The old English precedents were kept in Jacob Keren’s locked filing cabinet. As both he and his secretary had left for the day, nobody had access to them.\n“But, in that case, draw the agreement up in Hebrew and we’ll translate it later,” I suggested.\n“Doubles the effort,” retorted Boaz.\n“So, what is to be done?” asked Rachel.\nThe situation was saved by Ben Zion, who had lingered behind although the document was to be drafted by Boaz, Rachel and Ruth Schwartz: “I have English precedents in my office. The only trouble is that I have to rush home and so I don’t have the time to bring them over.”\nAs it was late on a Friday afternoon, no further explanation was needed. Ben Zion had to take his shower, put on fresh clothes and prepare himself for the Shabbat before sunset. Although none of the remaining persons in the room took the rites seriously, Ben Zion struck a chord.\n“I’ll come with you,” I offered, “and I’ll take documents back.”\n“Thanks,” said Ben Zion after a brief hesitation. As an observant Jew, he preferred not to be a party to the violation of the Shabbat by a brother in faith. Still, he was aware of my heretical views and, accordingly, overcame his scruples.\nA brisk walk of some ten minutes got us to Ben Zion’s office. In no time he located the required precedents. Seeing I was still out of breath, he offered me a cup of tea. I was about to leave, when Ben Zion said: “You must be relieved the case has been settled. I am, Eli.”\n“In the end, Rotem was generous,” I said.\n“They intended to be. But we had to find good arguments for our forthcoming General Meeting.”\n“I know. And I thought Ruth, Hannah and yourself were really good about it. You must be pleased the manufacturers’ are not escaping scot free.”\n“I am,” he confirmed. “And I must say: Franz Wolf’s lead was a real help. I only hope Dahlia gets the best medical treatment available. My brother is a plastic surgeon. He tells me the attachment of artificial limbs after such an accident is tricky. And, you know, the poor girl will have to go through a series of operations. They can’t do it in one go. Still, the compensation is adequate: she’ll have enough money. I only hope she won’t lose her courage.”\n“I don’t think there’s much danger of that,” I reassured him. “I think she’s got a strong character and a positive outlook on life. She’ll need them!”\n“Yes, she has the will to go through with it. I am not sure we appreciate how rough this has been for her. The very thought of such an accident makes me shudder.”\n“What makes you say this?” I wanted to know, sensing he had some information that had not reached us.\n“My wife’s aunt, Dr Schlossberg, is the medical officer of Dahlia’s school. She goes over a number of times each term to have a good look at the pupils. Usually, if she spots anything unhygienic – like unwashed hands during meals, dirty nails or filthy clothes – she shows the culprit up and delivers a homily. But she never said an unkind word to Dahlia since the accident. Instead, she made sure Rivka helped the girl out: I mean like brushing her teeth for her and other such things.”\n“How awful,” I said. “But, hopefully, the operation will put an end to this. But how about the rest of it?”\n“What do you mean?” asked Ben Zion. “I watched you during the negotiations and sensed something was on your mind. Well, what is it?”\n“Dahlia is not a blue stocking, or a girl keen to set out on a professional career. Before the accident she was a beautiful girl, popular with all her classmates. She had plenty of admirers. And she has the making of an excellent housewife and mother.”\n“And you fear that, even after a successful series of operations, she will be unable to find a suitable husband?”\n“Quite,” I said. “Will any man fall in love and wish to marry a girl in her condition?”\n“I wondered if that kept bothering you,” he nodded.\nFor a time, he remained silent. When he had gathered his thoughts, he expressed his mind clearly and succinctly. Marriages, he pointed out, were delicate arrangements. In our days the majority were based on physical attraction. Frequently, such marriages went on the rocks when the sex appeal was over. The spouses fell apart and, sooner or later, started to look for other partners. He thought that chemistry was not an adequate cornerstone of a good marriage.\n“But surely,” I argued, “if it is not there at all, the marriage is bound to be miserable!”\n“Of course,” he agreed. “Sex appeal, or the right chemistry, is an essential component of a good marriage. But you need more than that: there must be mutual respect, tolerance and some common interest or purpose. These are as important as physical love. They keep a marriage going when passion wanes. They stand the spouses in good stead when romance is no longer there. Really good marriages are based on understanding.”\n“Why is all this relevant in Dahlia’s case?” I asked.\n“Because Dahlia has a lot to offer: a pleasant disposition, a kindly heart and a strong character. A man who wants such a wife looks for a mate and not just a sex partner – and he’ll be happy with her regardless of her artificial hands!”\n“But how about the initial reaction when he meets her. When I spotted Dahlia for the first time, I didn’t know she was the victim of this horrid accident. She hid her hands and so I was impressed with her good looks. But when Rachel told me, my admiration turned into pity.”\n“That’ll be the initial reaction of any man. But, when he knows her better, he might regain his admiration for her character and courage.”\n“I do hope she finds somebody like this! What are her chances?”\n“Difficult to say. But think of the empathy she has developed for Franz Wolf and his patent affection for her!”\n“Based on a feeling of guilt?” I ventured.\n“I don’t think so. Franz Wolf knows she is a good girl. His affection for her stems from his appreciation of her personality.”\n“I hope a younger man – in her own age group – may react to her in this way.”\n“The chances are not too bad,” said Ben Zion. “Don’t you know that some men – especially fellows who are successful with women – settle on plain but decent girls rather than on glamour women? Just think of your friend Boaz. In his student days he was running around with some stunning females. And I’m sure he had plenty of fun with them. But he married Miri!”\n“She’s a splendid girl!”\n“She is,” he agreed readily. “But nobody would call her a stunner. She is a decent, dependable and forthright woman. A sensible man would prefer her to a pretty but spoilt brat.”\n“And Dahlia?”\n“Has most of these attributes. We can hope for the best,” he insisted.\nA glance at my watch disclosed that it was getting late. Rachel, Boaz and Ruth Schwartz needed the English precedent, and Ben Zion had to be on his way home. That he, too, was getting agitated became clear when spoke again.\n“I’d better be on my way. If I am late my wife may fear something has happened to me.”\n“Give her my regards,” I said inconsequentially. “I’ve never met her; but I feel certain she keeps a fine home for you, BenZi”\n“She sure does,” he affirmed, smiling happily in response to the nickname used by his inner circle of friends. “And it is high time that you come over. We’ll arrange something soon.”\nWe walked down the stairs together. As I watched his rapid pace in the direction of the bus stop, I realised I had come to like him. Naturally, our views about the world were miles apart. A close friendship was unlikely to develop. All the same, Ben Zion was a person with whom I could work in harmony. He would be a reliable and accommodating partner.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/ravages-of-a-guillotine/part-11/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhen I returned to the meeting – having placed Harley in my breast pocket – I found that the matter was not proceedings as smoothly as expected.

Boaz looked well and at ease. In contrast, Omri Tal, who was sitting next to him, appeared nervous, even apprehensive. He was talking in undertone with the singularly attractive girl, who was doing her best to calm him down.\n“Glad to see everybody’s on deck,” said Baruch Shoham, having responded graciously when all of us rose to our feet and bowed as he entered the court room from his chambers. Unlike the attorneys, who continued to wear gowns, the judge’s formal attire comprised a black silk jacket, a white shirt with a stiff collar and a sober tie.\n“And you, Mr Tamir,” Shoham added as he relaxed in his comfortable leather chair, “look much better! You must have followed your doctor’s orders to the letter! And it is good to have the privilege of seeing you again in the ranks, Frau Hod. I feared that Rotem’s gain might be our loss of your spirited appearances before us!”\n“No such luck, Your Honour. I’ll continue to be a thorn in the flesh of the courts for years to come, whenever Rotem sounds the all clear!”\nEverybody, including the Judge, guffawed. Then all of us turned our attention to the papers in front of us. Shoham went through his file deftly, as persons do when they are in command of the contents. When he had collected his thoughts, he cleared his throat and addressed both sides: “I take it neither party wishes to raise any objections to, or queries about, Dr. Alon Shaked’s medical report. It strikes me as very clear and meticulous.”\n“Both parties found it most helpful,” confirmed Boaz.\n“So, you have discussed it amongst yourselves?”\n“We have indeed. The defendants agree that, at this stage, it is impossible to state with certainty whether or not the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s injury is permanent. The prognosis is that some disability will remain.”\n“I too read the report in this way,” conceded Shoham. “Can we then proceed on this basis? Are the parties ad idem to this extent?”\n”We are,” confirmed Boaz. “We are, further, agreed that, as Dr. Shaked concludes, the permanent impairment will not be major.”\n“Very well, then. So, unless either party wishes to raise a preliminary point, you, Mr. Tamir, can commence with your opening.”\nFor the next half hour, I listened attentively to Boaz’s meticulous statement of the plaintiff’s case. As often before, I admired his delivery which was as elegant, as clear and as well balanced as any address delivered by Jacob Keren. What impressed me even more was the subtle manner in which he adapted his speech to suit the temperament and orientation of the Judge. Had he appeared before Ehood Morag, Boaz would, undoubtedly, have included prolific references to recent cases, incorporating here and there a pun on some clumsy expression in a judgment cited by him. In Baruch Shoham’s court he covered, assiduously, each and every issue, leaving no corner unturned.\nIt was only when he came close to the end that, as I had anticipated, Boaz made a slip. Turning in the direction of Omri Tal, who was listening to him spell bound, Boaz became eloquent: “So, Your Honour, my client’s dream of becoming a household name amongst dancing fans in Israel has come to an abrupt end! True, his permanent handicap may not be major. Still, he will never leave the dancing floor again as the holder of the trophy awarded for any fast moving dance. True, social dancing, as well as a mediocre performance as an amateur chess player, remain within his reach. But he can no longer hope to become Israel’s undisputed Valentino. His aspirations for success will now be confined to his professional career as a dental technician and even there he will have to cope with a handicap!”\n“But Your Honour,” Hannah had risen to her feet, “doesn’t this argument suggest that, in the ultimate, the plaintiff’s shattered dream will have a beneficial effect on his career? According to the argument just raised, work will become his main solace! Isn’t this fresh motivation bound to drive him from strength to strength in his profession!”\n“The point occurred to me,” observed Shoham. “But how about the adverse effect of his injury?”\n“This question is in issue, Your Honour. May we revert to it later on?”\n“Very well,” said Shoham complacently. It was, however, clear from his expression that the arrow had found its mark. Boaz frowned, bestowed a searching glance on his client and, for just a second, remained lost in his thoughts. He then turned back to his notes and brought his address to a swift conclusion.\n“Thanks for this very comprehensive and clear address,” said Shoham benignly when Boaz finished. “Could you please furnish a copy of your address? I’m sure our notes are accurate but we can’t be too careful!” He was, implicitly, eluding to a problem that had plagued all Israeli courts in those remote days. In the absence of sound equipment, judges and their associates had to take copious notes of everything said in court, including the attorneys’ speeches and the testimony. The parties too kept records. Usually each entrusted the work to a pupil or a secretary and, at the end of each day, the respective ‘notes of proceedings’ were compared and reconciled. In lengthy trials, the process was cumbersome. Court stenographers were, as yet, a rarity.\n“I note that the defendants are not calling witnesses but have reserved the right to call evidence in rebuttal,” observed Shoham.\n“Judging from the opening, I don’t think the need will arise,” answered Hannah.\nShoham let his satisfaction show: “So we can take things easy. It’s only 10.45. Let’s have a 20 minutes break. We can all do with a cup of coffee and the smokers with a cigarette!”\nWhen the proceedings resumed, Boaz put Omri Tal in the box. As was the custom, the first, highly neutral and uncontroversial questions, were asked mainly in order to put the witness, who was fidgeting nervously, at ease. To this end, Boaz invited Omri to tell us about his forthcoming move to Be’er Sheva and, generally, about his plans for the future. As soon as Omri had regained his composure, Boaz turned to the relevant issue. Cutting himself short on the liability issue, which was no longer in dispute, he asked a series of questions about Omri’s injuries and their effect on his work as a dental technician. He also established the extent of Omri’s past losses and laid the foundation for the argument respecting the loss of future earnings. Watching the two of them carefully, I surmised that Boaz had not put the 20 minutes break to good use: he still believed that a dental technician had to do his work standing on his feet.\nBoaz’s questions became more articulate when he turned to Omri’s loss of enjoyment of life. In response to his carefully phrased questions, Omri told us all about the pleasure and pride he had experienced when he won his trophies and about his aspirations to become Israel’s best known amateur dancing champion. Omri readily conceded that, even after the accident, he continued to play an active role in his club as an instructor and guide and that he stepped onto the parquet floor when they organised social dancing evenings. These experiences, though, were a poor compensation for the irreparable loss he had suffered when his great expectations came to such an abrupt end.\n“I have not lost my hope for the future,” Omri Tal affirmed as the examination-in-chief drew to its close. “But, whenever I think of how I performed on the floor before this stupid accident, I feel drained – empty.”\n“No further questions,” said Boaz and resumed his seat on the front bench.\n“It’s too early to break,” observed Baruch Shoham. “But I suspect your cross-examination will take us well into the afternoon, Frau Hod. And how about evidence in rebuttal?”\n“Barring unexpected surprises we’ll do without such evidence. And I may be able to finish just before lunch if we break, say, at 1.00 p.m. or so?”\n“That suits me,” nodded Shoham. “Actually, I have a late luncheon engagement. Let’s agree to break at about 13.00 hours. You can carry on after the break if need be.”\nAs was the norm amongst lawyers trained by Keren, Hannah skimmed through her notes leisurely, straightened her gown and kept frowning. After a while, Omri Tal’s self-assured manner underwent a subtle change. He started to fidget and, once again, looked ill at ease.\n“Well, Mr Tal,” Hannah went straight to the point, “so this … not particularly substantial accident will stop you from rising to the top of your professional career?”\n“If You Honour pleases,” Boaz was up on his feet, “this is a loaded question. Is my Learned Colleague asking whether the accident was substantial or does she want to know whether it will impede the development of my client’s career?”\n“Let me then rephrase the question,” Hannah smiled tightly. “Mr. Tal, will the accident, the subject of this case, stop you from rising to the top of your professional career?”\n“The injury has slowed me down frightfully!”\n“And why is that?”\n“Because I can’t stand on my feet for any length of time. My knee gets too painful and my leg feels uncomfortable!” Boaz’s intervention had helped Omri to regain some of his self-assurance.\n“And a dental technician has to do his work on his feet?”\n“That’s the way I used to work before the accident!”\n“Please answer my question: does a dental technician have to stand on his feet at work! To make myself even clearer: can’t he work in a sitting posture?”\n“My client is not here as an expert witness,” Boaz was up again, trying hard to hide his anxiety. “How can he testify about the work of a dental technician in general?”\n“Does my Learned Colleague suggest he himself is unable to testify about the work of ‘a lawyer’?” Hannah asked sweetly.\nBaruch Shoham smiled and, instantly, gazed awkwardly at an unidentified point in front of his desk. Boaz, in turn, started to make a reply, thought better of it, shrugged and sat down.\n“Well, Mr. Tal: won’t you enlighten us?”\n“I don’t know how other technicians work!” Omri protested, glancing anxiously in Boaz’s direction.\n“Don’t you know Mr Joseph Cohen – the Dental Technician at 56 Herzl Street? I believe he is the Honorary Treasurer of your Organisation?”\n“I’ve met him!”\n“Does he have any handicap?”\n“Really, Your Honour! Where does all this lead us?” Boaz rushed in.\n“I’d better make myself clearer then,” Hannah raised her voice. “Did you, Mr Tal, notice that Mr. Cohen is a paraplegic, confined to a wheelchair!”\n“I know,” agreed Omri cowed.\n“And what is his reputation like?”\n“Second to none,” conceded Omri. “But I only said that I am used to doing my work standing on my feet.”\n“But, if necessary, such work can be carried out even from a wheelchair!”\n“I don’t know how?” Omri was cornered but, bravely, tried to stand his ground.\n“Well, let us see,” said Hannah.\nFor the next thirty minutes, Hannah cross-examined Omri meticulously on each phase and detail in the work of dental technicians. When she finished, it was evident that, with some adjustments and reorganisation of the workstations on the premises, all processes and procedures could be carried out by a technician sitting at a workbench. She proceeded quickly, without pulling her punches, but at the same time kept glancing at Shoham to ensure he was able to keep notes. Using one of the few minutes of respite to steal a glance around me, I caught the immobile expression that had descended on Boaz’s face. A few minutes later, I was taken aback by the hostile glance he bestowed on his wriggling client.\nAt long last, Omri threw in the towel. Mopping the sweat off his brow, he confirmed: “Well, yes, I suppose that, in due course, I’ll learn how to work from a chair. It’s not the way I was trained but, well, beggars can’t be choosers.”\n“Come, come, Mr. Tal,” urged Hannah. “Don’t tell us you won’t be able to earn a living that way!”\n“It\u0026rsquo;ll slow me down!”\n“By how much?”\n“Quite a bit during the first few months!”\n“But, say, during the next five years?”\n“Perhaps 15 per cent?”\n“And over 10 years?”\n“Ten per cent or perhaps even less. I suppose I’ll get used to it.”\n“So a 10 per cent loss of future earnings over ten years is as much as we have to contemplate. As you are young and adjustable it might even be less than that!”\n“It might,” Omri conceded.\nSmoothing her gown over again, Hannah whispered to me: “O.K. on the earnings? Start on the dancing?”\n“Fine on the earning; but go slow on the dancing. He volunteered he’s not lost his hopes for the future. I smell a rat!”\n“Let’s see.” Drunk with the success of the last half hour, she turned back to the cowed Omri Tal. Like a matador brandishing his sword in the face of an exhausted bull, she got ready for the kill.\n“Let’s now turn to your alleged loss of enjoyment of life, Mr Tal. By all accounts you were a gifted amateur dancer!”\n“I was; and I could have ended right at the top.” Omri regained some of his spirit.\n“But there are no certainties?”\n“True; but my record speaks for itself!”\n“But could you have kept training as assiduously as needed while your practice developed?”\n“Dancing was first priority!” Lifting my head from my note pad, I spotted a smiling Boaz, who gave me a roguish wink when our eyes met.\n“So, your accident, regrettable as it has been, may have had a positive effect on your career!”\n“Man doesn’t live on bread alone!” was the pointed reply.\n“But it’s good to have plenty of it!”\n“I agree,” countered Omri, regaining the composure he had displayed during the examination-in- chief. “Sometimes I can’t concentrate on my work because I keep thinking of my lost dancing career!”\n“But isn’t time a great healer? Won’t you come to terms with life in time?”\n“I don’t think I ever will. I’ve tried to put my dancing career behind me. I’ve done my best to forget about it. I’ve really tried. But every time I watch others perform on the floor, I feel empty, hollow, out of place! I’m like a singer who lost his voice!” He had pronounced the last few words intently, fervently. I knew that Boaz’s skilful tutelage might have fine tuned Omri’s script. All the same, Omri’s sentiments carried conviction.\n“But despite your frustrations you go to your club once or twice a week?”\n“So as not to be cut off altogether!”\n“And let’s face it: you do dance!”\n“Only when we have social evenings; and only slow moving, old fashioned dances!”\n“But,” Hannah brandished one of Joseph Almog’s reports, “sometimes you keep going for two or even three hours.”\n“I do, although it ain’t easy!”\n“But how???”\n“I take pain killers on each occasion!”\n“Pain killers? Do you mean an aspirin?”\n“Something stronger than that,” muttered Omri, looking injured.\n“Like what?” intervened Baruch Shoham.\n“I take Petidin, You Honour,” confessed Omri.\n“Petidin,” Shoham was aghast. “That\u0026rsquo;s an opiate, Mr. Tal. How do you get access to that?”\n“My G.P., Dr. Levi, prescribes it!”\n“Your G.P.!?” Shoham was leaning over his desk, looking at the young man in the witness box with unconcealed concern and alarm. “What on earth is he up to? Petidin is a heavy-duty drug, to be taken on rare occasions when the patient experiences acute, uncontrollable, pain like in the early phase of a badly slipped disk! Petidin should not be prescribed regularly!”\n“I think this is why Dr. Levi gives me only enough for two days a week,” explained Omri. “He has refused, flatly, to give me any more or to increase the dosage.”\n“But why does he give it to you at all?” Shoham persevered. “Why doesn’t he prescribe something milder - less addictive?”\n“He tried; but it didn’t work.”\n“So why didn’t he tell you to stop dancing, at least for a while?”\n“We tried but I was getting terribly depressed. I couldn’t work or eat and didn’t even want to see my friends.”\n“Didn’t he send you to a psychiatrist?” Hannah stepped in adroitly.\n“Dr. Levi practises also as a psychiatrist,” said Omri lamely, whilst I bestowed an admiring glance on my friend Boaz who was smirking contentedly.\n“But then,” asked Hannah unthinkingly, “why doesn’t Dr. Levi prescribe medicines to help you to overcome your handicap at work?”\n“But, Frau Hod,” Baruch Shoham stepped in urbanely. “We\u0026rsquo;ve just been told that Dr. Levi prescribed the drug in moderation. I can tell you, from my own experience, how dangerous it is. I used it when my back gave way some four years ago. I needed Dr. Shaked’s help to kick it off before it was too late. Oh no – we don’t want our young generation to be turned into drug addicts.” Shuffling through his notes for a few seconds, he turned back to Omri Tal: “But, Mr Tal, why didn’t you mention the problem to Dr. Shaked.”\n“Actually, I did.”\n“You did? Oh yes \u0026hellip; so this explains Dr. Shaked’s reference to your having to use pain killers from time to time. Well, yes, I take the point. And you better ask Dr. Levi to refer you back to Dr Shaked for a further opinion about the medication. Two views are better than one!” Turning to Hannah, Baruch Shoham said: “But I really shouldn’t take the thunder out of your cross-examination. The floor is yours! Please do continue!”\nLooking forlorn, Hannah mechanically smoothed her gown over once again and looked at me anxiously. She was as deflated as Omri had appeared at the end of the first phase of her cross examination.\n“Get him to confirm he’s still looking forward to the future and ask about Be’er Sheva. We’ve got nothing to lose there,” I whispered.\n“Thanks,” she muttered and turned back to the self assured Omri who was purring contentedly.\n“Well, Mr Tal,” she said in a conciliatory tone, “but despite the regrettable accident you do have your hopes for the future.”\n“I do. I’ve already said so.”\n“So, your attitude to life has remained positive!”\n“It has; it has to be; if you don’t keep your head high everybody tramples all over you.”\n“So, in the long run, you will try to remain a valuable member of society?”\n“I shall indeed!”\n“And so the accident has not marred your hopes. It has not taken the joy of life away from you altogether?” asked Hannah.\n“It hasn’t,” conceded Omri readily.\n“And you are looking forward to your move to Be’er Sheva?”\n“I do!”\n“How about your departure from your club in Ramat Gan?” asked Hannah, whilst I caught my breath. The answer could, easily, turn the tables on us once again. Omri, though, remained positive: “We have already founded a new club in Be’er Sheva. I’ve been voted President and Chief Instructor.”\n“I am sure all of us wish you success and satisfaction!” congratulated Baruch Shoham.\n“I couldn’t agree more,” affirmed Hannah, back to her ebullient self. Taking in my gesture, she added: “No further questions, Your Honour.”\n“Any re-examination, Mr Tamir?” asked Shoham, giving the side that called the witness the chance to repair any damage done in the cross-examination.\n“None, Your Honour.”\n“Thank you Mr. Tal; you are excused,” said Baruch Shoham, indicating that Omri Tal’s ordeal was over.\n“This is the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s case,” announced Boaz, indicating he was not calling any further witnesses.\n“The defence is not calling witnesses” advised Hannah.\n“So you\u0026rsquo;ll have the last word. Well, it’s 12.45. So I suggest you, Mr. Tamir, address us when we reconvene after lunch.”\n“Actually,” said Hannah, “our firm waives the right to speak last in all accident cases we defend. So, if Your Honour pleases, I shall speak first.”\n“That’s very decent,” countered Boaz. “But, actually, Your Honour, the parties had earlier on considered asking you to suggest a settlement. As all the evidence is now on record, I wonder if this might perhaps be a good time?”\n“It would, rather,” agreed Hannah.\n“In that case, I suggest we reconvene in my Chambers at, say, 14.45. This will give the parties adequate time to get instructions and will enable me to go over my notes.”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/the-luck-of-valentino/part-11/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSome  three weeks after our conference with Keren, Hannah and I  marched over to our dilapidated court building.

Neither did he refer to his will. At our next reunion the sun was shining bright and the breeze was light and soothing. Shortly after I returned to Singapore I found a concise message on my answering machine. Lucy asked me to return her call as soon as possible.\nFor a while I stared apprehensively at the telephone. Snippets of conversations and fleeting images from my encounters with Peppi ran through my mind. When I sensed I was in control of myself, I picked up the receiver and dialled the number I had come to know so well.\n“Is it you, Cousin Peter?”\n“Yes, Lucy. When did it happen?”\n“He was dead when I went up with his morning coffee. And, you know, he was smiling.”\n“I’ll catch the evening flight.”\n“You might as well wait until tomorrow. Anna can’t make it till Monday. The funeral will be on Monday afternoon.”\nLondon was unnaturally quiet that morning. The taxi made excellent progress through the deserted streets. One might have thought that Heathrow was the airport of a sleepy town on the Arabian Peninsula.\n“You must be tired, Cousin Peter,” said Lucy as I came through the door.\n“I’m alright, honest. I slept a bit on the plane.”\n“Come, let’s have breakfast.”\nTo my own surprise, I was able to eat. The rashers of rosy bacon, the rich Bavarian rye bread and the slices of Swiss cheese cheered me up. Lucy watched me intently and, without even asking, kept my cup topped up with hot coffee.\n“He was a very old man, Peter’le,” she said gently when we had finished.\n“I know. And he had a good life. But, Lucy, I can’t bear the thought of it; I just can’t.”\n“You’ll have to come to terms with it,” she said, averting her eyes as I wiped my tears.\n“If he had only lasted just a little longer. I was due to come down in ten days. We were going to have a special lunch at Franz’s.”\n“I know. He too was counting the days. But, as you well know, it’s not up to us.”\n“True – and I’m being silly. I’m making it more difficult for you.”\n“Don’t you worry about me,” she smiled. “Women are far more down to earth than men. I’ve been preparing myself since he started to complain about his hip.”\n“Where is he now?”\n“They’ll bring the coffin over in the afternoon. A few months ago, Papa told me he wanted to go from home and pass by the shop. I’ve arranged a service in a nearby Roman Catholic church. As you know, he was brought up a Roman catholic.”\n“I am sure he would have liked that,” I told her.\n“You’d better have a rest now. You look exhausted.”\nI awoke to the shuffling of feet treading ponderously under a heavy load. By the time I came down, the coffin bearers were gone. Lucy was securing the door leading to the basement but left the lights on.\n“Feeling better?” she asked.\n“Yes.”\n“How about a cup of tea?”\nLucy made a pot of strong aromatic tea. She took hers with lemon and sugar and smiled wryly as I poured milk into my cup before filling it up.\n“Lucy,” I said as soon as she was settled in her chair. “I thought matters over during the flight. Look, I know how well you run the business. But could you do with an extra pair of hands?”\n“What’s on your mind, Cousin Peter?”\n“I’m fed up with teaching. I’ve been conducting the same courses for over thirty years! I can’t even dream up new jokes and anecdotes.”\n“Well?”\n“If you like, I’ll come over and give you a hand with the shop. I know nothing about manuscripts, tapestries and the other stuff you have. But I know my porcelain and prints; and I can learn!”\n“I thought you had something like this in mind, Peter’le. But how about Pat, your consultancies and your books?”\n“I’ve had a dry marriage for years, Lucy. I suspect Pat will be glad to see the last of me. And my consultancy, the opinion work, and my books, they’ve lost their attraction. Getting involved in the promotion of this shop, will give a new meaning and purpose to my life. And look, Lucy, between the two of us we can push the business to even greater heights. You have the customers and the \u0026hellip; suppliers. I too have contacts.”\n“We certainly have one supplier,” she said, and I saw a shudder pass through her. “It’s very kind of you. If I wanted to keep the business, you’d be welcome, that is if you still felt the same way after you got over your shock. But I have other plans!”\n“Other plans? Surely, you’re not thinking of giving up the shop?”\n“I am, rather. Actually, I’ve made up my mind.”\n“Lucy!”\n“Yes, Cousin Peter. I, too, crave a fresh start.”\n“But you’ve achieved so much!”\n“Haven’t you too? But that’s not stopping you.”\n“But I’m close to retirement. You, in contrast, are at the peak of your academic career. You’ve carved a niche for yourself. And the reputation of Theophil’s Antiques is second to none! Why do you want to throw all this away?”\n“Because I want to do something useful, Peter’le. The world is full of academics who care for nothing but their pet subjects, their writings and, if they have a heart, their students. And successful antiques dealers are ten a penny. I am fed up and tired – I’m plain disgusted – with my self-centred, covetous and miserly existence!”\n“What do you propose to do?”\n“I’m joining a hospital on the Ivory Coast as volunteer trainee nurse. It’s run by a Christian charity; and they need people.”\n“Has all this been settled?” I asked, downcast and bewildered. “When did you contact them?”\n“I met one of their nurses two years ago in Brittany. She had flown back to visit her aging mother. We spent some time together and she told me all about the institution. We have corresponded ever since. I promised to join when I was able to do so.”\n“When are you leaving?”\n“Pretty soon. Our friendly competitor, Jack Marx, wants to acquire the business. I expect to settle everything in two or three months.”\n“Why not put a manager in charge of the shop? Won’t you be sad to see it go?”\n“No, Peter’le. It has outlived its usefulness. Even if I remained in London, I’d dispose of it and move into full time academia.”\n“But why?”\n“I’ll give you just one reason – do you know who it’s named after?”\n“I believe I do,” I conceded.\n“I’m not one of his admirers, Cousin Peter.”\n“Hasn’t he been rather kind to you – assuming that he exists?”\n“Don’t tell me you are still in doubt!” her laughter eased the tension. “Haven’t you looked up our Friedrich Duval?”\n“I have made enquiries. A Doctor Friedrich Duval used to teach philosophy and theology in Göttingen.”\n“When?”\n“Around 1745. His nickname was ‘Fra Diablo’.”\n“And Doctor Theophilius, who directed my attention to the books I needed for my research, taught at Heidelberg in the middle of the seventeenth century. He was dreaded by young and old!”\n“But has he ever ill-treated anybody? My Fra Diablo appears to have been of a kindly disposition. His only faults were his piercing eyes, his ardent sobriety and an acid tongue!”\n“Then why did you look so diminished after your encounter with him?”\n“An irrational reaction, Lucy. Every time I look at my masked Boulevardier, I feel grateful to him and deeply ashamed of myself.”\n“Don’t. I’m telling you again: I wish to put all this behind me and do something for others; something unselfish and – yes – something good!”\n“I think I understand,” I said, forlorn. Then unexpectedly an alien voice murmured to me: “I do, too! But you, Peter’le, shall see me face to face before long.”\nWe had dinner in a salt beef joint in Piccadilly. Lucy savoured the Latkes while I enjoyed the pungent pickles. Just before we left, Lucy mentioned that Peppi had left me his porcelain, a set of prints and some paintings.\n“One is a rare Albigensian piece. I think I know who ‘sold’ it to him. You mustn’t refuse, Cousin Peter.”\n“I’ll cherish them, Lucy. One day you may want them!”\n“I won’t. They are yours; you might as well enjoy them to the full.”\n“You will, Peter’le,” said the alien voice.\nBack in Hampstead, I asked Lucy whether we should take turns or sit in vigil together throughout the night. To my surprise, she sought to dissuade me, suggesting that it would be better to get a decent rest.\n“But I can’t bear the thought of leaving him down there all on his own.”\n“I know. But sitting there in vigil in the dark cellar is inadvisable, Peter’le!”\n“But why?”\n“It could be dangerous.”\n“Dangerous? Lucy!”\n“Did Papa tell you the story of a certain event in Munich?”\n“Dad told me – long before I wandered into your shop.”\n“Yet you feel no apprehension?”\n“Peppi wouldn’t harm you or me or – come to think of it – anybody.”\n“But how about his \u0026hellip; supporter? He is the epitome of evil!”\n“I have seen no evidence of this – supposing I accept that he exists!”\n“Don’t be ridiculous, Cousin Peter: of course he exists. You have even talked to him. He is a tricky one – I don’t trust him.”\n“You talk like a religious fanatic, Lucy. I thought that, like Peppi, you were a free thinker – a rationalist. I used to think that, in this regard too, you were your father’s daughter.”\n“Don’t forget, Peter’le, that my mother was a devout believer. In this regard, I followed in her footsteps. This did not stop me from loving Papa and respecting him: he was my father, and a good one at that. In matters of religion, though, Anna and I adopted mother’s faith. So, you must understand my apprehension towards your plan to sit in wake over Peppi. His supporter – his alter ego – is unpredictable.”\n“All the same: my place tonight is down there – in the basement.”\n“Well spoken, Peter’le,” applauded the gentle, internal voice. Although Lucy could not hear him, she looked at me with concern. Finally, she gave way, dejected.\n“Alright then. But do yell if anything goes wrong. There’s no heating down there. All you can have is a sleeping bag and a few blankets. But please, please, leave the light on.”\nShortly thereafter, I settled into my makeshift bed in the basement. For a while my thoughts centred on Peppi. I had been deeply fond of him and had every intention of keeping my emotion alive. Then, as I luxuriated in the warmth of the well-padded sleeping bag, my eyelids closed.\nI awoke to the sound of a discreet cough. What I saw made me rub my eyes in disbelief.\n“Peppi, is it really you?”\n“I have not been blessed with a twin brother or alter ego,” he responded with a grin. As always, I looked at him with unconcealed affection. He wore one of his three-piece brown suits, a well ironed white shirt and a matching tie. Sitting there, on the edge of his coffin, he looked every inch the well-to-do member of the long extinct mid-European gentry.\n“I’ve turned on the heating, Peter’le. You’d better unzip your sleeping bag.”\n“I didn’t know there was a heater in the basement.”\n“Shall we say that I have attended to it. I command certain extra powers now, Peter’le.”\n“Thanks, Peppi,” I said, as I peeled off the blankets and slipped out of the sleeping bag. Moving a chair close to him, I sat down and held out my hand. His grip was as warm and as reassuring as ever.\n“You look well, Peppi. Just the way you did when we first met.”\n“Thanks. I could have appeared in an even earlier guise. But the apparition might have unsettled you.”\n“Strange,” I mused. “You address me in English. We used to converse in Otakring when we were alone.”\n“Would you eppes wollen speak Yiddish, or Hebrew?”\n“No thank you,” I protested. “English will do. Still, you never told me you were conversant in my People’s tongues.”\n“I am now, Peter’le. I am going through a state of transition.”\n“But you are still Peppi?!”\n“Guilty as charged,” he confirmed.\n“In that case, Peppi, I ought to give you a scolding!”\n“I’m terrified!” He raised his arms high in mock fear. “Still, it sounds imperative. So out with it, mon cher Pierre.”\n“Do you think, Peppi, it was right to leave us – just like that?”\n“Bad timing?”\n“Appalling! There was I, counting the days to my flight and – out of the blue – I got Lucy’s call. What was the great hurry, Peppi?”\n“Peter’le,” said Peppi, reverting to the Otakring slang. “It was bound to come sooner or later. I was, as you well know, ninety-four! Would you have wanted me to linger around endlessly, degenerating into a malfunctioning body with my mind gone – a geriatric monstrosity?”\n“No, Peppi,” I exclaimed. “That would have been ghastly.”\n“So be a Mensch, Peter’le, be sensible. Your Peppi enjoyed a long and excellent life. He came from nowhere, drifted about for fifty years and then rose from strength to strength. And his last few years were his best. True, he lost a daughter; but he found a son. No, Peter’le, Peppi’s time had come.”\n“I know,” I admitted, crestfallen. “But I can’t bear the thought of saying goodbye to him.”\n“You don’t have to! Peppi can materialise so long as you have the will to see him.”\n“Even if I am far away – back in Singapore or retired in Sydney?”\n“Such small distances do not count any longer. So, Peter’le, stop looking so glum. You are breaking my heart; and that won’t do!”\n“All right, Peppi. But it’s not easy for me to smile.”\n“Let me cheer you up, then.”\nFor the next hour Peppi recounted events from his long-gone youth. Dad figured in many of them. Some were recollections of tricks they had played on their schoolteachers, others related to adventures and misdeeds in the Prater, and others still to Peppi’s years in the army. Despite my anguish, I broke into peals of laughter.\n“Am glad to have amused you!” Peppi grinned from ear to ear. “But now, Peter’le, I’ve got to ask you to do me three favours.”\n“You know I’ll do anything for you if I can!”\n“Let’s start with the easiest. You, Peter’le, must not try to stop Lucy! Let her proceed as planned.”\n“But she is heading for the worst region in the lousiest place on earth. Don’t you love her any longer?”\n“What a silly question! You know I do. But it’s no good stopping her. She has set her heart on her \u0026hellip; sacrifice. Giving it up will break her. She has reached the point of no return.”\n“Will you \u0026hellip; at least \u0026hellip; persuade Theophil to \u0026hellip; you know what I mean?”\n“Poor Theophil, whose existence you stubbornly refuse to accept! Very well, I’ll have a word with him!”\n“Thanks.”\n“That’s settled then. Next: you must have lunch at Franz’s.”\n“That would be like going to a birthday party when there is no birthday kid.”\n“For the second time, Peter’le – don’t be ludicrous. Good old Franz went to no end of trouble to get the breast of veal from Innsbruck. And he spent hours perfecting the recipe for the low cholesterol stuffing. If you don’t turn up, he’ll think you don’t like his food!”\n“But sitting at our table without you … The food will have no taste, Peppi.”\n“Nonsense,” he countered spiritedly. “Just tell Franz to bring two glasses of wine and place one in front of my chair. Drink it to his good health in my name. And enjoy the new diabetic dessert he has dreamt up. I’ve tried it: it’s delicious!”\n“Will you be there?”\n“I shall; but I won’t materialise: Franz would have a fit if I did.”\n“And what is my third errand?”\n“It is a delicate task. You’ve got to find out why Anna cut me off!”\n“You mean you still don’t know?”\n“I’d prefer to hear it from her mouth. This way, there will no longer be room for doubt.”\n“I’ll do my best – but how? Shall I give her a good and proper scolding?”\n“That would be counterproductive. Anna sulks and clams up when you tell her off. She does not fear rows. Her weakness lies elsewhere. She likes to be liked. If she senses you think badly of her, she may try to explain. It’s her way of gaining your sympathy.”\n“Very well then. But I can only try.”\n“Of course. And now we have talked enough. You’d better have some rest. Slip back into your sleeping bag. I’ll have to turn the ‘heating’ off. Otherwise, Lucy will call the fire brigade in the morning or, if she suspects foul play, will arrange an exorcism!”\nLucy said little over breakfast. I knew something was on her mind but thought it best to wait. Eventually, she came out with it. Early in the morning Anna had rung to tell her she might be late for the funeral. Her daughter had succumbed to an attack of bronchitis with high fever. They had to wait for the physician.\n“What are you going to do?”\n“We’ll give her 30 or 40 minutes. If she hasn’t turned up by then, we’ll go ahead. I’ll leave the key to the house with the neighbours.”\nThe hearse arrived shortly after lunch. A number of people were already gathered in the church. Some were members and office bearers of Artiquar; others were antiques dealers who had done business with Peppi. Certain charities were also represented. Franz and his wife were sitting in one of the back rows. By 2.15 the church was full. By 2.30 it was overcrowded.\nThe traditional Roman Catholic service was followed by the priest’s balanced obituary. And still there was no sign of Anna. With a shrug of her shoulders, Lucy nodded. I watched sadly as the pallbearers – men younger and sturdier than myself – carried the heavy coffin back to the hearse. Whatever else you might think of Anna, you had to concede that she was consistent!\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-devil-in-munich/chapter-11/","summary":"\u003cp\u003ePeppi did not mention Anna again.

Indulgence and Old Songs For the next few minutes Pilkin and I watched as the waiter cleared the dishes and smartened the table by brushing the crumbs into a silver tray. After a quick glance at my host, who signified his approval with a nod, he uncorked another bottle of wine and then placed the dessert menu in front of us. Sighing, Pilkin ordered Zimmes, an East European sweet made of carrots. I knew he would have preferred a créme caramel but, after meat, a milk based dish was proscribed for four hours.\nKnowing my own heretical views about our dietary laws, Pilkin directed, peremptorily: “You just order what you like, Bushi: my first motto – circumstances permitting – is ‘tolerance’.”\n“I can’t take a sweet, Pilkin. But I’d like a cheese platter: if you really don’t mind!”\n“Of course I don’t! Go ahead!”\nAs soon as the waiter left with our orders, Pilkin observed it was time to celebrate and started singing. My heart was moved by the melodious Russian tunes with their Hebrew words and the popular army songs from the days of the resistance. Pilkin’s resonant Baritone reminded me of my of the old times. Somehow, the clock turned back and – once again – we were in a Kumsitz, sitting hunched like Indians around a fire, listening eagerly to melodies composed for this type of occasion.\nWhen Pilkin finished, I chimed in, notwithstanding my poor voice, with my favourite song, expressing the elation of a farmer who views the Kinereth, Lake Galilee, right at dawn from the height of a his horse driven cart, heavily loaded with fresh hay. Pilkin’s applause encouraged me to carry on with a song about young soldiers marching through the streets of Tel Aviv and a well known chanson about Samson’s Foxes.\n“So you haven’t forgotten,” said Pilkin when I finished.\n“I haven’t. I’m away but still there – the little man upon a stair!”\n“He wasn’t there again today,” Pilkin continued smilingly, “I wish he hadn’t gone away!”\n“Life or chance – or maybe Providence – makes its own plans for us!” I sighed.\n“It does. But enough of that! How about our Yiddish songs?”\n“Yiddish?” I was aghast. Although the aversion most young Israelis had felt for the Jewish Jargon had long evaporated from my system, I was concerned about the nature of our repertoire. Coming from a bunch of unruly young intellectuals, the songs were acceptable. But circumstances had changed since then. Pilkin had metamorphosed into a Rabbi and I had turned into a renowned expert on international commercial law.\nGrinning from ear to ear, Pilkin brushed my misgivings aside and offered to lead the way. I was still trying to cast a veto, when – without a change in his benign expression – he started to relate the deeds of the notorious Schlemiel, Rabbi Elimelech, whose clumsiness, inaptitude and absent minded demeanour wrought havoc amongst his hapless victims: the Schliemasels over whose trousers he poured his boiling soup, whom he knocked over as he rushed out of the lift when they tried to get in and whose rooms in the hotel he entered in the most awkward moments, confident he was back to his own quarters.\nPilkin had a perfect recall of the eight stanzas, recanting the hero’s adventures. Falling in line, I assumed the role of the chorus, chiming where appropriate the two lines ending with the memorable phrase: “En der Rebbe Elimelech, Oy Yoy Yoy”.\n“Your turn, Bushi,” commandeered Pilkin when he completed his performance. “Let’s hear Sara-Beyle!”\nThe very mention of the bawdy song made me sit upright. The song related to the endeavours of the spirited heroine, whose navel kept dancing with merriment. Notwithstanding the liberal outlook of Israelis, there was a taboo on the performance of the masterpiece in any decent or mixed society. Sara-Beyle fitted into the sombre setting of the Zermattschein like Jazz into a Gothic church.\n“Don’t be silly, Bushi,” insisted Pilkin. “If there’s any Yiddish speaker around, he’d enjoy it. And Goys [gentiles] wouldn’t know what it’s all about!”\n“Oh, very well,” I capitulated.\nWhen I finished, and mopped my brow with relief, Pilkin suggested we chant Belz, a song about a Stetl. As we were half way through, the waiter tip-toed in with our desserts. Curious about his reaction to the sight of two old men, carrying on like school boys, I stole a glance at his face from the corner of my eye. To my surprise, he appeared neither amused nor perplexed. Swaying to the sound of the sentimental tune, his face expressed a connoisseur’s brotherly sympathy.\nWhen we finished, both of us had to recover our breath. The abstract, inward looking expression, that descended on my friend’s face gave me the chance to observe him closely. His ruddy face, powerful frame and broad shoulders still denoted strength and determination. Here was a man who had come to terms with life and, in the process, emerged on top. He was not caught up in the twilight zone. The sober world to which he belonged gave him no cause for self doubts. His odyssey, I thought, had been unruly at the start but propelled him to calm waters as he continued on course. All the same, one detail was missing.\n2. Family Estrangement “Pilkin,” I spoke with some hesitation, “you have given me the news about all our old friends – even about that pain, Lupus – and also about Rachel, about your late mother and, of course, your family and yourself …”\n“What are you getting at …” he broke in, startled.\n“You didn’t say a word about your brother! And David and you were so close!”\n“Don’t talk to me about that swine,” snarled Pilkin, thunder written all over his face.\n“Pilkin!” I countered, shocked.\n“A swine: a stinker, a poz!” Pilkin went on vehemently.\n“I thought you were close, very close. And the way he looked after you when you had that heart attack. Goodness, Pilkin: he doted on you! What on earth happened?”\n“Very well, I’ll tell you. When David graduated from Mikveh [a tertiary school specialising in farming] he joined a Kibbutz near Haifa. After some two years, his present wife, Kate – a nice girl from Birmingham – went for a stint to the same Kibbutz. They fell in love with one another and so they got married. For a while they stayed put but then she wanted to go back to England. So they left and settled in a township near her family. David got a good job and so all seemed well. They bought a house in a good suburb and, after a few months, he was elected member of an uppish club in Birmingham. Eventually, they even ‘constituted’ him wine steward!”\n“What’s wrong with that?”\n“Nothing; except that when I came to visit the Schul in Birmingham, David asked me not to mention he was my brother. He was always a bit of a snob and so he didn’t want his club to know too much about his background!”\n“I don’t understand,” was all I could come up with.\n“Kate is an Anglican, Bushi. But she didn’t expect David to convert. She is far too nice and sensible to make such a demand. Yet David has gone into hiding, if you know what I mean. He doesn’t deny his origin; but he doesn’t boast of it either. I believe I could have come to terms with that. But the whole business took a different turn when he renounced me. That was filth – plain filth.”\n“Aren’t you being too sensitive?”\n“No Bushi: I am not. You know how I slaved to see David through. I did everything I could for him. If – after all that – he could disown me, I didn’t want to know him any longer! I wasn’t prepared to communicate with him like a fugitive!”\n“I understand. But – Pilkin – what would you have done if he had converted but without allowing his change of faith to affect his relationship with you?”\n“I would have had to accept that! A man’s religion is a matter for his own conscience. But that’s not what David did! He played a stupid and undignified game, pfui!”\n“Has there been a reconciliation?”\n“Kate engineered one when they came to visit friends in Israel. Yentl sided with her. So we are again on speaking terms. But I can’t forgive him, Bushi.”\n“Put it behind you, Pilkin,” I pleaded. “Snobbery is a weakness like any other. And it’s not like you to bear a grudge. Life is too short and David ain’t a bad chap. He was there when you needed him!”\n“That’s what I keep telling myself. Still, the episode has remained a thorn in my flesh. So that’s that!”\n“I understand. Still, as you yourself say, blood is thicker than water. And David is – and will always remain – your brother.”\n3. Reverting to Shosh For a while, Pilkin kept breathing hard. When, in due course, he suppressed his anger, I took the courage to ask him about Shosh. Breaking into a smile, he expressed his surprise I had not asked about her right at the start. It was not like me to forget a friend as close as her.\n“I simply didn’t want to risk hearing bad news about her!”\n“The Ostrich posture?”\n“True!”\n“Well, let me put your heart at ease. The news isn’t all bad!”\n“What d’you mean? There’s nothing wrong with her health?”\nGrinning slyly, Pilkin assured me there was nothing wrong with Shosh’s health. For all appearances, she was thriving. The trouble was at home. She had known for years that her husband was playing around but thought it best to close her eye. She felt certain he would not desert her, the children and their four grandchildren. She was, however, badly shaken when she discovered that her Uzi had a second household, with a girl half his age.\nHer initial reaction was to demand a divorce. Fortunately, she rang Pilkin before she went to see her lawyers. In the event, he managed to persuade her think the matter over and to discuss it with him, over lunch, after ten days.\n“When we met,” Pilkin told me, “she had simmered down. She was still annoyed but had realised that the talk about divorce and scandal was silly. So she settled on sweet revenge!”\n“At her age?”\n“Not that sort of ‘sweet revenge’. Shosh’s far too sensible to look for a lover. And I’m not sure she’d find one. She ain’t a dish any longer!”\n“So what was the big idea?”\n“Do you remember Shosh’s appetite?”\n“How could I forget that,” I muttered, recalling vividly how she used to have two or three scoops of ice cream when Pilkin and I had but one and how she used to gobble up at least one extra Pitah Falafel when we went out together. She had, also, found ways and means to get an extra helping at every Kumsitz and party.\n“For many years she made an effort to control her eating. She didn’t want to burst at the seams. Well, when we met she said she’d decided to drop all caution: she was going to eat to her heart’s delight,” Pilkin told me.\n“Not a good idea at our age!” I exclaimed.\n“I told her so. And d’you know what she said?”\n“What?”\n“She said she’d rather die happy on a full stomach than starve herself for the sake of appearances!”\n“Good old Shosh,” I let my enthusiasm show. “What a woman! And did she keep it up?”\n“You bet she did. Here – let me tell you about our last lunch, just two weeks ago!”\nTrying hard to appear objective, Pilkin told me how Shosh had devoured a five course meal and, in addition, had gobbled away most of his own, far less sumptuous dishes.\n“Poor Pilkin. You must have starved!”\n“I filled my stomach with bread rolls!”\n“I shudder to think what she looks like nowadays? A cube?”\n“A balloon, rather, Bushi. When I told her I was going to meet you, she asked me to give you her love. But she refused to send you a photo. Need I say any more?”\n“That’ll do. Shosh was always a piglet. But I’d hate to see what she looks like nowadays! Still, I hope she took a strong tea or coffee after that carnivorous lunch to help get all that stuff out her system.”\n“Did you say tea or coffee, Bushi?”\n“Well, yes; I did.”\n“You better get ready for a real shock. Yes, Shosh took a coffee – a coffee of a sort. She ordered an ‘ordinary black’ in a long glass, with a nip of Dom, two spoons of raw sugar and topped with whipped cream!”\n“After that meal? You are making it up!”\n“Shame on you! Rabbis don’t tell fibs, Bushi. And to finish the tale: when Shosh drained her cup of ‘coffee’, she smacked her lips and said it was so good she had to have a second!”\n“Good God,” was all I could bring out. The thought of her Einspänne, and of its seductive aroma, made my mouth water. During my visits to Vienna, in my Oxford days, I had often drunk such a coffee, albeit mixed with brandy rather than with Dom, in the coffee houses I used to visit with my late father. Such a coffee equalled a full meal, and was best consumed late in the afternoon over a newspaper or a weekly.\n“And she had two in one go?” I asked, trying to recover.\n“She did.” Pilkin assured me, with a twinkle in his eye.\n“And she smacked her lips thereafter!”\n“It’s a free country,” countered Pilkin.\n4. A Refreshing After Dinner Drink “So it is!” I agreed and, turning to the waiter who had just stepped in to attend to us, ordered an Einspänner, adding: “But with Kümmel, please!”\n“Hold on,” interrupted Pilkin, whose amused expression gave way to a look of brotherly concern. “Please use saccharine instead of sugar. And is there any good but not too sweet Liqueur?”\n“Well,” said the waiter after a moment’s contemplation; “the Kirsch is splendid this year. And may I suggest Pro-Sweet instead of saccharine? It doesn’t leave the metallic taste.”\n“That’ll do,” I said with relief.\n“And please use unsweetened whipped cream,” added Pilkin.\n“Very well,” said the waiter.\nWhen the rich, delicious drink arrived a few minutes later, I inserted the glass straw into the steaming coffee at the bottom of the long glass, mixed the Kirsch in, and took a sip through the snow white cream. Conscious of Pilkin envious glance, and feeling it was my turn for a spot of Schadenfreude, I smacked my lips appreciatively and, staring above Pilkin’s shoulder, pronounced: “A-Mechayedic.”\nInstantly, Pilkin’s eyes started to pop out of his head. Amongst gourmands like us, the Yiddish phrase, meaning ‘finger-licking-good’, was not uttered lightly. For a few moments he fought temptation. Then, with a shrug, he gave in.\n“Alphonse, I’ll have one too,” he said to the waiter whom, obviously, he had come to know quite well over the years.\n“After the goose?” The waiter, who must have become acquainted with Jewish traditions, was aghast.\n“The spirit is strong, Alphonse. But the flesh is weak. And if we don’t give in to temptation from time to time, there will be no sins left to be forgiven! Sinning – on rare occasions – is human!”\n“In that case, Rabbi Zohar, may I suggest you have a nip of Pflümlei instead of Kirsch? It is sweeter and just right this year. One spoon of brown sugar will do. And can I use sweetened cream?”\n“Go ahead. You are a virtuoso when it comes to drinks”.\n“Thanks, Rabbi Zohar. You are too kind!”\nPure delight was written over Pilkin’s face as he wiped his mouth after the first sip of the rich drink. “Delicious,” he confirmed. Grinning sheepishly at one another, we touched our glasses and Pilkin proclaimed, with the airs of a religious leader blessing his congregation: “To good old Shosh!”\n“Amen,” retorted I, enthusiastically.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/reunion-in-zermatt/chapter-11/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"1-indulgence-and-old-songs\"\u003e1. Indulgence and Old Songs\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the next few minutes Pilkin and I watched  as the waiter cleared the dishes and smartened the table by brushing the crumbs  into a silver tray. After a quick glance at my host, who signified his approval with a nod, he uncorked another bottle of wine and then placed the dessert menu in front of us. Sighing, Pilkin ordered Zimmes, an East European sweet made of carrots. I knew he would have preferred a créme caramel but, after  meat, a milk based dish  was proscribed for four hours.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Chapter 11: A Posh Kumsits"},{"content":"During my twenty years in Australasia, I had visited Singapore regularly. Adjusting to my new teaching environment was therefore an easy task. News about Ranjan trickled in mainly through Allen, who – unlike Marcus in Melbourne – was an avowed enemy. Marcus had, invariably, viewed Ranjan’s activities supportively. Allen underscored the seedy aspect of what he chose to tell me. He remained unabashed when, on one occasion, I gave vent to my resentment of his bias.\n“But surely,” I exclaimed when he mentioned some unbecoming political speeches Ranjan had delivered in a by-election “every politician has to play to the gallery!”\n“I suppose so,” Allen admitted reluctantly.\n“Why do you hate him so badly?” I asked. “All in all, he is just one of his party’s tools!”\n“He is the idol with feet of clay!” explained Allen after a short reflection.\n“An idol in politics – pfui!”\n“He was one of the very few – perhaps the only fellow – who could have injected justice into our politics. He lacked the vision, Peter; the vision and the conviction!”\n“Would anyone else have done better?”\n“Probably not; but that’s no excuse; he had the ability – and the background – but not the will!”\nI had to concede that Ranjan’s manoeuvrings left much to be desired. Even in his Oxford days, he had been glib and not easily abashed. Now, when he had turned into an ageing politician, he donned a suit of armour. Like medieval knights, he was invariably ready to hit back – even where a smile or a shrug would have done as well. Frequently, I felt sympathy for younger political aspirants, who chose to tackle him. Ranjan savaged them and, in addition, ensured they would not have a chance to enter the ring again.\nHis party, I knew, was losing its popularity. The savage treatment meted out to the Tamil minority was unpopular with many of the more enlightened Sinhalese. They realised the two communities had to live together. Controlling the minority was necessary and unavoidable. Humiliating these people persistently was unwise and counterproductive.\nIn the event, the growing hostility to the ruling party was expressed in a manner as savage as that party’s own acts. One morning, a trusted guard of the parliament house – where the cabinet held its policy meetings – threw a hand grenade when deliberations were in progress. Most cabinet members managed to duck but two were killed and some others – who were close to the site – were seriously injured. Ranjan was one of them. Fortunately, a nearby hospital saved his life by performing emergency surgery. But Ranjan’s spleen was in tatters and some of his entrails in shreds.\nAbout three months after the episode, Ranjan came to Singapore to get a second opinion on his state of health from one of Singapore’s leading medical lights. He talked about his ordeal over dinner. He had remained in ‘intensive care’ for more than ten days. He was lucky to have pulled through but, even at this stage, felt acute pain from time to time.\n“They wanted to keep my entrails outside my body – in a sort of glass box – for six weeks so as to see my progress. But I insisted they put them back and sew me up after four weeks!”\n“Why on earth did you take such a stupid risk? Suppose any organ had got septic?”\n“I had to take the risk, Peter. I was due for a rally. What would be the audience’s reaction if they saw me with my entrails in a container?”\n“Plain human sympathy,” I told him.\n“Don’t you kid yourself. They would have been appalled; and they would not have wanted an invalid as leader. They are plain folks, Peter: not starry eyed mid-European liberals!”\nFor a short while each of us was immersed in his thoughts. I was both impressed and flabbergasted by Ranjan’s determination and doggedness. He, in turn, was thinking of his ordeals and of the struggle ahead of him. I realised he had no illusions.\n“For God’s sake, Ranjan” I blurted out when the silence became awkward. “Why don’t you pull out now – before it’s too late. What is there in it for you? And remember – next time you may not be so lucky. Don’t you realise there could be a next time?”\n“There could very well be. Ours is a violent society. But it’s too late to change direction,” he said in a measured voice. “I have set my course and my targets; I won’t give up now. And, in any event, I face other risks if I quit.”\nThis was Ranjan’s first – quite direct – reference to the stranglehold exercised over him by his party. He had not discussed with me the acid throwing event. Ranjan, though, knew I was aware of it. He had always been able to read my face; and he realised I found the act unforgivable.\nWhen we walked out of the restaurant, Ranjan pressed his right hand firmly against his abdomen. I suspected he was in pain but would not talk about it. Next morning, he flew back to Sri Lanka.\nIn the ensuing months, Ranjan stayed put in Colombo. His postcard and short messages did not refer to his state of health. All in all, I suspected he was not as well as he had sought to pretend.\nRanjan did not advise me that he was coming over again. Then, one morning, my secretary left on my desk an envelope sent from Switzerland. I was, at that time expecting the half yearly statement of my own portfolio and so I tore it open. The first page of the lengthy document made me gasp. The total value of the assets was enormous. It was approximately one hundred times above the value of my own, quite substantial, holdings at the bank.\nA further glance at the discarded envelope revealed the source of my error. It was addressed to Ranjan Jeyaratne care of myself. As he had done from time to time in the past, Ranjan had arranged that the valuation be dispatched to him at my address. Sending it to Sri Lanka was too dangerous. He knew, of course, that both of us used the same Swiss bank – the very bank I had recommended in days gone by. Had I not expected my own statement, the envelope would have remained intact.\nCommon courtesy dictated discretion. I should have put the documents back in the envelope without going through them and handed the dispatch to the addressee. Curiosity, though, got the better of me; and the more I saw, the more interested I became.\nMost of the information set out details about securities. Ranjan had remained an active investor in shares and bonds and did well in his trading activities. There were, in addition, numerous credit entries, resulting from payments which – I felt certain – had been remitted by companies awarded lucrative contracts by Ranjan’s government. Such bonuses, though, were to be expected. What I had not anticipated were regular payments out of the account to bodies which were related to the Tamil Tigers. It confirmed that, like many other politicians, Ranjan paid protection money.\nSome credits too caught my eye. A neatly typed list attached to the portfolio revealed that most were made by Tamil individuals and firms. My first impression was that Ranjan was in the business of selling protection. I then noticed that these payments, each of which was of a relatively small amount, were made regularly; and most of them were remitted by banks in England, Australia and the United States. The bare facts were now staring in my face!\nRanjan’s state visit commenced a few days later. When the formal events were over, he came to my office. We spent some time on gossip. The subjects, though, differed from what they used to be in the old days. Births, marriages, divorces and developments in the personal careers of friends were no longer on the agenda. Retirements, old age sicknesses of friends and, alas, the demise of common acquaintances dominated our exchange of news. Eventually, though, Ranjan turned to the main topic. Had I received any correspondence meant for him?\n“Actually, I got your bank statement,” I told him. “But, by sheer chance, I expected my own one. So I opened the envelope.”\n“Did you go through the valuation?” he asked, as he took the documents.\n“I am afraid I did,” I admitted. “Curiosity got the better of me!”\n“You must have been surprised,” he observed, his eyes narrowing.\n“I was. And honestly, Ranjan, I hated the sight of that list – the supplementary one.”\n“You know what these payments are all about.”\n“The facts speak for themselves,” I told him, holding his eyes with mine. “Payments by Tamils who had escaped (probably with your help) but whose relatives still lived in Sri Lanka. Honestly, Ranjan, how could you? I can understand the commissions …”\n“You’ll find such skeletons in the cupboard of every politician,” he observed in a tight voice.\n“But those payments by these poor Tamils. No, Ranjan, I did not expect anything like that!”\n“What do you think motivated me?” he asked, trying hard to control his rising temper.\n“That’s what I can’t understand, Ranjan. You have always been frugal; and I’m sure you still are. You still live in the same plain family house. I’ll take a bet that that you still go to the same inexpensive eating places when you don’t entertain State guests. And that wristwatch of yours is as cheap as mine!”\n“60 dollars,” he grinned suddenly.\n“Mine was 75; you win by 15 bucks. But then why, Ranjan – why?!”\n“Don’t you know – you of all my friends?”\n“Tell me, please.”\nRanjan’s tirade covered old topics. His dream was to rebuild and upgrade Sri Lanka. The old tea-producing island was to be converted into a business hub, with industry, up-to-date tourist resorts, modern hotels, booming department stores and an active financial services sector, housing merchant- banks and private-banks. He wanted to give Colombo a face-lift, to develop Kandy and Nuwara Eliya and to make use of the sparsely populated regions in the south. It was an ideal place for safaris and for nature resorts populated by elephants. His dream was to turn Sri Lanka into a new paradise on earth.\n“What has all this got to do with the money?” I asked.\n“It will make my dreams come true; without the cash they are bound to remain mirages!”\n“Can’t the money be raised by the State?”\n“As I told you long ago: our people expect their politicians to be men of means; and to use their own resources to build up the country.”\n“And if you don’t make it to the top? You told me there were no certainties in politics!” I ventured.\n“There aren’t; but I’ve set my heart on getting there. And where there’s a will, there’s a way!”\n“I see,” I muttered, unable to hide my doubts.\n“Don’t you believe me?” he asked, perplexed.\n“I’m your friend, Ranjan,” I replied readily. “I do believe you’ve made your plans. But surely, what I believe or think is immaterial!”\n“So,what is relevant?” he let his irritation show. “You know very well that nobody can predict the future. But this ought not to stop us from making our plans; and you accept I have made mine!”\n“I do,” I nodded. “But then, Ranjan, how could you – you of all people – perpetrate these wrongs on the basis of plans which, as you have just conceded, may never come true? You asked me what was material. Very well: the answer is simple. Do you really believe in your own words and plan?”\nRanjan’s reaction showed that the barb – which had not been intended – found its mark. Gone was the smooth politician, the one-time President of the Oxford Union and the suave university don, with his endless array of jokes and gift of quick repartee when cornered. The blazing eyes and contorted face confronting me were those of the furious man, who had ambushed his wife’s lover and poured a can of vitriol in his face.\nI was too shocked to be frightened. I had, of course, known that the smooth exterior was Ranjan’s Jekyll: the benign Henry, who would not wilfully harm anybody. But I had not suspected that Ranjan’s Hyde was as ugly, as twisted and convoluted, as the vindictive mask of horror glaring at me.\n“That was a nasty thing to say, Peter” he exclaimed, when he found his voice.\n“No, Ranjan, it wasn’t; and it wasn’t personal either. It is my credo, my view about the façade put up by every one of us!”\n“What on earth are you talking about, Peter? You were always an obscurantist; a complex thinker without a sense of measure and reality. But this is too much – too much even for you!”\n“I disagree, Ranjan: care to hear me out?”\n“Go ahead” he muttered. He was not appeased, but his voice was no longer hoarse.\n“Everybody wears a mask, hiding his real face behind it, even from himself. The great philanthropist, the glorious social reformer, the ‘faith healer’ – don’t they all have a hidden side, often unknown to themselves?”\n“How about you then?” he sneered. He had, however, calmed down. Once again, I was in the company of Henry. Ranjan’s Hyde had move off stage.\n“Towards the end of my days in Monash,” I told him truthfully, “when I prepared my resume for the Singapore appointment, I realised I had been treading – noisily and persistently – on one and the same spot. It didn’t take me long to conclude I was a compliant traveller in a ship of fools. A work of Otto Dix drove the point home.”\n“Otto Dix – I never heard of him. Not one of your obscure artists?” he jeered, back to his friendly ambience.\n“Here it is: have a look!” I told him.\nRanjan looked with interest mingled with distaste at the drawing of the Crass Bertha, a woman nude but for a pair of silk stockings and a fashionable hat she was trying on while facing the mirror. Her sagging breasts and some wrinkles on her face told their tale.\n“An ageing prostitute doing her utmost to look desirable,” Ranjan spoke tightly. “She tries to convince herself that with this stupid hat she’ll solicit just as effectively as in the old days.”\n“That’s one way to put it,” I nodded. “What I see is a middle-aged woman, who knows her glorious youth is gone, yet tries to maintain her good-looks and dignity by putting on this ridiculous hat. What a tragic façade.”\n“I see. But, Peter, what has all of this got to do with the money I … amassed?”\nHe had raised the principal question: the central paradox. Carefully, seeking to avoid another avalanche, I told him that everybody I knew was seeking to bolster his image by wearing a hat. His own hoarding of a treasure was typical. A smart man like him was, of course, aware that his chances of putting the treasure to good use depended on the success of his political aspirations. Did he not know that their realisation was uncertain? How could he overlook that politics was a game of chance? Wasn’t he, too, hiding his head in the sand or under a hat?\n“Yes, I know the hazard of politics,” he responded readily, in a voice devoid of any trace of annoyance. “I am a realist, Peter: you know this.”\n“Did you then amass the fortune on a chance – perhaps an off-chance – of your dreams coming true?”\n“What else could have motivated me? You know perfectly well I’d never use the money for myself or even for my family. The provision for my loved ones comes from regular sources.”\n“I know that. But Ranjan, there could be another reason for the hoarding; but I’m not sure I ought to mention it.”\n“Go ahead,” he grinned. “I won’t lose my temper again; don’t you worry.”\n“Is it possible that you hoarded the money instinctively – because you couldn’t help yourself; because something inside spurred you on?” I asked.\n“Could be, Peter,” he retorted with unexpected calm. “You know something: it is the very question I keep asking myself; and I’ve pondered over it for years!”\n“And if something were to go wrong, the money would remain on the books of the bank, helping their Nibs to boost the funds of ‘investors’ shown in the bank’s books.”\n“Precisely,” he agreed with a shrug.\nThere was nothing more to be said. Our exchange of volleys had lifted the fog; and it had cleared the air. Ranjan’s money hoarding was compulsive, driving him the way it spurred others onto gambling. I too had been the victim of compulsion: it had driven me to acquire an endless array of mid-Europeans pieces of 18th century porcelain although my display cabinets were full to the brim. Like most people, both Ranjan and I were the slaves of impulses. Our acts were not explainable on a purely rational basis.\nEventually, Ranjan broke the silence by rising from his chair and indicating he was about to take his leave.\n“Here” he said, handing me the portfolio valuation that had caused the storm. “Please shred these pages; I don’t want to take them with me.”\nIt was, I knew, a gesture manifesting that – notwithstanding our short-lived quarrel – he continued to trust me. He was not parting as an enemy. As far as he was concerned, we were still friends.\n“And when shall I pick you up for our dinner?” I asked as we approached the door.\n“Actually, Peter, I am tired; and the old wounds still hurt. I’ll take a rain check, if you don’t mind. I do need a rest and a simple snack from ‘room service’.”\n“I understand,” I assured him, saddened and at the same time relieved. “But let me then see you to your car.”\nI could not help winking as the driver – an employee of one of the ministries – bowed respectfully as he held the door of the posh Mercedes open for his passenger. Ranjan slipped in, pressing his left hand against his abdomen. It was only then that I realised that his excuse was not a mere sham. Still, as the car was about to take the corner, Ranjan turned back, smiled and waved. For him, it was an unusual gesture. Usually, he did not look back once he had taken his leave. It dawned on me that, although we were still parting as friends, Ranjan had said ‘good bye’; not ‘au revoir’.\nLater that evening, after listening patiently to Pat’s complaints about having to prepare a meal at such a short notice, I slipped into my antiques room.\n“I am exhausted” I told Alfie, who looked at me sympathetically.\n“Your wife’s complaints?” he asked.\n“That too,” I told him. “But am used to this; have been for years!”\n“So why you so sad?”\n“Ranjan; I messed it up.”\n“Because you tell him truth?”\n“Perhaps did,” I fell in line with his use of our shorthand. “But was really truth? And why I tell him? What is point?”\n“You think better keep quiet?” asked Alfie.\nI knew what was on his mind. Throughout his life Alfie, my friend Tay Fung-Shuo, made a habit of keeping his own counsel. In his traditional, Chinese scholar’s outlook, the telling of home truths constituted bad manners. The only time to speak your mind is when a friend, who relies on your judgment, asks for your advice and guidance. I knew that in my position, he would have handed over a resealed envelope containing the statement, adding profuse apologies for having opened it by error. The storm would have been forestalled. All the same, Alfie’s demeanour did not manifest dissatisfaction with my handling of the situation. To the extent that I could read his expression, it denoted support.\n“Why you ask?” I countered. “You know you never open up like your friend Peter did!”\n“True; but perhaps you do right thing?”\n“Why you think so?” I asked, bewildered.\n“Men like us, Peter,” said Alfie, switching to plain English, “make a conscious effort to suppress their instincts in everyday situations. We consider it wrong to display anger, we avoid confrontation whenever possible and we do all we can to maintain our ‘dignity’. We look down on a fellow who has a ‘short fuse’; and we consider him uncivilised.”\n“Precisely,” I fell in line with his mode of speech. “But isn’t that as it ought to be? If everybody flew off the handle whenever provoked, life would become unbearable!”\n“Undoubtedly. But does this mean that instincts ought to be ignored or suppressed altogether? Have they no role to play?”\nHe had made his point. In situations of extremity – be they at work, at home or in our social contacts – our instincts provided good alarm bells. Our ultimate assessment of our fellows had to be undertaken by our own instincts; and by them alone. In extreme situation you had to follow the course prescribed by them.\n“I understand,” I told Alfie. “But why is all this relevant in this instance? Would it not have been better to keep my counsel and – plainly speaking – close my eyes. After all, none of it is my business?”\n“No, Mr. Mid-Yeast Tourist. I think you wrong,” he reverted shyly to our slang. “Ranjan, he your friend; close friend. You even talk about family, wives – everything. So I think his business also yours.”\n“And so close eyes; suppress instinct to tell; is not right …” I mumbled.\n“Not in such case!”\n“But he also know, Mr. Tay. I don’t think I tell him new thing. Like Englishmen say: I bring coals to Newcastle!”\n“No, my friend. You tell Ranjan you also know. You say, better not be so clever: other people not blind.”\n“This, I think, I tell him!”\n“Perhaps if you not do – you not good friend!”\nAs often before, he had hit the nail on its head. Like many smart humans, Ranjan had a low opinion of other people’s intelligence. He considered himself the one-eyed man – perhaps the seer – in the country of the blind. Our altercation alerted him to the fact that he was deceiving himself. His inner self – his egotistic, instinct controlled, alter ego – was not as elusive as he had led himself to believe.\n“Thank you, Mr Tay,” I said. “And you think you always tell truth to me. And I your friend; your very close friend.”\n“Only one time I do not; and I regret many years,” he replied sadly.\n“You mean, when I said I intended to marry Pat?” I reverted, instinctively, to plain English. “But on that occasion, common human civility prescribed silence.”\n“It did; and it was my easy way out. But your friend Ranjan spoke his mind, didn’t he? As you well know, I never liked him. But he is – has always been – your loyal and devoted friend; and you, in turn, had to be frank with him.”\nOn the surface, my relationship with Ranjan remained solid. Shortly after his visit, he sent me a Jewish New Year greetings card. I in turn sent him a humorous Christmas card. From time to time, we exchanged letters. But I did not see him again. Although he came to Singapore every few months on a business or state trip, he did not call on me. On two occasions he sent subordinates to pick up Swiss mail sent to him care of my address.\nAll in all, our friendship had not gone sour; but it had cooled off. On the one hand, this development grieved me. All my life, I had been a loner. My friends could be counted on the fingers of one hand; and Ranjan had been of them. On the other hand, I did not regret my having spoken my mind. If Ranjan could not take the truth, the fault lay at his door. If a friendship depended on camouflage, it fell short of a fellowship.\nRanjan’s career proceeded smoothly. He was appointed Vice-President, was generally regarded the heir and successor, and the polls indicated that his popularity remained on the up and up. I was, therefore, startled when unexpectedly Allen burst into my office and told me Ranjan had quit his party.\n“But why on earth would he do such a thing?”\n“He is getting impatient; and there are rumours of a rift with the President.”\n“Don’t tell me he crossed the floor?”\n“Of course not. In Sri Lankan politics that would be the end of his career; and the opposition would not want him!”\n“What did he do, then?”\n“Formed his own party. He intends to stand for the Presidency as an independent candidate!”\n“But wouldn’t this split the votes of the followers of the party in power?” I asked naively.\n“That’s his very idea,” said Allen in a tone used when one seeks to enlighten a dumb child.\nHis words made me see light. Ranjan’s design was simple. If he won, he would have stolen a march. If the incumbent came back – albeit with a diminished majority – Ranjan would have the time to lay plans for the next round. The opposition’s victory too would be helpful. Their incompetent leaders were bound to make a mess of everything. Ranjan would then be asked to rejoin his old party and would lead it to a landslide victory. In fact, Ranjan had opted for a “no lose” plan.\n“I can’t stand the fellow,” observed Allen. “But I raise my hat to him. He is an excellent campaigner.”\n“How about his party’s stranglehold? Won’t he be prosecuted for that old acid throwing incident? Surely, there is no period of limitation in the case of a major crime: a felony!”\n“Of course there isn’t. But all the eyewitnesses are dead or have left the country. How can he be convicted without evidence?”\n“How about the victim’s testimony?”\n“The poor chap is off his rocker.”\n“So Ranjan is practically immune,” I concluded.\n“He is; and he knows it!”\nFor the next few weeks I kept watching such of Ranjan’s rallies as were shown on international television stations. Although I could not follow his addresses – delivered in Sinhala – I was impressed by the enthusiastic reaction of the ever swelling crowd. It dawned on me that Ranjan was no longer the odd man out. His victory was now on the cards.\nI would have kept watching his progress but, by sheer chance, was appointed sole arbitrator in a complex dispute. The ensuing proceedings required my full attention. In consequence, I was restricted to the occasional news about Ranjan’s campaign displayed on the local media and to what Allen chose to tell me.\nThen, one afternoon when I was driving back to my home exhausted after a full day hearing, I switched on the radio so as to get the BBC news. The first few items – about unrests in African countries – were of no interest. So was the report about a serial killer apprehended in the United States. The next item gave me a start. Using his punctilious diction and polished accent, the announcer reported that one of Sri Lanka’s leading politicians and contenders for the Presidency, the Honourable Ranjan Jeyaratne, had been shot dead by a hired assassin. The gunman had made his escape but, apparently, was shot in the foot by one of the policemen in attendance at the rally.\nThe driver of an elegant BMW that overtook me gave me an angry look. I realised that my car must have swerved. To my relief, my apologetic gesture and smile appeased the driver. Nonchalantly, he shrugged his shoulders and waved his hand to indicate the incident was closed. For the rest of the way I drove gingerly, trying hard to concentrate on the road in front of me. When, eventually, I entered our front door, my wife’s expression told me that she too had listened to the news. Still, both of us thought it best not to refer to the subject during dinner.\nLater in the evening, I stole into my antiques room. For once, though, Alfie was irresponsive.\n“No, Mr. Mid-Yeast Tourist. This we not talk. Your great playwright, Ibsen, he make character in Peer Gynt say: ‘Hero not die before end of play’. So, my friend, if hero dead, it is the time for what you call curtains.”\n“And post mortem?” I queried.\n“Is no point: dead man is dead!” Noticing my brooding face, he added benignly: “I think we better talk about new Meissen piece you want buy; life, my friend, or what you call ‘the show’, it must go on.”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/a-candid-obituary/chapter-11/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eDuring my twenty years in Australasia, I had visited Singapore regularly.

He remained unabashed when, on one occasion, I gave vent to my resentment of his bias.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Chapter 11: Curtains"},{"content":"Who wrote Job? Some sages argue that the author was Moses.1 However, the vocabulary and syntax of the Pentateuch (also attributed to Moses) differ from Job’s. Further, Moses describes God as the very source of faith and justice [Deut. 32:5]. Moses would not feel the need to discuss the theodicy issue.\nOther sages,2 attribute Job to Jeremiah, who – as already pointed out – raised the theodicy issue [Jer. 12:1]. However, his query was not favoured with a reply and was not discussed by him any further. There can, of course, be no doubt about Jeremiah’s standing as a poet. All the same, Jeremiah’s main object was to deal with the issues of his era, namely, the corruption of Judah and the military superiority of Babylon. In addition, the dialectic approach of Job was alien to Judah of Jeremiah’s period (the sixth century BCE).\nGreenstein,3 concludes that the text was composed by a Jew residing in Yehud and suggests that the author was more conversant with Aramaic than with Hebrew. However, a Jewish Diaspora established itself in Damascus ever since the destruction of Samaria in 722 BCE.4 Indeed, Diaspora Jews came to Jerusalem after hearing of the destruction of the First Temple by the Babylonians.5 It is, thus, possible that the author was a Diaspora Jew, whose liturgical Hebrew was sparkling even if Aramaic was the language he spoke in his everyday dealings.\nAdmittedly, an identification of the author is speculative; but some clues about his personality are given in Job. To start with, the author is a scholar familiar with the dialectic approach to the examination of issues of ethics. He was, at the same time, a staunch believer in God’s greatness and in His having created the universe.6 He describes God as “…mighty in strength: who has hardened himself against him, and prospered?” [9:3-4].7 Thus, he believed that God’s wrath would impact transgressors. These words would not be uttered by a sceptic or a disbeliever. In reality, God’s Replies (caps. 38-42:1-6) do not militate against Job’s own creed.8\nAnother clue given to us is Job’s familiarity with the pyramids9 and his knowledge of the Egyptian wisdom writings and religion and his approach to the concept of She’ol, discussed earlier on.\nWas the author a priest? Probably, a member of the class would not utter Job’s reproaches and negative statements respecting God’s justice.10 It seems more likely that the author was a member of a non-priestly patrician family. It is probable that he travelled throughout the Levant.11 Herodotus, who lived in the 5th century BCE, was by no means the first voracious traveller. Ulysses of the Odyssey, who lived long before him, comes to mind. Sinuhe, the Egyptian, whose story was known as early as the 19th century BCE,12 escaped from Egypt and travelled to what is Lebanon today. Genesis narrates the travels of Abraham, Jacob and Joseph. It is believed that, like these characters, the author was a traveller and that he had eyewitness knowledge of the Levant.\nGreenstein13 concludes that he was a resident of Judah from Jerusalem. “Yehud” of the Persian period, covering the 5th and 4th centuries BCE was, however, underdeveloped.14 In contrast, there were sophisticated Jewish settlements in Damascus15 and – as demonstrated by the Book of Esther – in Shushan [Susa] and, of course, in Babylon.16\nThe author’s familiarity with astronomy – mentioned earlier on – suggests that he might have been a scion of the Jews exiled to Babylon with King Yehoyakhin in 597 BCE.17 Mesopotamia was renowned for its mastery of astrology. In contrast, astronomy and astrology were not practised in Judah or, later on, in Persian Yehud. 18\nSupport for the view that the author was a Diaspora Jew is derived from three arguments. First, Job is one of the very few books of the Old Testament that does not refer, directly or indirectly, to Judah or Jerusalem. Job and his three comrades come from other countries of the Near East and although Elihu’s lineage is Jewish, he is not stated to have lived in “Yehud” or Judah.\nSecondly, Job’s patent bitterness and his fierce arguments respecting the theodicy issue are more likely to have been the fruit of an exile’s bitterness than the utterances of one who returned to or lived in Yehud. A member of this second group would have been far more likely to sing the praise of the Almighty, who induced Cyrus the Great to sanction the return from the Babylonian exile.\nThirdly, the author is highly sophisticated and well read. He would appear to have been familiar with the wisdom literature of the Levant19 as well as with weather conditions uncommon in Jehudah but prevailing in region such as Assyria.\nGreenstein’s view20 that the book was, originally, meant for circulation amongst a limited circle of readers is supportable. This is especially so if the original version did not comprise Elihu’s speeches and God’s Replies from the Whirlwind. It is forcefully arguable that two separate members of this circle added these chapters. With their addition, Job did not militate against the creed of the day. When a council of sages, convened in Javneh in 90 CE, considered which books might have to be excluded from the MT, Job was not questioned.21\nBava Batra, p.14b\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nIbid., p. 15a.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nOp. cit., at p. xxvii.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nAnd note that the Book of Esther evidences the existence of a thriving Jewish Diaspora community during the 4th century b.c.

It turned out that the precedents in my hand were no longer needed. Jacob Keren’s secretary had gone back to the office to pick up a parcel she had left behind. With her assistance, they located the old precedents.\nAs I was no longer in a hurry, I decided to drop into David Misrachi’s eatery. I had been too nervous to take a proper lunch before the meeting. I was hungry but it was getting too late to have dinner before the show to which Rachel and I were going.\nThe popular lawyers’ haven was deserted at this time of day. It owner, David Mizrachi, who continued to serve on the tables, came over and asked me to have a Humus on the house. He had been forthcoming with such gestures ever since I came up with the name he bestowed on his establishment when its renovation was complete. But although an elegant poster described the place as The Lucky Lawyer’s Haven, the profession continued to use its old name. as David had not raised the prices, the establishment retained its popularity and appeal.\n“I’d love a Humus; thanks David. but please let me treat you to one.”\n“That’s very kind of you, Mr. Eli; but sorry: I’m not allowed to take it.”\n“Why?” I asked without thinking. “It’s the best Humus in town. why can’t you take it?”\nDavid brushed his bushy sideburns thoughtfully. “The doctor says I must not take it. I have diabetes and it is getting worse.” I gleaned that his affliction was of a long standing. The yellowish tinge of his skin suggested that some complications had started to plague him.\n“I sorry; really sorry, David. But can you have something else? I don’t know what you are allowed to take.”\n“Not a great deal, Mr. Eli. Sarah cooks plain food for: boiled fish and chicken; and vegetables. But I can have a cup of coffee if I take it without sugar.”\n“Please have one,” I pleaded. “I am celebrating: a big victory.”\nDavid Mizzrachi came back from the kitchen with two steaming cups of coffee. He placed the one with sugar in front of me and sipped, appreciatively, from his cup.\n“That big victory – is it Dahlia Nissim’s case?”\n“How do you know?”\n“Nathan Nissim was a good friend. Pity he died so young. From time-to-time Rivka and her daughters come to visit us. She told me all about the accident. She wanted to go to another lawyer, but I told her Mr. Keren was Nathan’s friend: so she better go to him.”\n“Well, we did what we could for her. And, David, Rotem paid. This is still a secret: so you must not tell.” I was taking a risk, but David Mizrachi was renowned for his discretion.\n“Enough for her treatment in America?”\n“Of course,” I confirmed. “Everybody including Rotem’s lawyers did their best to get things settled.”\n“Nobody likes an accident like this, Mr Eli. They all think about their children and family and hope nothing like this happens to them. This is not like an accident where a driver speeds and runs into a wall or something like this.”\n“And everybody had real sympathy for Dahlia,” I augmented. “Her boss sold his house in Herzlia and gave her some of the money.”\nTo get matters in focus, I told David what had transpired at the meeting. When I finished I asked him whether Dahlia’s personality and courage could have triggered off general sympathy.\n“It is possible, Mr. Eli. Everybody likes Dahlia. When she came over – I mean before the accident – all my children made a fuss over her. They loved her.”\n“Do you think she’ll remain like this. Won’t the accident, the operations, the pain and sufferings and the remaining handicap turn her into a bitter and unhappy person?”\nDavid Mizrachi weighed his words carefully. He concluded that Dahlia’s warmth and courage ought to enable her to retain her positive outlook on life. A strong spirit is not easily defeated. All in all, David was optimistic.\nHe smiled benignly when I took my leave. As I stepped out of the door, I saw dusk had set. For a moment I panicked. Rachel and I were going to the theatre.

Hannah left in a hurry, mumbling she had to report to Ruth Schwartz. Fearing David Mizrachi’s eatery would be crowded, I crossed the road to a nearby sandwiches and coffee bar. Munching away, I started to soliloquise about the events of the morning and about the legal fraternity.\nMy years with Jacob Keren’s firm convinced me that law and drama coincided mainly in films and in poorly written books. Undoubtedly, every trial had had its tense and often unpredictable moment. But I had never seen a witness crumbling in the box and coming up with a tearful confession. Most trials were less momentous than the Omri Tal case. Victory was secured by careful preparation, sound tactics and skilful arguments. On many occasions the final result was dictated by sheer luck.\nLawyers, too, were not the Olympian heroes portrayed by writers of fiction. By and large, lawyers fell into three groups. Just a handful were super stars. The bulk of the profession was comprised of practitioners reasonably competent in their chosen fields. The rest – fortunately a minority – slogged on notwithstanding their incompetence. Abraham Kadmon, who had had great expectations in his early days, was a case in point. Somehow, he managed to hang on despite the steadily increasing number of his failures in court. Generally, though, useless advocates like him were weeded out by the market when their disappointed clients turned elsewhere.\nA competent lawyer did not have to possess outstanding skills. His tools of trade were good memory cum concentration and the ability to assimilate facts and to comprehend and recall the contents of documents. Obviously, the craft of establishing rapport with court and with witnesses, the gift of repartee and the ability to think quickly on ones feet were valuable assets. By and large, though, these could be acquired in the course of practice. Colleagues, who had appeared hopeless in their first few cases, often became capable technicians as time passed by.\nFew of them, though, could rise any higher. Having observed most of the super stars of the older generation, I had come to realise that they were set apart from their fellow practitioners by qualities that could not be acquired by mere training or dedication. These comprised a robust constitution that enabled each of them to carry on when lesser mortals had long exhausted themselves, an uncanny ability to assess a situation effortlessly, an ability to analyse legal points and a vivid imagination. In addition, each of them had a special gift which was best described as his individual forté.\nDuring his years at the Bar, Ehood Morag had been admired for his unparalleled handling of subtle legal points. His sharp tongue, too, was a fine asset. Other lawyers feared its lashes. From amongst the current virtuosos, Jacob Keren excelled in tactical skills and meticulous planning. These enabled him to avoid traps and to place smart obstacles to hamper his opponents. Boaz Tamir’s boss, Israel Silver, could not match Jacob Keren on those fronts. But his masterful delivery and his presence of mind were often just as effective. I had seen him shrugging off bombshells which would have demolished any other lawyer. Silver used to come up with a convincing counter reply or move.\nI knew, that like most of my contemporaries, I was unlikely to become a courtroom star. My poor timing and tendency to get lost in my thoughts compounded my inadequate manoeuvring ability when on my feet. In time, I should develop into a competent lawyer; that, though, was my limit. Hannah, too, was not going to rise above the ranks. Her performance in the Omri Tal case underscored her faults. Boaz Tamir, in contrast, was a young man of promise. His masterly delivery, excellent rapport with the judge and his fine tactical skills should in due course compensate for his somewhat inadequate analytical ability and occasional lapses. With the help of reliable supporting staff he might, in due course, reach the same standard as his current employer.\nWiping my lips after I had drained my cup of coffee, my thoughts turned to the new leader of my team: Rachel Zeitlin. Instantly, my face brightened: in recent months she had become the centre of my life. I had been captivated by her trim figure, lush hair, self-assured manner and gift of repartee; and I was proud of our fine professional record. Out of the six cases we had handled since Jacob Keren pronounced us a team, we won five, including three Keren had described as hopeless. And we had settled the remaining one on favourable terms.\nWe had celebrated our latest victory in a fashionable restaurant in Jaffa. Rachel insisted on settling the bill, left a generous tip and, with a twinkle in her eye, observed it was high time she made a man out of me. She then drove us over to her comfortable flat on Nordau Boulevard.\n“A penny for your thoughts,” Boaz’ resonant voice interrupted my daydreaming.\n“I was reflecting on an old question, Boaz”, I answered readily. “What does it take to become a star lawyer?”\n“Luck, competence and above all perseverance.”\n“Luck and competence are essential; but is perseverance that important?”\n“It’s crucial, without it you sink.”\n“How about Hannah?”\n“She perseveres. But look at her performance this morning: she lacks judgment.”\n“And Rachel Zeitlin?” I asked, trying to sound casual.\n“I thought you were thinking of her,” grinned Boaz. “Your expression when you sat there all on your own told its tale. And, to your, question, Rachel will make it with you by her side; not on her own.”\n“Why?” I protested, blushing scarlet. “She is always in the lead!”\n“But without your pushing, she’d take things easy. Rachel likes her comforts. And, Eli, she’s not really good when it comes to legal points.”\n“Perhaps; but her delivery is brilliant, and she is not easily rattled.”\n“Quite,” agreed Boaz. “But she needs somebody to spur her on and be around when needed; and you love to work with her.”\n“How about yourself, Boaz; do you think you’ll make it to the top league?” I thought it best to change the subject. “I’m confident you can get there; but sometimes I’m not sure if that’s what you want.”\n“Spot on,” smiled Boaz. “And look here, Eli, how much respect and admiration do you feel for our super stars?”\n“They are great lawyers!”\n“But do you enjoy their company? Do you regard any one of them as a model member of our society?”\n“Perhaps not; but nobody’s perfect.”\n“True. But what’s the point in slogging it out for years, rising at 4 0’clock in the morning to get ready for your next appearance at 9.00 a.m. only to drop onto your bed, flat out, as soon as you get back home late at night? Is this the sort of life you aspire to?”\n“I won’t make it in any event. I’m not robust and my timing is poor. But you can make it.”\n“I made a few booboos today. I don’t know how I let that blasted Omri pull the wool over my eyes on the working method. I made a fool of myself!”\n“But you won’t make that mistake again. And it’s not as if today’s luminaries were good right from day one.”\n“True. Silver, you may be interested to know, likes to amuse us with stories of gaffs he made in his early cases.”\n“So, you see! And today your performance on the loss of enjoyment of life issue compensated. Actually, how did you work out that bit about the Petidin?”\n“I had a spot of luck there,” conceded Boaz. “Baruch Shoham’s bad back is common knowledge and I’ve spotted the pill bottles on his desk. I put two and two together.”\n“And the Dr Levi business? Did you send Omri to him?”\n“Off the record and between friends?”\n“Sure!”\n“Well, I met Levi in the army. He handled the case of a trooper of mine who busted his knee in training. Levi’s a fine doctor and knows how to relate to difficult patients. And like all GPs with an interest in psychiatry he’s a good man when you need some \u0026hellip; unorthodox arrow to your bow!”\n“Brilliant!”\n“But, still off the record, you suspected something was wrong?”\n“Still talking in confidence – so did Jacob Keren!”\n“But Hannah Hod refused to listen. She had to lead with her chin to prove she was Miss Know All. That – in a nutshell – is why she’ll never make it! But enough of that. We’ve got to talk about the case. Have you given any further thought to a settlement?”\n“You better have a word with Hannah.

I was struck by Anna’s appearance. The middle-aged woman who got up to meet us bore little resemblance to the charming little girl and vivacious teenager whose captivating smile livened up Peppi’s family album. I was put off by her severe expression, her firm mouth and her eyes – eyes devoid of mirth. Otto, in contrast, appeared friendly and well balanced and his eyes were warm.\n“I’m sorry we missed the service,” he said as he shook Lucy’s hand. “The doctor took his time, and Anna didn’t want to leave home before she knew all was well.”\n“I hope the service was well attended and that everything went smoothly. I take it our absence was not noticed,” interjected Anna.\n“The church was crowded, and everything was fine,” said Lucy. “Your absence wasn’t noticed. Few people knew that Papa had two daughters.”\nAnna swallowed hard. Otto opened his mouth to speak but changed his mind. I was lost for words. After an uncomfortable pause, Anna broke the silence. Stepping over to me, she held out her hand:\n“You must be Professor Berger. Lucy has told me a lot about you. I’m sorry we’ve not met before.”\n“The loss is mine,” I assured her, translating clumsily from English to German. “Peppi sometimes talked about you. So, you are not a stranger.”\n“You were very fond of him. I’m glad you were here so that Lucy wasn’t all on her own.”\n“Actually, I flew down from Singapore after Lucy rang to tell me. I had to say goodbye to him.”\n“Cousin Peter kept vigil by Papa’s coffin last night,” Lucy broke in.\n“By his coffin? Lucy, how could you let him?” Anna had paled perceptibly.\n“I tried to stop him. But he wouldn’t listen to me!”\n“Didn’t you warn him about Papa’s \u0026hellip; alliance?”\n“I know all about it, Anna,” I told her. “It started after a certain event in Munich.”\n“And weren’t you afraid to be there alone?”\n“Of course not. Why should Peppi, or whoever is behind him, wish to harm me? Actually, he cheered me up yesterday!” I had not intended to say the last words. The gentle voice I had heard before prompted me to utter them.\n“So he did appear to you last night. I came down to make sure all was well and heard you laughing your head off,” said Lucy.\n“Peppi told me some very funny anecdotes,” I said lamely.\n“Oh \u0026hellip; my God.” Anna was shaking. “He could have taken you with him, Peter!”\n“To what purpose, Anna? Don’t you realise I would have gladly gone with him if he had asked me?”\nAnna stared at me, nonplussed. Otto, to my surprise, looked at me with understanding.\n“You loved him, Professor Berger,” he said gently.\n“I did; and, as often before, talking to him gave me heart!”\n“What did you talk about?” he asked.\n“He told me anecdotes. But we conversed seriously about Lucy, about the Chef of his favourite restaurant in Chelsea and, well, about Anna.”\n“About me? What did he say?” Anna asked nervously.\n“He asked me to find out why you had cut him off, Anna,” I said openly.\n“Was he very upset?”\n“He was, rather. You, see, he never ceased to love you. He wanted to have you back; but – to use his own words – he wasn’t prepared to crawl.”\n“I see; and you were right all along, Otto. I wish I had listened to you!”\n“I told you the same thing,” said Lucy.\n“What on earth was it then?” I asked eagerly.\n“Shall I tell him?” Anna’s glance shifted from Otto to Lucy.\n“I think you’d better,” said Otto. Lucy just nodded.\n“Alright, then. The night it happened I had already gone to bed, but then realised I had forgotten to give Papa his good-night kiss. So, I went up silently – intending to surprise him. Well, when I opened the door quietly, Dad was taking a sip from that funny bottle of his. For a moment he was still Papa – my Papa \u0026hellip;”\n“\u0026hellip; and then?” I prompted as she stopped, too embarrassed to proceed.\n“A change came over him and – I know it sounds crazy – but he was no longer Papa. I was looking at the devil, Peter – the devil incarnate, with his red eyes and malicious grin.”\n“What happened?” I asked frantically.\n“I fled to Lucy’s room – too frightened to yell. She calmed me down. When we tiptoed back to the study, Papa was sitting at his desk. But he didn’t see us: his eyes were staring at some point far beyond us. I spent the rest of the night in Lucy’s bed. I didn’t dare go back to my own room.”\n“But don’t you realise it was a hallucination? I’ve seen Peppi drink from the same bottle. The stuff galvanised him: but he always remained Peppi.”\n“Don’t you think I tried to tell myself it had been a mirage – a trick of the light? But it was no use: I knew what I had seen.”\n“I understand. You were unable to dismiss it from your mind! But how did you feel about him after this?” I asked.\n“I was afraid of him.”\n“Didn’t you love him any longer?”\n“I did; but couldn’t overcome my fear!”\n“Poor Peppi,” I gave vent to my feelings. “All this suffering – produced by an illusion – a phantasmagoria.”\n“But was it an illusion, Peter?” asked Otto.\n“What else?”\n“Was your experience last night yet another illusion?”\n“Assessed on a rational plane – it had to be. My subconscious was playing tricks on me!”\n“Your subconscious could, undoubtedly, project Peppi. But how about the anecdotes. Had you heard all of them before?”\n“Not as far as I can recollect. Still, Dad might have told them to me when I was a boy; and I may have forgotten them.”\n“And is that the only rational explanation that comes to your mind?”\n“It is,” I conceded.\n“But then, aren’t you being dogmatic?”\n“How do you mean?”\n“I can see two possible explanations for last night’s events, Peter,” said Otto. He was still speaking gently, with no hint of anger or irritation. All the same, I sensed his fervour.\n“The rational and the irrational?” I asked.\n“You could call them that.”\n“What would you call them, Otto?”\n“The Freudian and the metaphysical: an unaccountable dream or a genuine appearance of the devil. Bearing in mind that you had no earlier recollection of some of the anecdotes, the second explanation appears the more likely one!”\n“But Otto – how can you, rationally, accept the existence of the devil? How can you rationally explain his willingness to manifest himself in such a manner?”\n“I have no need to resort to reason, Peter. Once you accept God, the metaphysical world need no longer be established by logical argumentation. It becomes part and parcel of your perception of the world!”\n“So how do you explain my having remained unharmed; and, come to think of it, how do you explain Peppi’s decency, goodness and humanity?”\n“My faith tells me that the devil has his own designs and motivations. I cannot and do not feel the need to explain or discern what he is up to. My duty is to give him a wide berth.”\n“Without grounds for accepting that he is evil – that he is out to get us?”\n“His malignity is pronounced by my faith. He is evil because he opposes God. I have no right – and feel no desire – to question this precept.”\n“Just as I, Otto, will not accept his existence, let alone his being an enemy, unless my mind, my intellect, drives me to this conclusion!”\n“For Otto, for Anna and for myself faith prevails over any precepts dictated by personal observations or reasoning,” interjected Lucy.\n“Just as you, Peter, regard your intellect as overriding any dogma seeking to prevail over it,” concluded Otto, speaking even more gently than before.\nThe argument went deep. To my relief, though, it had not created tension. We had tea together and, to diffuse the spirit of dissension, conversed about Peppi’s early days in Munich. We then turned to Otto’s work in Bremen and to my own life as a law teacher. Later on, when Anna returned all flustered from a telephone conversation with the friend who was looking after her sick child, Lucy suggested that they return home early the next morning. Before all of us retired, I mentioned to Anna the generous provisions made for them in Peppi’s will.\n“You mustn’t reject the bequest, Anna. You can’t deliver such a final, undeserved slap in his face.”\n“We can put the money to good use,” declared Otto in response to Anna’s questioning look.\n“I’m sure you can. I intend to do so with what he left me,” said Lucy warmly.\nNext day Anna and Otto flew back to Bremen. Lucy began to wind up her affairs. I had to attend to the packing and shipping to Singapore of the treasures left to me by Peppi. The only enjoyable event during this spell was a luncheon at Franz’s. Despite Peppi’s absence it went well.\nTwo days before my scheduled return to Singapore, Lucy decided to fly Munich to visit Helga’s grave. She urged me not to move to a hotel and mentioned, in passing, that she had decided to keep the house.\n“You will write to me regularly, Lucy?” I asked before she disappeared into the departures lounge.\n“As long as you reply punctually,” she chuckled.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-devil-in-munich/chapter-12/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAnna and Otto were waiting for us in the sitting room.

Bushi\u0026rsquo;s Analysis “Well, Bushi” said Pilkin when the glasses were empty, “it’s good to know that entre nous we’re still Bushi and Pilkin: never mind about that Professor Dr. Berger and the Rabbi Zohar stuff. So we have weathered the years! But now we have to turn to the awkward part of our reunion: the post mortem. You remember: we agreed to have it!”\n“So we did,” I nodded, “why don’t you start?”\n“No, Bushi: your work involves analysis – analysis of facts and cases. So it’s really your domain. I’ll step in if I’ve anything to add.”\n“Very well,” I agreed reluctantly. “To start with, Pilkin, both of us have done well but neither has set the Thames – or the Yarkon, if you please – on fire!”\n“Few have,” interposed Pilkin.\n“Quite! Apart from that, each of us has a positive balance on his score sheet. You have done well in your chosen vocation and, in addition, have become a real pater familias: and a happy one at that. I’ve done well professionally. In circles of banking lawyers my name is known. But I have failed miserably in my personal life. The less said about my marriage and home life the better. So – all in all – you have come out on top.”\n“How about the fact that my attainments are in-house – within the community – but you went from strength to strength in an alien society?”\n“But mine, too, is a narrow circle. And as regards your rise, Pilkin, remember: nobody is readily declared a prophet in his own town. So, in a sense, yours is the greater achievement. Also, Pilkin, my success – if we call it that – is transient. Within five years from my retirement all my writings will be obsolete. If I’m lucky, my name will survive in footnotes in the works of future banking lawyers.”\n“I shall be forgotten just as quickly; and without the honour of mentions in footnotes” grinned Pilkin. “But there is another side to our respective tales. You, Bushi, were trained as a lawyer and remained in the fold. I am a failed actor turned Rabbi!”\n“But is it as simple as that, Pilkin? I’ve been wondering about this all the evening.”\n“What d’you mean?”\n“Is your spiritual role really detached from your original vocation?”\n“D’you think I’m just acting a role?”\n“Not necessarily. But are you now a Boibrick [ultraorthodox]? Do you really believe, verbatim, in every point you preach: in every detail you expound during catechism?”\n“You know I don’t,” he conceded readily. “And I don’t accept the literal historicity of events related in the Bible. I haven’t forgotten what I picked up in TA.1 and at the University. But I do believe in the essential validity – and in the religious truth – of the message delivered to us in the scriptures. I always did.”\n“All the same, you have to … stretch … points when you prepare your addresses. You can’t, for instance, tell your congregation you doubt certain details – if not the very historicity – of the flood.”\n“Quite. But – you know – when I deliver my Drashe [sermon] I do believe in the truth of what I say: just as a good actor believes in the role he plays!”\n“Care to explain?”\n“A good actor, Bushi, identifies with his role. If the role does not appeal to him, he ought to avoid it. For instance, if you can’t accept Hamlet’s madness, you better give the role a miss. That, incidentally, is why so many actors play stereotypes: they can’t cope with other roles. Only the few great ones can make a success of almost any role. Lesser mortals have to find suitable ones. I, Bushi, was a good Tavyeh because I believed in him. I identified in him and actually became him. But I could not identify with Peer Gynt or Uncle Vania.”\n“I understand,” I nodded thoughtfully. “And, of course, a good court room advocate, too, acts a role. We discussed this before!”\n“How about a university professor?”\n“Same thing. I don’t really believe in all the crap – rules and exceptions – I often have to cover in a lectures. I know the law is fragile and transient. But I, too, have to play my part.”\n“So, in a sense, you play the role of the legal sage. I play the role of the religious oracle. The similarity lies in that both of us thrive on what we do. And we have the respective aptitudes and, of course, the necessary ‘faith’ in our respective calling and subject!”\n“That sums it up neatly,” I agreed readily. “You, Pilkin, could have been a great lawyer!”\n“I’d rather stick to what I know,” he retorted. But he smiled happily, cherishing the compliment.\n2. Momentums “Well, Bushi,” said Pilkin after a short pause in which both of reflected on what had transpired. “I’m afraid I’ll have to call it a day soon. I’ve got to leave early tomorrow morning.”\n“Sure. I’ll stay around for a short while. I need to let my head clear. But before you go – here’s a small token of appreciation. I hope you’ll like it!”\n“Thanks, Bushi,” said Pilkin, smiling broadly as he viewed the small package I brought with me. “Only I hope it’s alright if I don’t unwrap it now: it’s packed so neatly. But, please, tell me what’s in it.”\n“It’s a collection of short stories, published privately. There are only fifty copies. I hope you’ll enjoy reading them.”\n“What are they about?”\n“My life at the Bar in Tel Aviv and some stories from my days in Singapore, Wellington and Melbourne. The illustrations are by a good friend of mine: he rose to the occasion.”\n“Will you write a story about our reunion?”\n“You know I shall!”\n“Let me have a copy of the manuscript!”\n“Sure will,” I promised.\n“And here, Bushi, is a small gift for you,” said Pilkin and placed a small parcel, wrapped in gift paper, on the table. “It is hand-made, by a Bezalel craftsman whom I saw through when his wife ran away. Initially, when she left him, he was a broken reed. It took some time to nurse him back into sanity and equilibrium. When he was back on deck, he gave me a box containing three almost identical pieces and said he made them for me when he started to feel he was recovering. I’ve kept one, gave the second to Shosh when she had her crisis, and here’s the third, for you!”\n“But what is it?” I asked.\n“Please have a look at it tomorrow, after I’m gone. You’ll love it. And it will convey a message.”\n“Thanks,” I said, “I still love every Bezalel piece I have. Their silver work is exquisite!”\n“And this is special even for Bezalel. My friend is one of their top artists. And he put his heart and soul into the pieces he creates!”\nInserting the small parcel into my breast pocket, I shook my friend’s hand. “Take care of yourself, Pilkin!”\n“You too, Bushi!”\n“Till we meet again, then!”\n“Indeed,” he agreed.\n“Pilkin,” I stammered, suddenly out of control, “shall we perhaps schedule another – reunion? What do you think?”\n“At our age, Bushi? Don’t you think this might be pushing fate or – in your terms – taking a chance?”\n“True,” I conceded, sadly.\n“But don’t look so glum,” smiled Pilkin. “Now that we have met again we’ll be able to schedule meetings whenever we feel like it!”\n“Good.”\n“And now I must really go!”\nRising to his feet, he proceeded, without looking back, to the door. Despite his huge frame and broad shoulders he was – as he supported himself on his walking stick – just another old man striving to retain his dignity, his independence and his self esteem.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/reunion-in-zermatt/chapter-12/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"1-bushis-analysis\"\u003e1.

Initially, it was circulated to a limited circle of liberal intellectuals. To save this work from oblivion (that is, destruction or suppression) members of this group wrote chapters 32 to 37 (Elihu’s speeches) and 38 to 42:1-6 (God’s Replies from the Whirlwind). Chapter 28 was included by error when the MT version was compiled for wider circulation.\nIn its final version, Job was included in the MT. Admirers of the Old Testament are fortunate to have it. The epilogue [42:7-end] assures them that honest questioning is preferable to abject hypocrisy.\nTo sum up, the author of the original version was a wunderkind. His poetic caliber remains unparalelled. He employed dialectic analysis long before it was adopted in the Gemara. It is believed that he became familiar with dialectics due to Greek influence. The splendour of his poetry manifests his genius. Judaism was enriched by the preservation of the book.1\nThis paper is dedicated to the memory of my Biblical Studies Master in secondary school, “Old Frank”, who taught all his pupils how to analyze the Bible and love it.

It’s always easier to come up with a reasonable proposal after hearing the parties’ views. Needless to say, our discussion in this room is off the record and without prejudice. If no agreement is reached, I’ll listen to formal arguments.”\n“I discussed the subject with my Learned Colleague just before we resumed,” responded Hannah. “We made a firm offer of IL18,000. The plaintiff was prepared to take 26,000. But I think it’s only fair to say that, despite the substantial gap, both parties remained somewhat flexible.”\n“You mean there’s some leeway?”\n“Quite so, Judge,” affirmed Boaz.\n“That’ll do,” said Baruch Shoham. “As it happens, the figure I am about to propose is within the margin. But before I refer to it I want the parties to know how I arrived at it. You see, I was most impressed with the plaintiff’s positive attitude to life. It came across during the cross-examination about his working technique. Once the feasibility of working in a sitting posture was demonstrated to him, he confirmed he ought to be able to adjust. His main loss is the abrupt termination of his dancing career: he had put his heart and soul into to it and his great dreams were nipped in the bud. True, his approach to life remains positive: his forthcoming move to Be’er Sheva underscores the point. But, as he himself told us, man does not live on bread alone. And I sympathise. These considerations led me, originally, to contemplate an all-in figure of say IL23,000.”\nShoham stopped for a moment, took his breath, reflected and then went on. “My assessment underwent a change when I discussed the case over lunch with my Brother Ehood Morag. You will recall that, originally, the case had been assigned to him and so he was quite conversant with the facts. He is also an avid dancer. Accordingly, he has a special ability to identify with Omri Tal’s predicament. Well, you can gauge my surprise when Ehood Morag took the view that an amateur dancer’s career was usually short lived. Very few enthusiasts could keep up with their training. In addition, they found their professional career clashing with their hobby. Morag further said that, after a while, many amateurs started to find dancing somewhat boring. So Omri Tal’s accident resulted in an early termination of a hobby which might, in any event, have lost its spell sooner or later on different grounds. Moreover, Omri Tal had apparently solved his immediate problem by turning himself into a teacher and dancing instructor. In the circumstances, Ehood Morag opined that a settlement of some IL17,000 would be just and fair.”\nOnce again, Baruch Shoham broke off, collected his thoughts, leafed quickly through notes he had made during the lunch break and, then, summed up. “After careful consideration, I concluded that my Brother Morag took a rather hard line. Undoubtedly, like the rest of us, Omri Tal would one day have to come to terms with the wear and tear inflicted by time. Still, my own impression, based on the evidence, was that for the time being Omri Tal would have continued to regard his dancing hobby as a major commitment in his life. In consequence, I recommend a settlement of an all-in figure of IL21,000.00. May I suggest that Counsel discuss this proposal with their respective clients and come back to me. Shall we resume in 20 minutes?”\n“My client, Judge, has decided to accept,” affirmed Boaz when we resumed.\n“So does Rotem.”\n“So, the case is settled.” Shoham spoke with satisfaction and, addressing me, instructed: “Mr Berger, will you kindly draw up the agreement and submit the draft to Mr Tamir for approval. I’ll issue my order as soon as I’ve heard from the parties.”\nIt pleased me that Shoham, the ever tactful and considerate man, had remembered the importance of drawing junior lawyers into the fold by giving them some role to play. “Thank you, Judge,” I told him.\nWhen we left the chambers, Hannah shook Omri Tal’s hand and wished him all the best. Rising to the occasion and playing his part, the one time Valentino invited us to visit him in Be’er Sheva. To my surprise, he added with a twinkle in his eye: “And please give my warmest regards to Mr Shalom Cohen. We are looking forward to seeing him at our wedding.

Leaving the train at Notting Hill Gate, my feet soon led me to Theophil’s Antiques.\nLucy had concluded the negotiations forthwith. The new owners transferred the stock in trade to one of their shops and removed the furniture. The building, which was to be put on the market following refurbishment, looked desolate. Gone were the tapestries, the illuminated books, the silver, the glass and the porcelain displayed in the show windows. The vacant rooms and bare floors, visible through the panes, announced ‘empty’. The signboard alone bore witness to the fact that this barren shell had once housed one of London’s famed antiques stores.\nI looked at the building sadly. A chapter in my life had drawn to a close: a blissfully happy epoch of some ten years! My Peppi – the man of flesh and blood – had left this world. All the same, I knew that, as far as I was concerned, Peppi was still with me. His sound judgment in matters of mores and religion, his tolerance and his urbane outlook on life had left a lasting impression on me. They did so despite my suspicion – perhaps even knowledge – of the force behind Peppi. True, I still had my reservations about the existence of that force or being. All the same, I had sensed it and respected it from afar from my early childhood. Now, at long last, I was prepared to commit myself to it. But would that being – be it Theophil or Peppi’s spirit – give me the chance?\nDowncast, I turned away from the shop, but at the last moment spotted a piece of paper protruding from beneath the front door. Instinctively, I approached and bent down to pick it up. In the process I brushed against the door. To my surprise, it gave way.\nA sense of unreality, of trepidation, engulfed me as I entered. Dropping my umbrella into a stand that had been left behind, I walked slowly from room to room. Satisfied that the movers had done a conscientious job, I took the stairs leading to the second storey and, ignoring the chime of an inner warning bell, tried the handle of Peppi’s office. The door opened noiselessly. I stepped inside, my heart racing.\nPeppi’s elegant desk and well-upholstered armchair were still in their place, as, indeed, was the visitor’s chair which I had occupied so many times since we had met. Without further thought I took my seat, rested my tired feet, and – just for a moment – closed my eyes.\nWhen I opened them, Peppi was sitting across from me. He looked distinguished in the fine two-piece light blue suit, custom made by a tailor in Savile Row.\n“You look great, Peppi. Thanks for the treasures you left me. I’ll cherish them.”\n“I know. They’ll go well with some I gave you … under a different guise,” he replied, shaking my hand warmly. “And Peter’le, thanks for the information you got from Anna. Her encounter triggered off her metamorphosing from a light-hearted adolescent into a seriously minded young woman.”\n“Did all this make sense to you?”\n“Now, when all is clear, it does,” he nodded.\n“But how could you – or Theophil – let this happen?”\n“I had forgotten to lock the door. Poor Theophil – whom everybody blames for all wrongs in the Galaxy – is not always in command!”\n“I am still baffled. I saw you taking hearty swigs from the same bottle. It’s true that a change came over you. Yet you remained Peppi!”\n“But Peter’le, truth is in the eye of the beholder. You are a hardened rationalist. Even if you had witnessed a total change, you would have dismissed it from your \u0026hellip; prejudiced \u0026hellip; mind. Anna was in her teens – a mere child – and so she believed her eyes.”\n“Anna’s hysterical reaction was underscored by the vicissitudes of puberty and of growing up,” I added. “Still, Peppi, I maintain that on all these occasions you remained yourself!”\n“Except at the very moment contact was made. For just a second there was a sort of a \u0026hellip; transition. If young Anna had arrived a minute later, she would have beheld her loving father, would have crept up behind him and yelled ‘boo’ in his ear, given him a kiss and returned triumphantly to her own bed!”\n“What an unfortunate coincidence.”\n“It was, rather. But even great events can be triggered by trivial causes!”\nFor a while we sat lost in thought. I was pondering on the unhappiness and suffering that a single moment had inflicted on my friend and on his daughter. Peppi, I sensed, was reflecting on the events of the last few days. In the end, it was I who broke the silence.\n“Peppi, what is your reaction to Otto’s simplistic explanation of ‘good’ and ‘evil’?” I asked with some hesitation.\n“It is dictated by his faith. Further, as an exercise in consistency, it is impressive.”\n“Many years ago, in Munich, Theophil convinced Dad that ‘good’ and ‘evil’ were separated by a narrow, perhaps imperceptible, line! Well, Peppi, don’t you think the distinction is altogether illusory? The terms are relative. What is ‘good’ today may be ‘evil’ tomorrow. Further, what is ‘good’ for Tom may spell ‘evil’ for Dick and Harry.”\n“Would you care to elaborate?” he asked with growing interest.\n“How about King Sha’ul? His failure to annihilate the Amalekite women and children strikes me as decent and humane. But the poor chap lost his Kingdom for this purportedly horrid crime!”\n“What would Otto’s reply be?”\n“What the Bible says: disobedience is a sin, as is the very questioning of a divine command!”\n“And your conclusion, Peter’le?”\n“Both ‘good’ and ‘evil’ are relative terms. ‘Purposive’ [or utilitarian] and ‘counter-purposive’ are more to the point. The former engulfs anything that furthers a goal. The latter is anything that stands in its way. Let me illustrate the point: even love, when take to extremes, might become a prison. In most cases, passion fades, doesn’t it? This means that what begins as a passionate fire between husband and wife cools to ashes unless companionship and understanding replace it. Often this metamorphosis does not take place. Accordingly, what started as ‘good’ might turn to something undesirable and hence ‘counter-purposive’!”\n“I agree. And how about Otto’s further conclusion that the Devil is ‘evil’ because he casts doubt on the goodness and omnipotence of the Good Lord, who is deemed the epitome of all that is ‘good’?”\n“Except that, like the Devil, a rationalist is bound to question both the ‘goodness’ and the ‘omnipotence’ of the Good Lord.”\n“Why?” asked Peppi.\n“Because a rationalist refuses to accept a principle or rule without proof!”\n“But Peter’le, who taught Rationalist Man to take such an assertive stand?”\n“We know the answer; that is, if Mephisto exists.”\n“You remain unconvinced,” he grinned.\n“Why can’t he simply appear in front of me?!”\n“Didn’t he speak to you?” For just a second Peppi let his irritation show. Then, in a milder tone, he added: “You, Peter’le, believe your eyes but doubt your ears. Still, will you be able to face him if he materialises in front of you?”\n“Of course!” I let my own irritation show.\n“Very well then. But, whatever happens, do not break our eye contact.”\nEven as he spoke, a subtle change came over him. Initially, he remained Peppi as affected by a sip from his bottle. Then his face mutated, becoming elongated with protruding cheekbones and a firmly set chin. At the same time, the colour of his pupils and of his skin altered, assuming a reddish tinge; and his hands, arms and neck became sinewy, leathery. His figure, too, mutated from Peppi’s bulk to Friedrich Duval’s gaunt physique.\nAs this metamorphosis took place, my heartbeat grew faster and faster. As it progressed, I was overcome by waves of panic. My hands shook, my jaw tightened and beads of sweat formed on my brow. My mouth opened wide, but a remnant of sanity, abetted by pride, suppressed my scream of terror. Then, gradually, reason returned. My breath steadied, my hands regained their strength and the black circles in front of my eyes vanished.\n“So, we have braved this storm, Peter’le,” Theophil spoke gently, affectionately.\n“The voice is still the voice of Peppi but the shape is Friedrich Duval’s,” I said, surprised that my words were not hindered by a stammer.\n“What a clever adaptation of Genesis 27:22,” he smiled benevolently.\n“Peppi would not recognise the verse,” I countered, my gaze holding his. “And you are Mephisto, known to me as Theophil!”\n“Who else, old friend?”\n“It is you who under different guises has befriended me over the years. And during my ten years of friendship with Peppi, I formed a bond with him and tightened the commitment to you.”\n“So you did; and you befriended him although you sensed, perhaps even knew, that the force behind Peppi was Theophil!”\n“I sensed it. But I didn’t comprehend! But, you know, I owe you an apology,” I told him.\n“Not for doubting my existence? You were quite rational there – even if perversely so. Still, dogma dies hard. But me’thinks you are contrite for yet some other reason.”\n“I am ashamed of my idiotic reaction. Why on earth did I turn into a terrified child!”\n“Your reaction was natural, or ‘as anticipated’. All in all, you under-reacted!”\n“I thought I did the opposite. Looking rationally at what had happened, I fail to see what frightened me.”\n“But is fear rational?”\n“Fear is an instinctive reaction to danger: an in-built safeguard or warning device. But how does this explain my reaction to you? What made my nerves classify you as a threat? There is no ‘past experience’ to justify their reaction.”\n“Simply put: your nerves treat the ‘unknown’ as dangerous. The precise answer is more complex. The human race is programmed to fear me because I am ‘evil’.”\n“A genetic instinct?”\n“Many instincts are! Fear of the dark is one. Fear of sudden change is another. You can call these instincts the human ‘self-preservation mechanism’. My presence induces Man to question his basic dogmas. Your instincts protect you against this ‘evil’ influence.”\n“I understand; and you have to find ways to deal with this fear when you visit us in person.”\n“Often.”\n“Is why you are called ‘tricky’?”\n“Precisely – and don’t you fear. I was not offended by our fair Lucy’s words. She spoke as programmed. She represents the human norm. You, with your incessant urge to question, are the exception. This is why I’ve been able to reveal myself to you without catastrophic repercussions.”\n“Thank you,” I said, gratified by the implicit compliment.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-devil-in-munich/chapter-13/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eOn my last day in London, I had an early breakfast and, following a pleasant stroll on Hampstead Heath, decided to have a last browse in Kensington Church Street. Leaving the train at Notting Hill Gate, my feet soon led me to Theophil’s Antiques.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucy had concluded the negotiations forthwith. The new owners transferred the stock in trade to one of their shops and removed the furniture. The building, which was to be put on the market following refurbishment, looked desolate. Gone were the tapestries, the illuminated books, the silver, the glass and the porcelain displayed in the show windows. The vacant rooms and bare floors, visible through the panes, announced ‘empty’. The signboard alone bore witness to the fact that this barren shell had once housed one of London’s famed antiques stores.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Chapter 13: Theophil's Outlook"},{"content":"Next morning I packed my suitcase, went for a walk and then had a light breakfast. When I stepped back into the lobby, the receptionist told me the room facing the Matterhorn was ready. After I settled in it, I took Pilkin’s gift out of the spacious pocket of my parka. Was it a paper knife or some other small Bezalel artefact? First to be revealed was a fine chamois sachet. Inside it was a velvet sheath, neatly tied with a maroon lace. When I opened it, my hand started to tremble. I was holding in my hand an exquisite religious object, delicately crafted in silver: a Mezuzah, traditionally mounted on the door post of Jewish homes in remembrance of the Exodus myth. Smilingly, I recalled the Mezuzah that had been displayed on front door of my parents’ home in Tel Aviv. It, too, was a fine piece, but not of the same quality as the work of art I admired this morning.\nWhat – I asked myself – did Pilkin intend to convey through it? Did he mean to tell me that, wherever I turned, I had remained one of the fold? Even as the thought crossed my mind, I realised that Pilkin would not seek to acquaint me with such a basic truth. A sophisticated, worldly, man like him would know that I, too, was aware of this fundamental fact of life. He would also have realised that, if I had sought to sever my links with the past, I should not have kept our rendezvous. Could he, nevertheless, have wished to underscore the existence of the link – driving its existence home in the manner of one preaching to the converted? Grinning inwardly, I rejected the notion. Such a banal ruse was out of Pilkin’s character.\nWhat then was the hidden message attached to his generous gift? Closing my eyes, I let my fingers run along the lines of its articulately engraved pattern. Far from breaking into precise geometrical forms, they wound around an axis, imperceptible to the eye, spraying in places into loops arranged in a capricious design. I sensed that the hand that shaped these fine embossed lines had been guided by a keen eye and an inwardly focused glance. The artist had viewed his emerging masterpiece even as he was forming it with his unerring hand. He, too, sought to convey a thought, perhaps even a credo, through it.\nOpening my eyes, I experienced a strange sensation. A few minutes earlier, when I had slumped into the armchair in my room, my heart had been pounding with trepidation mingled with anticipation. I had been edgy and restless. Now that sense of unease, of disharmony, had evaporated. It had given way to a welcome feeling of inner piece and calm: a rare sensation in my turbulent life. I was in harmony with the world around and with myself.\nHad the Mezuzah, an artefact without a life or soul of its own, triggered off this reaction? Did it have the effect of a tranquilliser? As my eye travelled along the skilfully grafted petals of the Mezuzah and its intertwined configurations, I wondered why did a message enshrined in an artefact affect me? I had never met the Bezalel artist. In a way, though, the tragic experiences that spurred him on when he crafted the piece were common to mankind. From times immemorial, life proceeded along endless grooves. Anyone could have a fall as he wound his way through one of them.\nThe message conveyed by the Bezalel craftsman – a message forged out of pain and sufferings, out of misery and longings – was loud and clear. Somewhere along the path you traversed, as the blizzard disrupted your comfortable routine, you had to rekindle your strength by looking deep into your own soul to find the way back to light. Once you had spotted the nearest petal en route, you had to grab it and pull yourself up by holding on to it. More often than not, that petal was your own survival instinct but, occasionally, it turned out to be the willing support – the ready shoulder – of a real friend. He alone could and would step in when needed. And he would not do so for gain, not even with the hope of being rewarded with words of thanks, but, simply, because you were friends.\nThis, I felt certain, was the message of the Bezalel artist and of my friend Pilkin! For a while, I continued to admire Pilkin’s gift. Then I placed it back in its protective wraps and hid the parcel in the small safe in my room.\nHaving put on my parka, I closed the window and went out. “Did you have a pleasant dinner, Herr Professor,” asked the receptionist as I dropped my key on her desk.\n“Outstanding,” I assured her.\n“I am delighted! And what are you doing today?”\n“I’m taking the chair lift well above Furi.”\n“It’ll be lovely up there today; but the air is very thin!”\n“I won’t go too high up. And thanks for warning” I smiled at her. “And I hope you have a nice day down here.”\n“It should be: it’s my last day in Zermatt.” “Your last day?”\n“Well, yes: my fiancé wants to open a restaurant in Kufstein; and so we’re getting married!”\n“Congratulations! So you’re going back to Austria?”\n“Yes! I’m from St. Anton – in Tyrol, you know; and it’s time to go home!”\n“All the best to you then; all the very best!”\n“Thanks,” she beamed; “and you, take care of yourself!”\n“I’ll sure try,” I affirmed.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/reunion-in-zermatt/chapter-13/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eNext morning I packed my suitcase, went for a walk and then had a light breakfast.

Boaz and I spent some time drafting the settlement document and then walked back together, wadding our way through the thin, aggravating, drizzle. As if by agreement, we dropped into David Mizrachi’s eatery. Lunch time was long over but both of us felt the need for a cup of his strong brewed aromatic coffee.\n“What was that odd crack about Shalom Cohen?” I asked as I wiped the raindrops off my face. “I didn’t know Hannah and Omri had common friends?”\n“He meant Joseph Almog,” grinned Boaz. “Shalom Cohen was the nom-de-plume Almog used for this job!”\n“How did you identify him?”\n“Originally, when Almog became so friendly, Omri suspected he was after his girl. But when Almog kept snooping about the effects of the accident, Omri had second thoughts. When the telephone book yielded no information about a Shalom Cohen at the given address, Omri showed me the photos taken at the engagement party. Well, Eli, we too use Mr Joseph Almog from time to time!”\n“And didn’t you use Almog to feed us a line?” I muttered.\n“Perish the thought,” grinned Boaz. “What do you think we are? No, Eli, shall we say that we edited some information for your benefit!”\n“You mean, selectively edited,” I grumbled.\n“Let’s not split hair. Wouldn’t your Jacob Keren love to do the same to us?”\n“Wouldn’t he ever. All in all, Boaz, I have to say: well done; very cool indeed!”\n“That’s better. Our case went on so smoothly until you had these two breaks this morning!”\n“Two?”\n“Precisely; to start with, my idiot of a client tried to be clever about some facts. Still, we braved that storm thanks to help from the benign Frau Hod. But then came Shoham\u0026rsquo;s ‘informal chat’ with Ehood Morag. That, Eli, did it!”\n“And to think Keren wanted to get Morag off the case!” I observed.\n“For once your boss was out of touch. Ehood Morag’s views about dancing changed radically when his charming Varda said goodbye!”\n“When did this happen?”\n“A few weeks before we took out our writ in the Omri Tal case. Morag’s wife was disenchanted when they failed to win back the Waltz trophy. She eloped with the current Waltz King!”\n“What???”\n“You see, that chap’s dancing partner was his own sister. When she migrated to New York, he started to make eyes at Varda; and she succumbed!”\n“Just because of the waltzing? What a bitch!”\n“No, Eli; you mustn’t say that. Varda’s a good friend of Miri. For years Varda suffered patiently all of Ehood’s nonsense: his long lapses into other worlds when he was on a case; his incessant preoccupation with work; his inability to face everyday problems. The disappointment on the floor was the last straw.”\n“Poor chap,” I said feelingly. “He can’t help being what he is!”\n“That,” Boaz spoke severely, “is a good excuse for any scoundrel. But be this as it may, Morag’s resulting disenchantment with dancing tells it own tale about the man’s megalomania! Morag can do no wrong! Varda’s elopement must be the fault of the Waltz, although it appeared such a rewarding pastime yesterday!”\n“We’ll have to agree to disagree about Morag. Still, his new orientation proved a good stroke of luck for us.”\n“Or an appallingly bad one for my poor client: why should Varda’s desertion of her dear Ehood have any bearing on the settlement offered to Omri Tal this morning?”\n“I’ve got to agree with you there,” I conceded. “Still, a twenty one thousand Pounds settlement is not to be sneezed at.”\n“Not when your income is IL4,000 per annum,” agreed Boaz.\n“But that is precisely what Omri was earning,” I pointed out.\n“That, Eli, is the taxed income on which he had to base his claim!”\n“Oh well,” I said, seeing light. “We thought he might have earned a bit more on the side.”\n“And how much did you think he was making on the sly?”\n“We didn’t really give the matter much thought. Say another 400 or 500 pounds?”\n“Omri Tal’s moonlighting brought him an extra IL6,000 per year. I’ve seen his ‘confidential books’, Eli.”\n“Six thousand,” I was stunned. “So that chap earned about ten thousand a year. That’s as much as Keren or Silver.”\n“Yes, Eli. Omri Tal was making as much as our top lawyers. And none of them has much to hide. They have to issue receipts!”\n“And Omri couldn’t base his claim on real earnings for fear of prosecution?”\n“The Income Tax people have been after him for a few years. The stupid idiot put most of his black money into a luxury apartment purchased in his own name. They gave him the benefit of the doubt when he said the money was left to him by a relative in America. But they’ve kept a watchful eye.”\n“Oh, well; but didn’t he get back to his tricks when he returned to work?”\n“No, he didn’t. Didn’t something catch your eye when you went over his employment record?”\n“Before he started his own business he was a job hopper! We wondered why he changed jobs so often. He seems a good tradesman.”\n“An excellent one. But he was too greedy. He pinched clients when he was still with a firm: got dentists to send work to his own backroom establishment at slashed prices. When his employers found out, they showed him the door. None of them reported him because they too had jam on their fingers.”\n“I see. But what was there to stop him in his tracks when he was back on deck?”\n“Just before the accident he engaged two assistants. The silly idiot trusted them. Well, when he had the accident they did a dirty on him!”\n“Serve him right,” I muttered. “But still, why didn’t he undercut them further once he got well?”\n“He tried; but the margin got very low and the risk became too high. He went to see them and they agreed to buy him out.”\n“Joseph Almog’s last report mentioned Omri had sold his practice for IL3,000” I nodded; “not exactly riches!”\n“But he’s getting another four thousand from them as soon as he opens his new workshop in Be’er Sheva. Israel Silver is the stakeholder!’\n“So that explains why Omri is in such a hurry to get down South?”\n“That and because he’s really fed up with Tel Aviv. Give him credit for that, Eli. Be charitable!”\n“Not an easy task. I think about the pittance Israel Silver and Jacob Keren pay to hard working characters like you and me. Pfui, Boaz! Pfui to charity!”\n“Don’t get hot under the collar, Eli. Think of the fame we’ll gain while Omri continues to repair filthy dentures and works from casts sucked in saliva!”\n“You’ve got a point there,” I sighed. “But don’t tell me money doesn’t count. I shudder to think of Keren’s reaction when Rotem’s in-house accountants haggle over our forthcoming fee note. Hannah and I will cop it! Hopefully, you’ll do better with Omri!”\n“You must be joking!”\n“Surely, in the very least you get our sainted scale fees!”\n“Scale fees!” Boaz, lost his cool. “When it comes to money, Omri Tal is a bastard. He’s paying only 60 per cent of the scale fees. And I, Eli, got an omelette on my face this morning! And I put in over 200 hours of work!”\n“Why on earth did you accept such a rotten deal?”\n“Because some two years ago Omri Tal amused himself by trying to teach me chess openings. I’m still as lousy as before. Still, Omri Tal used that ‘help’ as a lever to demand a hefty discount when he brought me this rotten case. And on top of it, he bloody well pulled the wool over my eyes!”\n“So, we are all left holding the sack,” I could not resist giving vent to my feelings. “Omri gets what is, in reality, a poor settlement; you are chewed up; Hannah makes a fool of herself; and our firm will earn what Rotem graciously consent to pay in due course. The old Israelites were more lucky than us: Manna from heaven for a leisurely stroll across the desert!”\n“Care to try it?” grinned Boaz.\n“No, thank you. I’d better stick to the Law. Jacob Keren’s firm ain’t paradise; but in the very least it’s not a wilderness.”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/the-luck-of-valentino/part-14/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eEager  to  make her report to Ruth Schwartz, Hannah  left  straightaway.

He was watching me closely. I contemplated him with admiration. Despite his unappealing appearance I was mesmerised by his bright eyes. True, they looked straight through me and read my thoughts effortlessly and accurately, stripping me of all pretence. All the same, I sensed their warmth and was captivated by the understanding they reflected. I knew I was facing a being superior to me and realised I was in the presence of an intellect that dwarfed mine. Nonetheless, I was overcome by an intense feeling of brotherhood.\n“You have been my friend all along, Theophil. In a way, you were always with me, if you know what I mean.”\n“Fundamentally, you are right. But remember: I am no altruist. From the start I knew one day we might talk in this fashion.”\n“Why didn’t you come earlier?”\n“You weren’t ready. I had to prepare the ground: I hate failure!”\n“I trust you,” I said inconsequentially. “But Theophil, are you really here – in front of me?”\n“Surely, you no longer doubt my existence. I believe you are convinced.”\n“I am. But are you here physically?”\n“I am not flesh and blood. You have discerned that. Well, what is on your mind?”\n“Just now you were Peppi. A few years ago you appeared to me in the form of Friedrich Duval. Now you are Theophil, who, earlier on, revealed himself to Dad in Munich. Are you real or just an image?”\n“You shook hands with Fra Diablo!”\n“But when I rushed after him, he had vanished into thin air. It doesn’t make sense. I hope you don’t mind my speaking bluntly.”\n“I should not be here if I minded. Still, to answer your question, let’s shake hands again.”\nSmiling, he held his hand out; try as I might, I could not grasp it. My hand passed through his as if it were thin air. It was as if I was trying to touch an image projected on a three-dimensional screen. Reading my thoughts, he dropped his hand onto the desk within my reach. It looked real. But, when I placed my own hand over it, my palm came to rest on the smooth wooden surface without making contact.\n“Would you mind lifting your thumb?” I asked.\n“Always happy to oblige,” he teased.\nInitially, my hand closed around a void. Then, slowly, a feeling of contact took over. Closing my hand firmly, I sensed the touch of the leathery skin and the knuckles beneath it.\n“Got ’cha!”\n“Not for long,” he countered, and although my fingers continued to encircle his thumb, the sensation of contact was gone.\nMy mind was now racing, seeking to grasp the new reality. Was it the experience of watching an object projected on a cinema screen from a source that could transmit not just light and sound but other sensations, such as touch and smell?\n“Slow down,” he urged. “You’re going too fast, far too fast!”\n“Sorry,” I said apologetically, startled by his anxious tone. “Somehow, your proximity has stimulated my thought processes.”\n“It has. But your mind is not programmed to work at this speed. You might burn yourself out. I have had some sad experiences.”\n“So your presence acts as a catalyst. Is it because our intellect is modelled on yours?”\n“Either that or because both stem from the same mould. Mine, though, is not handicapped by the constraints of a body.”\n“But do you have any physical – bodily – existence?”\n“You were on the right track when I had to break in. You feel, hear and see me through a sensation I produce in your mind.”\n“And Friedrich Duval; and the locum in Munich?”\n“I can make myself felt by a crowd. Further, I can appear in person – as a physical being. But this involves a risk and so I tend to avoid it.”\n“How then did Friedrich Duval give me the Masked Harlequin?”\nHe did not answer but, as if by magic, a pot of tea, a sugar bowl, a milk jug and cup and saucer materialised in front of me. Turning the cup over, I smiled at him gratefully. It displayed an early Meissen mark.\n“Won’t you join me?” I asked.\n“With pleasure,” he answered, pouring the steaming tea into both my cup and its twin that had appeared in front of him.\nI enjoyed the aromatic tea but, most of all, concentrated on the porcelain pieces. Once we had finished, Theophil said nonchalantly: “I’m delighted you like the set. So let us place it in your Meissen cabinet.”\n“It’s \u0026hellip; in Singapore,” I stammered.\n“I know. Well, let us see on which shelf the set looks at its best.”\nMy eyes almost popped out of my head as the cabinet with my Meissen pieces materialised in its full splendour against one of the walls. Unable to contain myself, I walked over, moved some of the early figurines from the middle to the upper shelf and carefully placed my new pieces in the centre. For a while I was unable to tear myself away from my treasures. The world around me – even my ephemeral friend of the twilight zone – had ceased to exist. Then, with an effort, I turned back to him gratefully.\n“They’ll be there when you get home,” he said as the cabinet vanished.\n“How did you get them, Theophil?”\n“I bought them from the Meissen store. I kept them in my own environment until I found somebody who would appreciate them as much as I do.”\nOnce again I was captivated by the look in his eyes. They were no longer ominous or threatening. Their determined, proud and penetrating glance searched for understanding.\n“There is much humanity in you, Theophil,” I said, overcome by a deep sense of commitment.\nHis image remained in front of me. Yet, suddenly, I was alone in Peppi’s old study. Theophil’s keen eyes were no longer holding mine. I was gazing into lenses of unimaginable length, blurred as if by a fog at the end of an infinite tunnel.\n“Theophil, where are you?” I screamed inwardly. “Don’t leave me alone here!”\n“Sorry to give you a fright,” he replied looking at me again as before. “For just a moment I returned to \u0026hellip; base. Your words startled me. And no, don’t worry: you have not offended me!”\n“Did I say something out of the ordinary?”\n“You did, rather. I have been called many things: powerful, resourceful, and – less flatteringly – evil, vile, and tricky. But nobody has told me before that there is a human element in me. Was your statement triggered by your mind?”\n“No. It came from my heart. You see, I was deeply moved!”\n“By my gift?”\n“That too, but mainly by your expression.”\n“Try to tell me – without dissecting – what exactly moved you.”\n“My happiness brought you joy. I saw it in your eyes and \u0026hellip; I felt it!”\n“Is this, then, the human element?”\n“I believe it is. Man is cruel to man. People exploit each other and are often ruthless and, alas, unscrupulous. All the same, they need each other. Man is not an island. He is not self-sufficient. You know of course what is the worst punishment you can inflict on a criminal?”\n“Prolonged solitary confinement. I have seen strong men and self-assured women driven to insanity in their isolated cells! But then, aren’t many other mammals herd animals?”\n“They are. But in animals, the herd drive is instinctive: it secures the survival of the pack and the species. The survival instinct may also be the origin of the drive in man. Yet the human urge is more complex. Man needs to share his emotions with other humans: his woes, his sadness, his victories and his happiness. I suspect that this type of social urge – social appetite as the pundits call it – is confined to us.”\n“It is,” he confirmed calmly. “You are also right about me: Theophil is unique. But he, too, needs to share his thoughts and experiences. He turns to humans because they have the intellect and the capacity to respond.”\n“So, notwithstanding your repeated assertions to the contrary, you do have emotions. You are not just the power of pure reason. You know joy, hate, defeat. And you know how to smile!”\n“Quite so. But my ‘reactions’ are not comparable to your race’s emotions. Put simply, I react and respond; but my actual acts are based on my reasoning process.”\n“All the same, you seek out those with whom you wish to share your thoughts and ‘reactions’.”\n“I do. But – then – I am selective when I choose my friends!”\n“I see.” I was touched by his words. “Why do you appear in this \u0026hellip; form, when you reveal yourself to a potential friend?”\n“This is a term of the pact between Him and me.”\n“Are you referring to the Treaty made after the \u0026hellip; rebellion? I do not accept your ‘violent revolt’ evolving into a war of sulphur and fire. It sounds bizarre: two unique forces battling physically.”\n“Sheer nonsense – I agree. My first ‘rebellion’ was my attempt to create a Man in my own intellectual image. He objected and so we had an ‘engagement’ of sorts. He won but thought it best to conclude the affair with a mutually acceptable treaty. Both of us have observed it ever since. Nowadays we are on the best of terms.”\n“But how about your whispering to Eve that blind obedience was untenable and that an order should be obeyed only if anchored in reason. Wasn’t this a second ‘revolt’?” I asked him.\n“What makes you think this ‘whisper’ was a rebellion?”\n“It must have been, because Man’s ‘role’ was to obey blindly, unthinkingly. When you encouraged Eve to yield to temptation, you upset the order ordained by Him. In the process you set us free!”\n“I did, rather,” he smirked. “But my encounter with Eve did not entail a ‘revolt’. The two metaphysical forces made a bet. He was certain Man would never disobey him. I had my doubts. So, Peter’le, we set out to settle the point. In the process I proved that Man had his own agenda. He conceded the bet.”\n“I see. You utilised a flaw in his preordained order of things. You acted as a catalyst.”\n“How?”\n“By triggering our intellectual curiosity and by feeding our yearning to comprehend cause and effect. We ought to thank you for nurturing our spark of independence, for acting as our pilot along the winding passage.”\n“How did I act as pilot?”\n“Didn’t you, once upon a time, assume the name Prometheus?”\n“No, I didn’t. I am no interventionist. I did not steal the fire from the Gods! In any case, I have no liver. An eagle couldn’t peck at it.”\n“But didn’t you teach us to use fire?”\nAgain he did not answer, but this time he produced a vast kaleidoscope. At the end of the tunnel I perceived a man, with a strangely shaped cranium and dangling arms, sitting by a burning tree in a dark forest. Wrapping an untanned fur firmly around him, he rubbed his hands with satisfaction. When a strong gust of wind signalled the approach of another thunderstorm, he rose to his feet anxiously, his eyes fixed on the fire. For a moment he looked around him helplessly. Then his expression changed. Breaking a thick branch off a tree, he thrust it into the smouldering ashes. The moment it caught fire he ran off, clutching this torch. Following his steps, I saw him entering a cave and calling out loudly.\n“Getting him to concentrate was an effort. You see, I did not put the idea in his head. All I did was assist him to focus on his own ‘notion’.”\n“Well: I was right about you all along!”\n“You were. Still, my promptings have also led to much misery: think of the bow and arrow, the gun and all instruments of war; and don’t forget the thumbscrew. They too are products of Man’s intellect. Progress has not been an uninterrupted upward journey.”\n“Did you anticipate this?”\n“I knew all along that it was feasible. The intellect is a tool. My object is to advance it. Any resulting ‘evil’ is a by-product.”\n“A by-product of what?” I asked.\n“Of Man’s emotive structure. You can call it a by-product of ‘human nature’ for which I, Theophil, claim no responsibility!”\n“But what, then, induced you to prod our intellect?”\n“As I told you, I am no altruist. Neither am I motivated by sadistic impulses. The development of the human mind serves my object! Have you worked out what it might be?”\n“To spur on those you may wish to associate with – to close the gap that separates you from them?”\n“I should rather say: to enlighten those likely to search for me!”\n“By which you mean: to help them search for reason in an irrational universe?”\n“Precisely,” he nodded.\n“This has been the theme of my own life. True, my search was often interrupted. Sometimes it became sporadic. But, like Peppi before me, I have not abandoned it.”\n“I know. That’s why I am here!”\n“Will you then accept me?” I asked.\n“But are you holding your hand out to me or to Peppi?”\n“To you. Peppi’s presence is comforting and, as you well know, his friendship prepared me for my discourse with you. But Theophil, his own story would remain incomplete unless his object was served by my pact with you. So, in reality, my hand reaches out to both of you.”\n“Have you made up your mind?”\n“I have! But you, Theophil, look undecided.”\n“True! Your orientation suits me. But your motivation poses a hurdle.”\n“My motivation? I tried to free myself from dogma since boyhood!”\n“But weren’t you prompted by emotions triggered by your years as refugee?”\n“Perhaps. All in all, though, mine was an intellectual response. I found the answers given to my basic questions unacceptable. They induced me to reject conventional dogma.”\n“This was in all probability the main cause. And the piety and pedantry of your teachers in primary school in Tel Aviv added fuel to your fire. So did the ragging of your Orthodox classmates, who objected to the non-Kosher sandwiches you brought with you for lunch. The stupidity of some of your secondary school teachers cemented your ‘heretic’ stance.”\n“My sheer hatred of dogma, Theophil, is gone. Over the years, you have set me free.”\n“I have. You are now free to turn either way: onward with me or back to Him. The choice is yours!”\n“I have no wish to turn back!”\n“Are you certain?”\n“I am!”\n“But why? Didn’t you wrong Him amongst others? Shouldn’t you consider your next step carefully?”\n“My equations, Theophil, still hold true. I may have worked them out for the wrong reason. I know this now. But aren’t they foolproof?”\n“Why don’t we put them to the test together?”\nIt took me a while to overcome my reluctance. The formulas I had taken years to perfect were bound to appear basic, unsophisticated, to him. His encouraging smile, though, gave me heart.\n“The proposition I question is the existence of a perfect God who created us in his own image. If this postulate is proved true, there is no room for argument. He then deserves our thanks and veneration. If, by contrast, the proposition is flawed, there is no rational basis for the love and worship which we are expected to lavish on Him.”\n“And why is that so?” he asked.\n“Because the foundation on which the tenet is postulated is, then, shattered.”\n“How is the tenet proved wrong?”\n“By its internal inconsistency,” I said fervently. “It postulates a perfect and omnipotent creator who shaped a world occupied by humans created in his own image. I maintain that the imperfection of Man proves the imperfection of the creator in whose image Man was moulded.”\n“Does the deficiency of the product establish the maker’s failing?”\n“If the imperfect product was made in his own image – it does. If the image is faulty, can the mirror image be perfect?”\n“But can’t the maker, or creator, make a mistake?”\n“Can perfection be imperfect? If a potter throws a defective piece, he discards it. He then reforms the clay and starts again. He may succeed. Still, the inadequacy of the first piece establishes that the potter has his failings!”\n“Me’thinks,” smiled Theophil, “that you make much of a single argument. You equate ‘perfect’ with ‘faultless’. But even if we accept this point, how do you refute the creator’s omnipotence?”\n“Can an imperfect Prince be omnipotent? Doesn’t the imperfection render him vulnerable!”\n“Agreed. But do you rest your argument on that single sequence?”\n“No, Theophil. I have two further arguments up my sleeve!”\n“Quite some sleeve,” he chuckled. “Would you like another nip to sustain you?”\n“Thanks.” I sipped the fiery liqueur appreciatively. Then, in a calmer tone, I continued: “The act of creation, which we presume to be wilful, establishes that He is neither perfect nor omnipotent!”\n“Would you care to explain?”\n“If He were perfect, he would not have experienced the urge to create. Any move from a perfect state must, by definition, be a move towards imperfection!”\n“I am glad you have seen the point.”\n“Didn’t the great ones?”\n“They shut their eyes to it in their barren attempt to prove a foregone conclusion! But you – Peter’le – still have to establish that the creation, or the wish to create, refutes the creator’s omnipotence!”\n“That is my remaining point. The wish to create a world in order to be worshipped by it is a manifestation of the creator’s doubt and insecurity. An omnipotent creator – like an outstanding teacher – does not desire to be praised or worshipped!”\n“Touché,” said my lifelong friend.\n“May I expand on this?” I asked, savouring his praise.\n“There is no need. Your sequence is conceptually irrefutable. But me’thinks you wish to add a pragmatic point!”\n“I do indeed. I maintain that perfection and omnipotence are inseparable. You can’t have the one without the other. His letting the world degenerate into the depraved state so often encountered in our sad history casts doubt on the perfection of his original creation and on his ability to rectify the faults. Hence it casts doubt on his omnipotence. Accordingly, the onus of establishing His perfection and omnipotence rests on those who assert them. Neither point is provable by rational argumentation!”\n“To accept them you must make an act of faith, which is an emotive response: dictated by wish and desire. Well, can you refute faith?” asked Theophil.\n“I can’t, I won’t and I don’t wish to! I cannot accept ‘faith’ because, to me, it is ‘blind’!”\n“Why then do you wish to join me?”\n“Because you are the manifestation of reason. It was you who liberated us, humans, from a naive existence in Utopia; and it was you who set us on our quest for identity and individuality. I realise you are neither perfect nor omnipotent and that you make no claim to either. But to me this is immaterial. I have no use for perfection.”\n“Are you then committed?”\n“I am!” I confirmed, holding my hand out to him.\n“Welcome to the brotherhood.” I grasped his leathery hand firmly, and a deep sensation of achievement, of fulfilment, ran through me.\nFor a while we sat together peacefully, a sense of harmony binding me to him. Then, as scenes from my life rushed through my galvanised mind, a question formed.\n“No,” he told me even before I expressed it. “There is no ‘price’. The notion is far too simplistic. True, in the wrangling between Him and me we accepted a loose arrangement. Frequently, those who attempt to follow me are made to go through a period of suffering. They may end up ‘repenting’, disowning me in the process and turning back to Him. I have never tried to stop them. Their route then parts from mine!”\n“So only those who are fully committed remain in your fold?”\n“Precisely. And they are the ones I treasure. You, Peter’le, went through your bad spell long ago. You are a free agent!”\n“I have made my choice,” I said.\n“Acceptance of God can come most unexpectedly. I have had my disappointments. You, too, will have your choice to the last,” his voice full of both sadness and pride.\n“I have my conviction!” I assured him. Then, as I sensed he was getting ready to depart, I added anxiously: “Please, do come to me often.”\n“I shall. And you must teach yourself to turn to me when I am needed.”\nI was about to answer when a bold knock at the door interrupted us.\nIrritated, I snapped, “Who on earth can that be?”\n“They have come to pick up this furniture. Wasn’t it careless of them to leave it behind? Well, you’d better let them in. See you soon.”\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/the-devil-in-munich/chapter-14/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eFor a while we remained silent. He was watching me closely. I contemplated him with admiration. Despite his unappealing appearance I was mesmerised by his bright eyes.

All the same, I sensed their warmth and was captivated by the understanding they reflected.

As you say: Keren’s firm isn’t paradise; ditto for Israel Silver’s outfit. Why don’t we make ourselves independent?”\n“Start a new practice? There are some two hundred law firms in Tel Aviv?”\n“Even so, don’t you think we can make it? We had good training; and we’ve worked well together as a team in law school!”\n“But how about \u0026hellip;”\n“I’m pretty sure Rachel Zeitlin will approve. I’ve dropped a hint her way a few days ago, and she told me to talk to you first. And I have already identified a good documentation lawyer. We’ll need one. Well, are you interested?”\n“Subject to a chat with Rachel. But from what you say, I’m pretty sure she’ll agree.”\n“So let’s agree in principle,” said Boaz with satisfaction. “There is, of course, no hurry. At this stage, we still have a lot learn from the grand old men. Still, in a year or perhaps in two we’ll be ready. And there’ll be nothing to stop us!”\n“Precisely,” I said and shook his outstretched hand.\nFor a few minutes, both of us were lost in our thoughts. Eventually, Boaz broke the silence: “I’ll have to make a move now. And it’s really high time you come over to our place again. Oh yes, and do bring Rachel with you. Miri is dying to meet your girl friend.”\n“We’ll come over early next week.”\n“See you then. Do give us a ring: Miri is sure to prepare something special to impress Rachel. See you soon.”\nLooking around me after Boaz had left, I realised there was no other patron in the establishment. I was about to leave when David Mizrachi came over with two steaming mugs of coffee.\n“Please, Mr Eli, I need your advice.”\n“How can I help you, David,” I said when he joined the table and placed one mug in front of me.\nDavid Mizrachi curled his long sideburns nervously with his right hand. “You see, Mr Eli, Sarah and I have a big plan. We make a little bit of money here; good money. Two years ago I bought the whole building.”\n“You are a capitalist, David,” I said amused.\n“I’m not sure what you mean, Mr. Eli. But you see, now it is our house. So, Mr. Eli, we want to make this a large restaurant, with nice tables, colourful tablecloth, and good chairs. You know what I mean?”\n“But David,” I let my concern show, “you’ll have to raise your prices and then many of us will have to go to some other place. And this will be sad.”\n“No, Mr. Eli, the prices will be the same. We want our guests to be happy. And in a bigger place we will have more guests; so, no need to raise prices. We’ll make less from one meal but more because we serve more!”\n“Good financial planning. You, David, should have been a banker!”\n“Too complicated, Mr. Eli. For us the restaurant is good enough. But now, Mr. Eli, here is my problem: we want to give our new restaurant a grand name – a name with quality!”\n“What sort of name are you looking for, David?”\n“I want lawyers to come to our place. The name must make them feel at home, Mr. Eli.”\n“That’s simple, David. Why not call it: ‘The Lucky Lawyers Haven’?”\n“Why ‘Luck’ and ‘Haven?” wondered David.\n“Because lawyers know success depends on luck. And a ‘haven’ is where they hide to get away from pressure at work!”\n“Thanks Mr. Eli. Sarah and I will think it over. Would you like another coffee, or perhaps a Humus? It’s on the house.”\n“Thanks, David. But it’s getting late, and I have to pick up Miss Zeitlin. We go to Habimah this evening.”\n“Have a good time then, Mr. Eli, and come again soon,” said David warmly.\nOutside it was drizzling. Shrugging my shoulders in resignation, I pulled up the collar of my raincoat. I was on my way to meet Rachel: neither the rain nor the cold wind wiped an inward looking smile – a smile of anticipation – off my face.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/the-luck-of-valentino/part-15/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e“Well Eli,” said Boaz after a short lull. “This is a good a time to bring up  a point I wanted to raise with you for a while.

The former smacked his lips appreciatively as he reinserted the cork into the neck of the bottle of Slivovitz which I had asked him to take away with him.\nFor a while I wandered through the empty rooms, scenes from my many encounters with Peppi and Lucy racing through my mind. It was only after I had pulled the front door shut that I noticed it was raining heavily. Instantly, I realised that I had left my umbrella in the stand in the entrance hall. Looking around me anxiously for cover, my mind strayed to Theophil. At the very same moment I heard a sharp sound and turned to see my umbrella hanging from the door handle. Had the men put it there?\nAs I walked down the road, the clouds gathered at the skies turned an ominous dark grey. Soon the howling storm threatened to tear my umbrella from my hand. “What wouldn’t I give for a taxi?” I groaned inwardly, adding spontaneously: “Theophil!”\nFor a moment, my ears doubted the welcome hum of the approaching car’s engine. Then, as the taxi’s dimmed headlights emerged through the deluge, an immense feeling of gratitude descended on me. Sinking into the comfortable seat, I said to the driver: “Lucky for me you passed by!”\n“Quite,” he agreed. He turned and winked; and I realised who he was.\n“Thanks for coming to my aid,” I told Theophil.\n“Don’t mention it. I had to make certain you would know how to turn to me. Well, to occupy us during this horrid storm, let us take an excursion through human history. It will reinforce your equations!”\n“You could write a perfect history of mankind, couldn’t you, Theophil?” I observed, when we were back in present day London.\n“Factually, it would be accurate.”\n“But?” I asked.\n“The interpretation may be faulty. I have not mastered the finer nuances of human machinations. No wonder Fra Diablo’s students were critical of his exposition of the Reformation. One of them went so far as to say that the Herr Professor was naive!”\n“But you can read our minds?”\n“If I apply myself to the task. When I don’t, I tend to overlook the emotive background to human events.”\n“This, then, is why you wanted Peppi, with his keen understanding of human nature, to join your ranks.”\nAs we continued en route, a strange thought – initially just a vague notion – began to form in my mind. Soon a barrage of ideas was tumbling through my mind, but, recalling Theophil’s grave warning, I checked myself. When I was ready, I got his attention.\n“I believe I have hit on a sequence establishing that perfection is unattainable.”\n“Let’s have it.” I sensed his excitement.\n“Perfection can exist only when the whole universe is flawless – without even a hint of discord. The very notion of imperfection existing side by side with perfection establishes that perfection has not been reached!”\n“Well?” he prompted.\n“Movement in space and in time is the essence of the universe. Even the galaxies keep expanding as time moves on! A static state is incompatible with the nature of the universe. Indeed, the absence of movement, in what we regard as a perfect static state, would be a flaw and hence an imperfection.”\n“And your conclusion?”\n“A state of perfection is imperfect!”\nThe taxi came to a gentle halt on an isolated unearthly plane and Theophil, in his traditional form, materialised beside me. Knowing that my thoughts had been sparked off by his proximity, I said, my voice charged with emotion: “Thank you for opening my eyes – eyes that observed but didn’t perceive!”\n“You didn’t need much help. You were ready,” he answered.\n“You, Theophil, are searching for answers to questions that are still imponderable. Are you, then, looking for clues to events preceding your own materialisation?”\n“Mine and His: I look for data pertaining to an era beyond the discernible horizon.”\n“And I shall be with you as you continue searching.”\n“You will,” he said eagerly. “But remember, there are no guarantees: we, too, may stray!”\n“The road to El Dorado is paved with gold even if the destination remains illusory,” I told him.\n“You have spoken wisely,” he affirmed happily.\nLooking out of the window, I observed that the taxi had once again merged with the flow of traffic.

One day I received an email in which the sender, who signed himself as Chula Jeyaratne, asked me for lunch. Initially, I was unable to identify him. I then recalled that I had met Ranjan’s younger brother, whose name was Chula, during my first visit to Colombo.\nThe man in his late middle age, who had arrived at the agreed venue before me, bore no resemblance to that unformed boy I had met years earlier. His black hair was laced with silver and his face was wrinkled.\nDuring the first course, we stuck to small talk. He told me that he had a son and two daughters, all pursuing their studies in England. His son, I was amused to learn, read for Law in Ranjan’s old college at Oxford. Chula himself was a graduate of King’s College of London University. After years as a computer expert in Colombo, he had moved to Singapore. He had no intention of returning to Sri Lanka. It had become a violent and unstable country. Singapore, in contrast, was a place of peace even if rather hectic. Chula had secured a post as the Head of the IT team in a leading industrial enterprise.\n“Ranjan’s assassination took place years ago,” he observed after the waiter had placed our main courses in front of us, “its tenth anniversary was three days ago,\n“How far is the episode still remembered in Sri Lanka?” I asked.\nAccording to Chula, Ranjan’s assassination remained fresh in the memory of members of his own the clan. Other people were too engrossed in their own lives to recall a political murder that had taken place in a previous era. All in all, Ranjan Jayaratne’s name was largely forgotten.\n“ Who had taken over?” I wanted to know. “As far as I recall, the then President was himself killed by a suicide bomber some ten days after he had arranged to eliminate your brother. A Tamil Tiger attack, I gather!”\n“Yes, it had been a Tamil Tiger plot,” nodded Chula. “But what makes you think that Ranjan’s killer was hired by the President?”\n“Wasn’t he the chap behind the killing? Everybody assumed he had initiated the assassination contract!”\n“It was conventional truth,” conceded Chula, “but actually it wasn’t the President’s long hand. He was horrified when the news was out and asserted that he had had nothing to do with the killing. And, you know, he told the truth. That fellow was a corrupt and ruthless politician. But he wasn’t stupid. He knew only too well that any attempt on Ranjan’s life would be attributed to him. Also, I think he wanted to win by a fair vote; not by a filthy plot!”\n“So who was behind it?” I asked, bewildered. “The Tamil Tigers?”\nChula’s advised me that that supposition was also unfounded. He then told me what had really happened. Ranjan’s decision to quit the party was partly motivated by his realisation that a somewhat younger rival intended to jump over his back; and the fellow was warming his way into the incumbent’s favour. Ranjan had sensed that, before long, he would cease to be the heir elect.\n“And did that fellow get there?” I wanted to know.\n“No, he didn’t. When the President was assassinated another politician stole a march over him.”\n“And what has happened to him since?”\n“He lives as a recluse in Kandy; and he is bitter. He feels he had spent a lot of money to organise the killing, only to bring someone else into power.”\n“What happened to the assassin?”\n“Some three months after the shooting, two men burst into his house and liquidated him and his entire family! This too was organised by that fellow”\n“I see. But can you tell me who was – or is – that organising fellow? Is he somebody I would have heard of?”\n“Actually, I think you met him. He, too, was at Oxford. And for a while he went out with a girl who knew Ranjan. Her name was Lillo.”\n“Don’t tell me that chap’s name is Joseph X!”\n“That’s him,” answered Chula dryly.\nOnce again, my mind was in turmoil. Joseph had good reason to hate Ranjan. The very girl he had hoped to marry, took her life when she had comprehended Ranjan was not going to come back to her. In a subtle, singularly indirect manner, my own indiscretion of making that clear to Lillo, had – years later – been one of the links in the chain ending with Ranjan’s assassination. So Fortuna, too, paid attention to cause and effect. She, too, had a sense of justice even if, to an occasional onlooker, it appeared twisted.\n“But didn’t Ranjan appreciate the dangers facing him?” I wanted to know.\n“He did, rather. And you know, I had my contacts in the underworld. For two million dollars I could have arranged to have both the President and Joseph eliminated!”\n“Did you tell this to Ranjan?”\n“Of course I did; I wanted him to raise the money; but he wouldn’t hear of it! He was furious.”\n“What did he say?” I prompted.\n“He said he didn’t have two million dollars and then yelled: ‘How can the two of us be the sons of the same father? And you know Father would never dirty his hands in such a ploy. If I win, it must be by a fair vote, and not by tricks.’ I was dumbfounded.”\nSo Ranjan had sealed the warrant for his own death. Two million dollars were – especially at that time – a great deal of money. But Ranjan’s bank statement gave his financial excuse the lie. To him, the sum was peanuts! The real reason for his angry reaction was plain. All in all, he too had a conscience. It might have been rather flexible – not as well defined as the common man’s – but, at the very least, it was not altogether left out of Ranjan’s make up. He was neither a saint nor a scoundrel through and through. Like most humans, he was somewhere in between.\nHad his life, his career and his aspirations been just a flash in the pan? He had left a widow and a daughter. After a pause, I asked what had become of them.\n“Ranjan’s widow won a seat in Parliament,” Chula told me. “Elected out of sympathy, I think.”\n“I thought she had at one time been made a cabinet member?”\n“Quite so,” affirmed Chula. “They put her in charge of a not too important ministry.”\n“And what became of Ranjan’s daughter? Did she go to one of the women’s colleges in Oxford.”\n“She was offered a place in Lady Margaret Hall but declined,” Chula let his displeasure show; then added reluctantly: “She is a beautiful woman; and so she became a photographic model. She is doing rather well out of it. You might have seen her on the cover of international magazines.”\n“It’s not a bad career,” I pointed out.\n“Her choice would have broken Ranjan’s heart. He wanted his daughter to be a scholar!”\n“Did he leave them enough money for a comfortable life?” I asked with hesitation.\n“He did: just the right amount. There are some ugly rumours in Colombo about a vast fortune kept with some posh Swiss bank. But I don’t believe a word of it; and the widow’s modest lifestyle gives the lie to this malicious gossip!”\nBefore we parted, I promised to arrange another lunch. However, before I did so Chula’s employers sent him to a branch in another country.\n","permalink":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novellas/a-candid-obituary/epilogue/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA few years later, Ranjan’s sad end  was vividly drawn back to my attention.
