Patiently Jacob Keren outlined the fresh proposal: Simha was promised a monthly pension equal to 90 per cent  of his last salary, index pegged, plus part-time employment as receptionist until he reached the normal age of retirement. His pension would be based on the average wages of his last two years and, again, would be indexed. In addition, Rotem would settle his running medical bills and related expenses. When Keren finished,  Israel Silver confirmed it was an excellent offer and “as far as one could expect the defendants to go.” Boaz nodded his approval."><meta name=author content="Peter Ellinger"><link rel=canonical href=https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/simha-glory/part-4/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.e202951f0a3d3ed30038a340950b058410502334f0fad4d7b11bc39c0cf0274e.css integrity="sha256-4gKVHwo9PtMAOKNAlQsFhBBQIzTw+tTXsRvDnAzwJ04=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/simha-glory/part-4/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/simha-glory/part-4/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Peter Ellinger"><meta property="og:title" content="Part 4: Seeking to Persuade Simha"><meta property="og:description" content="Some three weeks later, when Jacob Keren and I were shown into Israel Silver’s spacious office, the Balanis were already there.
