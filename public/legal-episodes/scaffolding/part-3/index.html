“She is no longer the woman I fell for. She is a different person.”
“But, Peter’le, did you fall for the real Rachel or did you create your own image of her?”
Mother’s question made me see light. The real Rachel was a fine woman: smart, vivacious and enterprising. She had entered into my barren life at the appropriate moment. But, in my simplicity, I had placed her on a pedestal. I had created a perfect statue and, like Pygmalion of old, was perturbed when I discovered her real image."><meta name=author content="Peter Ellinger"><link rel=canonical href=https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/scaffolding/part-3/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.05407458c8f32057ae942066f26311fb7c5c4ddb0a0d32101db306bece42c2be.css integrity="sha256-BUB0WMjzIFeulCBm8mMR+3xcTdsKDTIQHbMGvs5Cwr4=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/scaffolding/part-3/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/scaffolding/part-3/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Peter Ellinger"><meta property="og:title" content="Part 3: Discussing the Case with Mother"><meta property="og:description" content="Mother looked at me searchingly when I passed through the door.
