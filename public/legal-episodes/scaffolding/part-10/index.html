I admired the skill she showed as she steered us through the congested traffic. To my delight, we got the very table we used to occupy in the same restaurant in times past.\nRachel grinned again as I devoured the excellent dishes.

Why would an experienced expert witness step out of line for no apparent reason? He knew I had been instructed to handle him with silk gloves. What had induced him to become antagonistic when the reply was obvious and harmless?\n“I suspect there is a reason,” Rachel opined.\n“Boaz will tell me all he knows tomorrow over lunch.”\n“I too would like to know. But honestly, we’ve dug deep enough for the time being. Tell me a bit about your life in Oxford and in Singapore.”\nFor the next half hour, I told Rachel about my isolated but fruitful existence in Oxford: my well heated but lonely room, the junior common room and the pleasant strolls along the Cherwell and Addison’s Walk and my occasional trips to Woodstock. I then told her about my experiences as a teacher in Singapore, as a resident fellow in one of our halls and about the splendid meals in the canteen and in Chinatown.\nRachel, in turn, told me how she had met Uzi, how they went together to concerts, to the theatre and to the cinema and about their recent trips overseas. It was clear she had brought her ship home.\n“I’m glad you’ve got there, Rachel.”\n“But how about you, Eli? Do you have any regrets or hurt feelings?”\n“I’m sorry things did not work out for us. But I remain deeply grateful to you.”\n“For what?”\n“You transformed me from an immature boy into a young man. I shall always think of you with affection.”\nAs we were getting ready to leave, Rachel mentioned that my mother told her about the girl I had met in Singapore. Rachel wanted to know more about the girl and about my plans. Was I going to settle in Singapore?\nShe smiled happily when I told her Pat was beautiful and had a presence. Still, Rachel manifested concern when I told her Pat did not share my interests in art and literature and had no academic bent. She was, further, perturbed by Pat’s ardent Christianity. Rachel knew I was either an agnostic or an atheist. At the same time, Rachel knew that my revolt against Faith and Judaism concealed a firm commitment to the tribe. She did not think I would never be happy if I were induced to change my religion. She was reassured when I told her how much Pat cared for me and that Pat’s family had welcomed me as I was. They knew I had no intention of changing my skin.\nRachel realised that my plans had been worked out neatly. The University provided subsidized accommodation for its staff and did much to encourage expatriate staff members to stay put. Both financially and in terms of prestige, my future was more secure in Singapore than it could ever be in Israel.\nFor a while Rachel reflected. She then summed up with the confidence and clarity she manifested whenever she dealt with an issue.\n“Look, Eli, in these personal matters every person has to make his own decision. But I want to give you one solid advice: be guided by your instincts. Personal decisions concerning a relationship, a union or a divorce are not dictated by reason. They are produced by emotions. In that area, instincts provide the best guide. Even in a courtroom skirmish they have a role to play. Still, reason often forces you to suppress them. This should not happen in your personal life.”\nRachel drove me back to my parents’ flat. Before we parted, she asked me to give her regards to mother. In a sense, she transported me back to the place from which I had come over to her originally.\n","wordCount":"691","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-07-21T21:45:46+08:00","dateModified":"2025-07-21T21:45:46+08:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Peter Ellinger"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/scaffolding/part-10/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Peter Ellinger","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/ accesskey=h title="Peter Ellinger (Alt + H)">Peter Ellinger</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
