The Hendra affair did not disrupt my good relations with Norbert and Freddie. And strangely enough, the tension between them eased. In a sense, the affair brought them together.
Hendra remained a thorn in the Bank’s side. On quite a few occasions, as I passed by the building housing the Bank, I saw Hendra proceeding happily on to Collyer Quay. I had no doubt that, on each occasion, he had managed either to extend or to replenish his overdraft."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/matter-of-compliance/part-7/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.05407458c8f32057ae942066f26311fb7c5c4ddb0a0d32101db306bece42c2be.css integrity="sha256-BUB0WMjzIFeulCBm8mMR+3xcTdsKDTIQHbMGvs5Cwr4=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/matter-of-compliance/part-7/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/matter-of-compliance/part-7/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Peter Ellinger"><meta property="og:title" content="Part 7: Hendra Settles with the Bank"><meta property="og:description" content="1.
