Don’t you worry.”\n“What will you do?”\n“I’ll devote the time left to me to the breeding of tropical fish. I’m good at it: much better than with currencies and shares.”\n“How splendid!” I replied.\nBang Bang Hendra smiled with satisfaction. He then gave me a copy of a book on fish breeding he had published in Jakarta. As I had no command of Indonesian, I was unable to read it. Nevertheless, I knew I was viewing a magnum opus. The colour plates, which I perused with fascination, demonstrated Hendra’s love of and devotion to his hobby.\nI had no doubt the publication had cost him a fortune. He would, of course, be unable to recover his investment. The photography alone had taken many hours of patient observation, good planning, and time spent studying techniques for taking pictures of this type. I was also certain that he had spent a great deal of money on the acquisition of cameras and various other pieces of equipment.\nObviously, Hendra had changed his focus. He had left his unsavoury dealings behind him. It might have been a narrow escape. All the same, he had managed to break away. After many a fall, he had finally landed on his feet and had resolved to devote himself to an activity he found interesting. In this sense, he had been smiled upon by Fortuna.\n","wordCount":"378","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-07-21T22:46:46+08:00","dateModified":"2025-07-21T22:46:46+08:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Peter Ellinger"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/matter-of-compliance/part-8/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Peter Ellinger","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/ accesskey=h title="Peter Ellinger (Alt + H)">Peter Ellinger</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
