But we know you have a substantial credit balance there.”\nHendra didn’t claim that the money belonged to his wife rather than to himself. He knew we were familiar with his trading patterns.

Norbert did his best to appear supportive and understanding; but the twinkle in his eye remained unchanged throughout the scene. I was relieved when, after some twenty minutes of pantomime, Hendra agreed to give us a cheque for S$125,000. Norbert promised to order the remittance of the funds as soon as the cheque had cleared. Smiling supportively, he proffered Hendra his own pen.\n“This was used to sign the ASEAN Treaty, Bang Bang,” he advised proudly.\n“Can I have it?” asked Hendra eagerly.\n“Of course!” said Norbert magnanimously, whilst I hid my face in a sheaf of papers and did my best to suppress a fit of laughter.\nTo my relief, Freddie was happy with the arrangement. All in all, it meant that Hendra’s overdraft was reduced to some S$125,000. Like the rest of us, Freddie knew that to win some you could not help losing others. In the instant case, the loss was moderate. The head office, too, was satisfied.\n","wordCount":"540","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-07-21T22:29:36+08:00","dateModified":"2025-07-21T22:29:36+08:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Peter Ellinger"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/matter-of-compliance/part-6/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Peter Ellinger","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/ accesskey=h title="Peter Ellinger (Alt + H)">Peter Ellinger</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
