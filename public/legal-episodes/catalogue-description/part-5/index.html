Lawrence Gent was known as a fine courtroom advocate. He was as excellent when it came to legal points as when a case turned on the facts. At one stage, we appointed him dean but his commitments at court prevented him from running the faculty efficiently and so resigned. All of us treated him as the grand old man of the law school. His visits to the rooms of other colleagues were scarce.\nFor a while we looked out of the window and relished the view. Eventually, Lawrence broke the silence.\n“You do have a grand view, Peter. Best office in our faculty.”\n“You did me proud,” I smiled at him. “but did you really just want to enjoy the view from my window, Old Boy?”\n“That too; but I am delighted to drop in on my friends when time permits.”\n“You didn’t look too ready for a tête-à-tête when I spotted you in our library a few days ago.”\n“Well, I was writing an opinion and, alas, business takes priority overly friendly chats.”\n“Were you by any chance dealing with Robert McBride’s latest case and have come over to discuss this matter now. I believe you knew that he had discuss this matter with me.”\n“Spot on, except that – as I said before – I enjoy catching up with all friends whenever time permits.” After pausing for a moment, he added: “And as to the matter you just mentioned: not one of Robert’s successes, I fear.”\n“That’s putting it mildly. The fellow made an ass of himself.”\n“Aren’t you too blunt? Still, from what I hear our Robert was not at his best.”\n“Actually, what is your connection with the case, Lawrence?”\n“Initially, I turned down the brief offered to me by the sales house. I avoid taking up cases, when a good friend is on the other side.”\n“Commendable. Still, your reticence didn’t save Robert. Thomas Bardwell made mincemeat of both Jack Smith and our Robert.”\n“Thomas is a fine lawyer. Not the best when it comes to analysing authorities or awkward points of law. But the man has common sense and is a good fighter. And he knows when to pull his punches.”\n“He acquired his strategical skills from accomplished teachers!”\n“Oh well, he is a good student,” conceded Lawrence.\nBy then, the reason of Lawrence’s visit and discussion dawned on me. Jack Smith’s solicitors must have asked for his opinion about an appeal. Lawrence, who was watching me keenly, turned to this very matter.\n“Well, Peter, what do you think about an appeal?”\n“Not on,” I told him.\n“But how about the last minute points concerning Smith’s purported mistake?”\n“Jack sought damages, Lawrence. Effectively, he wants to keep the mare and get the price reduced.”\n“Do you think he can get this?”\n“Off the record?”\n“Of course.”\n“The judgment is sound. A last minute attempt to amend the pleading was uncalled for. I would leave matters alone. At best, the Court of Appeal may send the case back for a rehearing. But on the judge’s findings a claim for damages is bound to fail.”\n“I agree,” Lawrence was resolute.\n“When you fine tune your opinion, do try to play down Robert’s blunders.”\n“I shall. But I’m afraid the harm has been done. It will take Robert some time to live the cese down.”\nNeither of us had any more to say about the subject. For a few minutes we gossiped about Faculty affairs. We then proceeded to the canteen for a cup of coffee.\n","wordCount":"608","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-07-21T22:03:12+08:00","dateModified":"2025-07-21T22:03:12+08:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Peter Ellinger"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/catalogue-description/part-5/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Peter Ellinger","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/ accesskey=h title="Peter Ellinger (Alt + H)">Peter Ellinger</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
