He then requested that expert witnesses be barred from attending the examination of the defendants’ evidence. Jack Wilson agreed and I was told by the Judge that I should not be present during the afternoon session.\nI was about to leave the courthouse when my eye rested on Yuri, Rena and the two policemen. They were enjoying a late lunch of sandwiches and pickles. Rena had just fetched mugs of hot coffee from the canteen. Yuri grinned at her proudly.

His admiring expression evidenced that, even if he did, he continued to trust her.\nAs an expert witness, I had no interest in the hidden facts. Curiosity, though, is known to have killed the cat.

And tell me, what do you think of the cafeteria?”\n“Rena,” interceded Yuri, “we better be grateful they have takeaways.”\n“Rubbish! This way they make more money, Yuri. They are not doing us a favour!” Turning to me she repeated firmly: “Well, what do you think of it?”\n“It could do with a face uplift. And the menu is somewhat limited.”\n“Somewhat limited …” she mimicked. “Lousy!!! Even no sandwich toaster. You should have seen my business. We even had doner kebab. It was a lovely business! Yuri was the chef. Customers came just to have a really good coffee and toast.”\n“What went wrong?” I asked indiscreetly.\n“You Mr. Vollar …”\n“Rena,” protested Yuri. “Such thing must not say. Mr. Vollar was our partner. He is nice man.”\nRena ignored the rebuke. “He greedy man. Wanted to make 10 per cent! How can?”\n“I don’t understand,” I conceded.\n“Look, Mr. …”\n“… ‘Peter’ will do…”\n“Cafeteria in courthouse, you want to come back.”\n“Not really,” and then I saw light. As might be expected, Rena confirmed the point.\n“Cafeteria in courthouse always has business. People must come court and they not want go out. So, they go cafeteria even if not so nice. We are in street. It has also other places. So, I think better make our business really nice. I mean even somebody drive past, he remember and if come one time he want come again. So, we must have nice tables, the doner kebab and many types of coffee and toasted sandwiches. Business can bring in good money. But must wait …”\n“ … be patient …” I muttered.\n“Yes,” she confirmed. “If one months lot of rain business not so good. Even regular customers stay at home. So, we not make much. But never mind: we make more next month when weather good. Like you say, Peter, in business must be patient. But Mr. Vollar not patient. He says if his money stay in bank, he make 7 per cent. So, he draws out money: every month. And he does not work in business and never bring new customers. So, in the end we bust. And Yuri too soft when Mr. Vollar ask for money. He say: ‘To partner must listen’. So, now you understand!”\n“I do. Like all migrants you were under-capitalised …”\n“… yes” she interposed. “We escape with nothing. So, we always short of capital. And overdraft difficult to get from banks.”\n","wordCount":"731","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-07-21T22:13:58+08:00","dateModified":"2025-07-21T22:13:58+08:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/matter-of-opinion/part-4/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Peter Ellinger","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/ accesskey=h title="Peter Ellinger (Alt + H)">Peter Ellinger</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
