  <div class="post-content"><p>At 2.45 p.m., Hannah, Boaz and myself rose as Baruch Shoham took his place at the head of the conference table in his chambers.</p>
<p>“Well,” he said benignly, “I hope everybody had a pleasant lunch?”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Judge,” Hannah assured him on behalf of all present.</p>
<p>“And have you had any discussion  about a suitable figure?”</p>
<p>“We are still rather apart, Judge,” volunteered Hannah. “I believe both parties would like to have your view on the matter.”</p>
<p>“But it would help me greatly to know where you were heading for. It’s  always easier to come up with a reasonable proposal after hearing the parties’ views. Needless  to  say, our discussion in this room is off the record  and  without prejudice. If no agreement is reached, I’ll listen to formal arguments.”</p>
<p>“I  discussed  the subject with my Learned Colleague just before we resumed,” responded  Hannah.  “We  made  a firm offer of  IL18,000.  The  plaintiff  was prepared  to take 26,000. But I think it’s only fair to say that, despite  the substantial gap, both parties remained somewhat flexible.”</p>
<p>“You mean there’s some leeway?”</p>
<p>“Quite so, Judge,” affirmed Boaz.</p>
<p>“That’ll  do,”  said Baruch Shoham. “As it happens, the figure I  am  about  to propose  is within the margin. But before I refer to it I want the parties  to know how I arrived at it. You see, I was most impressed with the plaintiff’s  positive attitude to life. It came across during the  cross-examination about his working technique. Once the  feasibility of working in a sitting posture was demonstrated to him, he confirmed he ought to be  able  to adjust. His main loss is the abrupt termination  of  his  dancing career:  he  had put his heart and soul into to it and his great  dreams  were nipped  in  the  bud.  True,  his  approach  to  life  remains  positive:  his forthcoming move to Be’er Sheva underscores the point. But, as he himself told us, man does not live on bread alone. And I  sympathise. These considerations  led  me, originally, to contemplate an all-in  figure  of  say IL23,000.”</p>
<p>Shoham  stopped for a moment, took his breath, reflected and  then  went on.  “My  assessment underwent a change when I discussed the case  over  lunch with  my Brother Ehood Morag. You will recall that, originally, the  case  had been  assigned to him and so he was quite conversant with the facts.  He is also an avid dancer. Accordingly, he has a special ability to identify with Omri Tal’s predicament. Well, you can gauge my surprise when Ehood Morag took the view that an amateur dancer’s  career  was  usually short  lived. Very few enthusiasts could keep up with their training. In addition, they found their professional career clashing with their hobby.  Morag  further said that, after a while, many amateurs started to  find  dancing somewhat boring. So Omri Tal’s accident resulted in an early termination of  a hobby which might, in any event, have lost its spell sooner or later on  different grounds.  Moreover,  Omri Tal had apparently solved his immediate  problem  by  turning  himself  into a  teacher and  dancing  instructor. In the circumstances, Ehood  Morag opined that  a settlement of some IL17,000 would be just and fair.”</p>
<p>Once  again,  Baruch Shoham broke off, collected  his  thoughts,  leafed quickly through notes he had made during the lunch break and, then, summed up. “After  careful consideration, I concluded that my Brother Morag took a rather  hard line. Undoubtedly, like the rest of us, Omri Tal would one day have to come  to terms with the wear and tear inflicted by time. Still, my own impression, based on the evidence, was that for the time being Omri  Tal would have continued to regard his dancing hobby as a major commitment in  his life. In consequence, I recommend a settlement of an all-in figure of IL21,000.00. May I suggest  that Counsel discuss this proposal  with their respective clients and come back  to me. Shall we resume in 20 minutes?”</p>
<p>“My client, Judge, has decided to accept,” affirmed Boaz when we resumed.</p>
<p>“So does Rotem.”</p>
<p>“So,  the case is settled.” Shoham spoke with satisfaction and,  addressing  me, instructed:  “Mr Berger, will you kindly draw up the agreement and submit  the draft  to  Mr Tamir for approval. I’ll issue my order as soon as I’ve heard from the parties.”</p>
<p>It pleased me that Shoham, the ever tactful and considerate man, had remembered the importance of drawing junior lawyers  into the fold by giving them some role to play. “Thank you, Judge,” I told him.</p>
<p>When we left the chambers, Hannah shook Omri Tal’s hand and wished him all the best.  Rising to the occasion and playing his  part, the one time Valentino invited us to visit him in Be’er Sheva. To my surprise, he added with  a twinkle in his eye: “And please give my warmest regards to Mr Shalom Cohen. We are  looking  forward to seeing him at our wedding. I’ll send  his  invitation care of Boaz.”</p>
