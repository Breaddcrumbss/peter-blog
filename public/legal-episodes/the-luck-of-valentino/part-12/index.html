Most trials were less momentous than the Omri Tal case. Victory  was  secured  by careful  preparation,  sound  tactics  and skilful  arguments.

  <div class="post-content"><p>As  soon as the judge left the Courtroom, Boaz  departed in the company of Omri and his attractive fiancée.  Hannah  left in a hurry, mumbling she  had to report to Ruth Schwartz.  Fearing  David Mizrachi’s eatery would be crowded, I crossed the road to a nearby sandwiches and coffee bar. Munching away, I started to soliloquise about the events of  the morning and about the legal fraternity.</p>
<p>My years with Jacob Keren’s firm convinced me that law  and drama  coincided  mainly  in films and in poorly written books. Undoubtedly, every trial had had  its  tense and often  unpredictable moment. But I had never seen a witness crumbling in the  box and  coming up with a tearful confession. Most trials were less momentous than the Omri Tal case. Victory  was  secured  by careful  preparation,  sound  tactics  and skilful  arguments.  On  many occasions the final result was dictated by sheer luck.</p>
<p>Lawyers,  too,  were  not the Olympian heroes portrayed by writers of fiction. By and large, lawyers fell into three  groups. Just a handful were super stars. The bulk of the  profession  was comprised of practitioners  reasonably  competent  in their chosen  fields. The rest – fortunately a minority –  slogged on notwithstanding their incompetence. Abraham  Kadmon, who had had great expectations in his early days, was a  case in point. Somehow, he managed to hang on despite the steadily increasing number of  his failures in court. Generally, though, useless advocates like him were weeded out by the market when their disappointed clients turned elsewhere.</p>
<p>A competent lawyer did not have to possess outstanding skills. His  tools of trade were  good memory cum concentration and  the ability to assimilate facts and to comprehend and recall the contents of documents. Obviously, the craft of establishing  rapport with court and with witnesses, the gift of repartee  and the ability to think quickly on ones feet were valuable assets. By and  large, though,  these could be  acquired  in the course  of   practice. Colleagues, who had  appeared  hopeless  in their first few cases, often became capable technicians  as  time passed by.</p>
<p>Few of them, though, could rise any higher. Having  observed most of the  super  stars  of  the  older generation,  I  had come to realise that they  were set apart  from  their fellow practitioners by qualities that could not be acquired  by  mere  training  or dedication. These comprised a robust constitution that enabled each of them to carry on when lesser mortals had long exhausted themselves, an uncanny ability to assess a situation effortlessly,  an  ability  to  analyse  legal  points and  a  vivid  imagination. In addition, each of them had a special gift  which was best described as his individual forté.</p>
<p>During  his  years  at the Bar, Ehood Morag had  been  admired  for  his unparalleled  handling  of subtle legal points. His sharp tongue, too,  was a fine asset. Other lawyers feared its lashes. From amongst the current  virtuosos,  Jacob Keren excelled in tactical skills and meticulous  planning. These enabled him to avoid traps and to place smart obstacles to hamper his opponents. Boaz Tamir’s boss, Israel Silver, could not match Jacob  Keren on  those  fronts. But his masterful delivery and his presence  of  mind  were often  just as effective. I had seen him shrugging  off bombshells  which  would have demolished any other lawyer.  Silver used to come up with a convincing  counter reply or move.</p>
<p>I knew, that like most of my contemporaries, I was unlikely to become a courtroom star.  My poor  timing and tendency to get lost in my thoughts compounded my  inadequate manoeuvring  ability when on  my feet. In time, I  should develop  into  a competent  lawyer; that, though, was my limit. Hannah, too, was not  going  to rise  above  the ranks. Her performance in the Omri Tal case  underscored  her faults. Boaz Tamir, in  contrast,  was  a young man of promise. His masterly delivery, excellent rapport with the  judge and his fine tactical skills should in due course compensate for his  somewhat inadequate analytical ability and occasional lapses. With the help of reliable supporting  staff  he  might, in due course, reach the same  standard  as  his current employer.</p>
<p>Wiping my lips after I had drained my cup of coffee, my thoughts  turned to the new leader of my team: Rachel Zeitlin. Instantly, my face brightened: in recent months  she  had become the centre of my life.  I had been captivated  by  her trim  figure, lush hair, self-assured manner and gift of repartee; and  I  was proud  of our fine professional record.  Out of the six cases  we  had  handled since Jacob Keren pronounced us a team, we won five, including three Keren had described as hopeless. And we had settled the remaining one on favourable terms.</p>
<p>We had celebrated our latest victory  in a fashionable restaurant in Jaffa.  Rachel insisted  on settling  the  bill,  left  a generous tip and, with a  twinkle  in  her  eye, observed it was high time she made a man out of me.  She then drove us over to her comfortable flat on Nordau Boulevard.</p>
<p>“A penny for your thoughts,” Boaz’ resonant voice interrupted my daydreaming.</p>
<p>“I was reflecting on an old question, Boaz”, I answered readily. “What  does it take to become a star lawyer?”</p>
<p>“Luck, competence and above all perseverance.”</p>
<p>“Luck and competence are essential; but is perseverance that important?”</p>
<p>“It’s crucial, without it you sink.”</p>
<p>“How about Hannah?”</p>
<p>“She perseveres. But look at her performance this morning: she lacks judgment.”</p>
<p>“And Rachel Zeitlin?” I asked, trying to sound casual.</p>
<p>“I thought you were thinking of her,” grinned Boaz. “Your expression when  you sat  there all on your own told its tale. And, to your,  question,  Rachel will make it with you by her side; not on her own.”</p>
<p>“Why?” I protested, blushing scarlet. “She is always in the lead!”</p>
<p>“But without your pushing, she’d take things easy. Rachel  likes her comforts. And, Eli, she’s not really good when it comes  to legal points.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps; but her delivery is brilliant, and she is not easily rattled.”</p>
<p>“Quite,” agreed Boaz. “But she needs somebody to spur her on and be around when needed; and you love to work with her.”</p>
<p>“How  about  yourself,  Boaz; do you think you’ll make it to the top league?” I thought it best to change  the  subject.  “I’m confident  you can get there; but sometimes I’m not sure if  that’s what you want.”</p>
<p>“Spot on,” smiled Boaz. “And look here, Eli, how much respect and admiration do you feel for our super stars?”</p>
<p>“They are great lawyers!”</p>
<p>“But  do  you enjoy their company? Do you regard any one of them  as  a  model member of our society?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps not; but nobody’s perfect.”</p>
<p>“True. But what’s the point in slogging it out for years, rising at 4  0’clock in the morning to get ready for your next appearance at 9.00 a.m. only to drop onto  your bed, flat out, as soon as you get back home late at night? Is  this the sort of life you aspire to?”</p>
<p>“I  won’t  make it in any event. I’m not  robust and  my  timing  is poor. But you can make it.”</p>
<p>“I made a few booboos today. I don’t know how I let that blasted Omri pull the wool over my eyes on the working method. I made a fool of myself!”</p>
<p>“But  you won’t make that mistake again. And it’s not as if today’s luminaries  were good right from day one.”</p>
<p>“True.  Silver, you may be interested to know, likes to amuse us with  stories of gaffs he made in his early cases.”</p>
<p>“So, you see! And today your performance on the loss of enjoyment of life issue compensated. Actually, how did you work out that bit about the Petidin?”</p>
<p>“I had a spot of luck there,” conceded Boaz. “Baruch Shoham’s bad back  is common  knowledge and I’ve spotted the pill bottles on his desk.  I put  two and two together.”</p>
<p>“And the Dr Levi business? Did you send Omri to him?”</p>
<p>“Off the record and between friends?”</p>
<p>“Sure!”</p>
<p>“Well,  I met Levi in the army. He handled the case of a trooper of  mine  who busted his knee in training. Levi’s  a fine doctor and knows how to relate to difficult patients. And like all GPs with an interest in psychiatry  he’s  a good man when you need some &hellip; unorthodox arrow to your bow!”</p>
<p>“Brilliant!”</p>
<p>“But, still off the record, you suspected something was wrong?”</p>
<p>“Still  talking in confidence – so did Jacob Keren!”</p>
<p>“But Hannah Hod refused to listen. She had to lead with her chin to prove she was Miss Know All. That – in a nutshell – is why she’ll never make it! But enough of that. We’ve  got  to talk about the case. Have you given any further thought to a settlement?”</p>
<p>“You better have a word with Hannah. I’m sure she’s discussed the matter  with Ruth Schwartz during the break!”</p>
