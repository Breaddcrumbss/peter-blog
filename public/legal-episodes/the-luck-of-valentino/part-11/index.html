  <div class="post-content"><p>Some  three weeks after our conference with Keren, Hannah and I  marched over to our dilapidated court building.  Boaz  looked well and at ease. In contrast, Omri Tal, who was sitting  next  to  him, appeared  nervous,  even apprehensive. He was talking in  undertone  with  the singularly attractive girl, who was doing her best to calm him down.</p>
<p>“Glad  to  see  everybody’s  on deck,” said  Baruch  Shoham,  having  responded graciously when all of us rose to our feet and bowed as he entered the  court room  from his chambers. Unlike the attorneys, who continued to  wear  gowns, the judge’s formal attire comprised a black silk jacket, a white shirt with  a stiff collar and a sober tie.</p>
<p>“And  you,  Mr Tamir,” Shoham  added as he relaxed in his  comfortable  leather chair,  “look much better! You must have followed your doctor’s orders  to  the letter! And  it is good to have the privilege of seeing you again in the ranks,  Frau Hod. I feared that Rotem’s gain might be our loss of your spirited appearances before us!”</p>
<p>“No  such luck, Your Honour. I’ll continue to be a thorn in  the flesh of the courts for years to come, whenever Rotem sounds the all clear!”</p>
<p>Everybody,  including  the Judge, guffawed. Then all of  us  turned  our attention  to the papers in front of us. Shoham went through his file deftly, as persons do when they are in command of the contents. When he had  collected his thoughts, he cleared his throat and addressed both sides: “I take it neither party wishes to raise any objections to, or queries  about, Dr. Alon Shaked’s medical report. It strikes me as very clear and meticulous.”</p>
<p>“Both parties found it most helpful,” confirmed Boaz.</p>
<p>“So, you have discussed it amongst yourselves?”</p>
<p>“We have indeed. The defendants agree that, at this  stage, it is impossible to state with certainty whether or not the plaintiff&rsquo;s injury is permanent. The prognosis is that some disability will remain.”</p>
<p>“I  too read the report in this way,” conceded Shoham. “Can we then proceed  on this basis? Are the parties ad idem to this extent?”</p>
<p>”We are,” confirmed  Boaz.  “We are, further,  agreed  that,  as Dr. Shaked concludes, the permanent impairment will not be major.”</p>
<p>“Very  well,  then. So, unless either party wishes  to  raise  a preliminary point, you, Mr. Tamir, can commence with your opening.”</p>
<p>For the next half hour, I listened attentively to Boaz’s meticulous  statement of the plaintiff’s case. As often before, I admired his delivery which was  as elegant,  as  clear  and as well balanced as any address  delivered  by  Jacob Keren.  What impressed me even more was the subtle manner in which he  adapted his  speech to suit the temperament and orientation of  the Judge.  Had  he appeared  before Ehood Morag,  Boaz would, undoubtedly, have included  prolific  references  to  recent  cases, incorporating here and there a  pun  on  some clumsy  expression  in  a  judgment cited by  him.  In Baruch Shoham’s court he covered, assiduously, each and every issue, leaving no corner unturned.</p>
<p>It  was only when he came close to the end that, as I  had  anticipated, Boaz  made a slip. Turning in the direction of Omri Tal, who was listening  to him spell bound, Boaz became eloquent: “So,  Your Honour, my client’s dream of becoming a  household  name amongst dancing fans in Israel has come to an abrupt end! True, his  permanent handicap may not be major. Still, he will never leave the dancing floor again as the holder of the trophy awarded for any fast moving dance. True, social dancing, as well as a mediocre performance as an amateur chess player, remain within his reach. But he can no longer hope to become Israel’s undisputed Valentino.  His aspirations  for success will now be confined to his professional career as  a dental technician and even there he will have to cope with a handicap!”</p>
<p>“But  Your  Honour,”  Hannah had risen to her  feet,  “doesn’t  this  argument suggest  that, in the ultimate, the plaintiff’s shattered dream  will  have a beneficial  effect on his career? According to the argument just raised,  work will  become his main solace! Isn’t this fresh motivation bound to  drive  him from strength to strength in his profession!”</p>
<p>“The point occurred to me,” observed Shoham. “But how about the adverse  effect of his injury?”</p>
<p>“This question  is  in  issue, Your Honour. May we revert to it later on?”</p>
<p>“Very  well,”  said  Shoham  complacently. It  was,  however,  clear from his expression  that  the arrow  had found its mark.  Boaz  frowned,  bestowed  a searching  glance on his client and, for just a second, remained lost  in  his thoughts. He then turned back to his notes and brought his address to a  swift conclusion.</p>
<p>“Thanks  for this very comprehensive and clear address,” said  Shoham  benignly when  Boaz finished. “Could you please furnish a copy of your address? I’m  sure  our  notes  are accurate but we can’t be  too  careful!”   He  was, implicitly, eluding to a problem that had plagued all Israeli courts in  those remote  days. In the absence of sound equipment, judges and  their  associates had  to  take  copious  notes  of everything  said  in  court,  including  the attorneys’ speeches and the testimony. The parties too kept  records.  Usually each entrusted the work to a pupil or a secretary and, at the end of each day, the respective ‘notes of proceedings’ were compared and reconciled. In lengthy trials,  the process was cumbersome. Court stenographers were, as yet, a rarity.</p>
<p>“I  note that the defendants are not calling witnesses but have  reserved  the right to call evidence in rebuttal,” observed Shoham.</p>
<p>“Judging  from  the opening, I don’t think  the  need  will arise,” answered Hannah.</p>
<p>Shoham  let  his satisfaction  show:  “So we can take things easy. It’s only  10.45. Let’s  have a 20 minutes break. We can  all  do with a cup of coffee and the smokers with a cigarette!”</p>
<p>When the proceedings resumed, Boaz put Omri Tal in the box. As was the  custom, the first, highly neutral and  uncontroversial  questions,  were asked  mainly  in order to put the witness, who was  fidgeting  nervously,  at ease.  To this end, Boaz invited Omri to tell us about his forthcoming  move  to Be’er  Sheva and, generally, about his plans for the future. As soon  as  Omri had regained his composure, Boaz turned to the relevant issue. Cutting himself short on the liability issue, which was no longer in dispute,  he  asked  a series  of questions about Omri’s injuries and their effect on his work  as  a dental  technician. He also established the extent of Omri’s past losses  and laid  the foundation for the argument respecting the loss of future  earnings. Watching  the two of them carefully, I surmised that Boaz had not put the 20 minutes break to good use: he still believed that a dental technician had  to do his work standing on his feet.</p>
<p>Boaz’s  questions became more articulate when he turned to Omri’s loss  of enjoyment  of life. In response to his carefully phrased questions, Omri  told us  all  about  the  pleasure and pride he had experienced  when  he  won  his trophies  and  about  his aspirations to become Israel’s  best  known  amateur dancing  champion.  Omri readily conceded that, even after  the  accident,  he continued  to play an active role in his club as an instructor and  guide  and that  he  stepped onto the parquet floor when they  organised  social  dancing evenings.  These  experiences,  though,  were  a  poor  compensation  for  the irreparable  loss he had suffered when his great expectations came to such  an abrupt end.</p>
<p>“I have not lost my hope for the future,” Omri Tal affirmed as the examination-in-chief  drew to its close. “But, whenever I  think  of  how  I performed on the floor before this stupid accident, I feel drained – empty.”</p>
<p>“No further questions,” said Boaz and resumed his seat on the front bench.</p>
<p>“It’s  too early to break,” observed Baruch Shoham. “But I suspect  your  cross-examination  will  take us well into the afternoon, Frau Hod.  And  how  about evidence in rebuttal?”</p>
<p>“Barring  unexpected surprises we’ll do without such evidence. And I may be able to finish just before lunch  if we break, say, at 1.00 p.m. or so?”</p>
<p>“That  suits me,” nodded Shoham. “Actually, I have a late luncheon  engagement.  Let’s  agree to break at about 13.00 hours. You can carry  on after the break if need be.”</p>
<p>As  was  the norm amongst lawyers trained by Keren,  Hannah skimmed through her notes leisurely, straightened her gown and kept frowning. After a while, Omri Tal’s self-assured manner underwent a subtle  change.  He started to fidget and, once again, looked ill at ease.</p>
<p>“Well,  Mr  Tal,”  Hannah  went  straight to the  point,  “so  this …  not particularly substantial accident will stop you from rising to the top of your professional career?”</p>
<p>“If  You Honour pleases,” Boaz was up on his feet, “this is a loaded  question. Is  my Learned Colleague asking whether the accident was substantial or does she want to know whether it will impede the  development  of  my  client’s career?”</p>
<p>“Let  me then rephrase the question,” Hannah smiled tightly. “Mr. Tal,  will  the accident,  the subject of this case, stop you from rising to the top  of  your professional career?”</p>
<p>“The injury has slowed me down frightfully!”</p>
<p>“And why is that?”</p>
<p>“Because  I  can’t stand on my feet for any length of time. My knee  gets  too painful and my leg feels uncomfortable!” Boaz’s intervention had helped Omri to regain some of his self-assurance.</p>
<p>“And a dental technician has to do his work on his feet?”</p>
<p>“That’s the way I used to work before the accident!”</p>
<p>“Please answer my question: does a dental technician have to stand on his feet at work! To make myself even clearer: can’t he work in a sitting posture?”</p>
<p>“My client is not here as an expert witness,” Boaz was up again, trying hard to hide his anxiety. “How can he testify about the work of a dental technician in general?”</p>
<p>“Does my Learned Colleague suggest he himself is unable to testify about the work of ‘a lawyer’?” Hannah asked sweetly.</p>
<p>Baruch Shoham smiled and, instantly, gazed awkwardly at an  unidentified point  in front of his desk. Boaz, in turn, started to make a  reply,  thought better of it, shrugged and sat down.</p>
<p>“Well, Mr. Tal: won’t you enlighten us?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know how other technicians work!” Omri protested, glancing  anxiously in Boaz’s direction.</p>
<p>“Don’t you know Mr Joseph Cohen – the Dental Technician at 56 Herzl Street? I believe he is the Honorary Treasurer of your Organisation?”</p>
<p>“I’ve met him!”</p>
<p>“Does he have any handicap?”</p>
<p>“Really, Your Honour! Where does all this lead us?” Boaz rushed in.</p>
<p>“I’d  better make myself clearer then,” Hannah raised her voice. “Did  you,  Mr Tal, notice that Mr. Cohen is a paraplegic, confined to a wheelchair!”</p>
<p>“I know,” agreed Omri cowed.</p>
<p>“And what is his reputation like?”</p>
<p>“Second to none,” conceded Omri. “But I only said that I am used to doing my work standing on my feet.”</p>
<p>“But, if necessary, such work can be carried out even from a wheelchair!”</p>
<p>“I don’t know how?” Omri was cornered but, bravely, tried to stand his ground.</p>
<p>“Well, let us see,” said Hannah.</p>
<p>For the next thirty minutes, Hannah cross-examined Omri meticulously  on each phase and detail in the work of dental technicians. When she finished, it was evident that, with some adjustments and reorganisation of the workstations on  the premises, all processes  and  procedures  could  be carried out by a technician sitting at a workbench. She proceeded quickly, without pulling her punches, but at the same time kept glancing at Shoham  to ensure he was  able  to  keep notes. Using one  of the few minutes of respite to steal a glance around me, I  caught  the immobile expression that had descended on Boaz’s face. A few minutes later, I was taken aback by the hostile glance he bestowed on his wriggling client.</p>
<p>At  long last, Omri threw in the towel. Mopping  the  sweat off his brow, he confirmed: “Well,  yes,  I  suppose that, in due course, I’ll learn how to  work from a chair. It’s not the way I was trained but, well, beggars can’t be choosers.”</p>
<p>“Come, come, Mr. Tal,” urged Hannah. “Don’t tell us you won’t be able to  earn a living that way!”</p>
<p>“It&rsquo;ll slow me down!”</p>
<p>“By how much?”</p>
<p>“Quite a bit during the first few months!”</p>
<p>“But, say, during the next five years?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps 15 per cent?”</p>
<p>“And over 10 years?”</p>
<p>“Ten per cent or perhaps even less. I suppose I’ll get used to it.”</p>
<p>“So  a  10 per cent  loss of future earnings over ten years is as much as we have to contemplate. As you are young and adjustable it might even be less than that!”</p>
<p>“It might,” Omri conceded.</p>
<p>Smoothing her gown over again, Hannah whispered to me: “O.K. on the earnings? Start on the dancing?”</p>
<p>“Fine on the earning; but go slow on the dancing. He volunteered he’s not lost his hopes for the future. I smell a rat!”</p>
<p>“Let’s  see.” Drunk with the success of the last half hour, she turned  back to the cowed Omri Tal. Like a matador brandishing his sword  in the face of an exhausted bull, she got ready for the kill.</p>
<p>“Let’s  now  turn to your alleged loss of enjoyment of life, Mr  Tal.  By  all accounts you were a gifted amateur dancer!”</p>
<p>“I  was;  and I could have ended right at the top.” Omri  regained some of his spirit.</p>
<p>“But there are no certainties?”</p>
<p>“True; but my record speaks for itself!”</p>
<p>“But could you have kept training as assiduously as needed while your practice developed?”</p>
<p>“Dancing  was first priority!” Lifting my head from my note pad, I  spotted  a smiling Boaz, who gave me a roguish wink when our eyes met.</p>
<p>“So, your accident, regrettable as it has been,  may  have had a positive effect on your career!”</p>
<p>“Man doesn’t live on bread alone!” was the pointed reply.</p>
<p>“But it’s good to have plenty of it!”</p>
<p>“I agree,” countered Omri, regaining the composure he had displayed during  the examination-in- chief.  “Sometimes I can’t concentrate on my work because  I keep thinking of my lost dancing career!”</p>
<p>“But isn’t time a great healer? Won’t you come to terms with life in time?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think I ever will. I’ve tried to put my dancing career  behind me. I’ve done my best  to forget about it. I’ve really tried.  But every time I watch others perform  on the floor, I feel empty, hollow, out of place! I’m like a singer who lost  his voice!”  He  had  pronounced the last few words intently, fervently.  I knew that  Boaz’s  skilful tutelage might have fine tuned Omri’s script. All the same, Omri’s sentiments carried conviction.</p>
<p>“But despite your frustrations you go to your club once or twice a week?”</p>
<p>“So as not to be cut off altogether!”</p>
<p>“And let’s face it: you do dance!”</p>
<p>“Only  when  we  have social evenings; and only  slow  moving,  old  fashioned dances!”</p>
<p>“But,”  Hannah brandished  one  of  Joseph  Almog’s  reports, “sometimes you keep going for two or even three hours.”</p>
<p>“I do, although it ain’t easy!”</p>
<p>“But how???”</p>
<p>“I take pain killers on each occasion!”</p>
<p>“Pain killers? Do you mean an aspirin?”</p>
<p>“Something stronger than that,” muttered Omri, looking injured.</p>
<p>“Like what?” intervened Baruch Shoham.</p>
<p>“I take Petidin, You Honour,” confessed Omri.</p>
<p>“Petidin,” Shoham was aghast. “That&rsquo;s an opiate, Mr. Tal. How do you get access to that?”</p>
<p>“My G.P., Dr. Levi, prescribes it!”</p>
<p>“Your  G.P.!?” Shoham was leaning over his desk, looking at the young man  in the  witness box with unconcealed concern and alarm. “What on earth is  he  up to?  Petidin is a heavy-duty drug, to be taken on rare  occasions  when  the patient  experiences acute, uncontrollable, pain like in the early phase of  a badly slipped disk! Petidin should not be prescribed regularly!”</p>
<p>“I  think  this  is why Dr. Levi gives me only enough for  two  days  a  week,” explained Omri. “He has refused, flatly, to give me any more or to increase the dosage.”</p>
<p>“But  why does he give it to you at all?” Shoham persevered. “Why  doesn’t  he prescribe something milder - less addictive?”</p>
<p>“He tried; but it didn’t work.”</p>
<p>“So why didn’t he tell you to stop dancing,  at least for a while?”</p>
<p>“We  tried  but I was getting terribly depressed. I couldn’t work or eat and didn’t even want to see my friends.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t he send you to a psychiatrist?” Hannah stepped in adroitly.</p>
<p>“Dr.  Levi  practises  also  as a psychiatrist,” said  Omri  lamely,  whilst  I bestowed  an  admiring glance on my friend Boaz who was  smirking  contentedly.</p>
<p>“But  then,”  asked  Hannah  unthinkingly,  “why  doesn’t  Dr.  Levi  prescribe medicines to help you to overcome your handicap at work?”</p>
<p>“But, Frau Hod,” Baruch Shoham stepped in urbanely. “We&rsquo;ve just been told  that Dr.  Levi  prescribed  the drug in moderation. I can tell  you,  from  my  own experience,  how  dangerous it is. I used it when my back gave way  some  four years ago. I needed Dr. Shaked’s help to kick it off before it  was too  late. Oh no – we don’t want our young generation to be turned  into  drug addicts.” Shuffling through his  notes for  a few seconds, he turned back to Omri Tal: “But, Mr Tal, why  didn’t  you mention the problem to Dr. Shaked.”</p>
<p>“Actually, I did.”</p>
<p>“You did? Oh yes &hellip; so this explains Dr. Shaked’s reference to your having to use  pain  killers  from time to time. Well, yes, I take the  point.  And  you better ask Dr. Levi to refer you back to Dr Shaked for a further opinion about the  medication.  Two views are better than one!” Turning  to  Hannah,  Baruch Shoham  said:  “But  I really shouldn’t take the thunder out of your  cross-examination. The floor is yours! Please do continue!”</p>
<p>Looking  forlorn, Hannah mechanically smoothed her gown over once  again and  looked at me anxiously. She was as deflated as Omri had  appeared at the end of the first phase of her cross examination.</p>
<p>“Get  him  to confirm he’s still looking forward to the future and  ask  about Be’er  Sheva. We’ve got nothing to lose there,” I whispered.</p>
<p>“Thanks,” she muttered and turned back to the self assured Omri who was purring contentedly.</p>
<p>“Well,  Mr Tal,” she said in a conciliatory tone, “but despite the  regrettable accident you do have your hopes for the future.”</p>
<p>“I do. I’ve already said so.”</p>
<p>“So, your attitude to life has remained positive!”</p>
<p>“It has; it has to be; if you don’t keep your head high everybody tramples all over you.”</p>
<p>“So, in the long run, you will try to remain a valuable member of society?”</p>
<p>“I shall indeed!”</p>
<p>“And  so the accident has not marred your hopes. It has not taken the  joy  of life away from you altogether?” asked Hannah.</p>
<p>“It hasn’t,” conceded Omri readily.</p>
<p>“And you are looking forward to your move to Be’er  Sheva?”</p>
<p>“I do!”</p>
<p>“How about your departure from your club in Ramat Gan?” asked Hannah, whilst I caught my breath. The answer could, easily, turn the tables on us once  again. Omri, though, remained positive: “We have already founded a new club in Be’er Sheva. I’ve been voted President and Chief Instructor.”</p>
<p>“I  am  sure all of us wish you success and  satisfaction!”  congratulated Baruch Shoham.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t agree more,” affirmed Hannah, back to her ebullient self. Taking in my gesture, she added: “No further questions, Your Honour.”</p>
<p>“Any re-examination, Mr Tamir?” asked Shoham, giving the side that called  the witness the chance to repair any damage done in the cross-examination.</p>
<p>“None, Your Honour.”</p>
<p>“Thank you Mr. Tal; you are excused,” said Baruch Shoham, indicating that  Omri Tal’s ordeal was over.</p>
<p>“This is the plaintiff&rsquo;s case,” announced Boaz, indicating he was not calling any further witnesses.</p>
<p>“The defence is not calling  witnesses” advised Hannah.</p>
<p>“So  you&rsquo;ll  have the last word. Well, it’s 12.45. So  I suggest you, Mr. Tamir, address us when we reconvene after lunch.”</p>
<p>“Actually,”  said  Hannah,  “our  firm waives the right to  speak  last  in  all accident cases we defend. So, if Your Honour pleases, I shall speak first.”</p>
<p>“That’s very decent,” countered Boaz. “But, actually, Your Honour, the  parties had  earlier  on  considered asking you to suggest a settlement.  As  all  the evidence is now on record, I wonder if this might perhaps be a good time?”</p>
<p>“It would, rather,” agreed Hannah.</p>
<p>“In that case, I suggest we reconvene in my Chambers at, say, 14.45. This will give  the parties adequate time to get instructions and will enable me  to  go over my notes.”</p>
