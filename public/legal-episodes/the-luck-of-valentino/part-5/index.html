      Part 5: My Friendship with Boaz

  <div class="post-content"><p>As  we  walked out, Boaz heaved a sigh of relief. “Ehood Morag gives  me  a  headache. He  has  a  knack  of complicating simple points!”</p>
<p>“Don’t you think his analysis of our case is  right? Isn’t Morag brilliant?”</p>
<p>“He is; but only in a narrow field,” conceded Boaz. “But  he is unbending and makes no allowances once he steers a course. Judges like  him forget  they  deal  with  human  problems:  not  with  philosophical arguments!”</p>
<p>“I don’t think he is narrow,” I muttered.</p>
<p>“The way you step up to his defence after doing your best to put  him  down! You do admire him, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“I suppose I do.”</p>
<p>“How about his rotten performance in his commercial law course. You  showed him up there!”</p>
<p>“It ain’t his field, Boaz!”</p>
<p>“That’s  what I am getting at. A man with his ability should have  spent  some time in the library and prepared a decent series of lectures. He is up to it!”</p>
<p>“Of  course  he is.  His commercial law course   was disappointing. Perhaps he was too busy?”</p>
<p>“No, Eli, he was too bloody arrogant. It’s the same in his other activities. Take his interest in philosophy: he has read every scrap  of paper  written by writers he likes. But he ‘can’t  be bothered’  to  read Kant. I’m told it’s the  same in  the  dancing club. He sticks to Waltz and Tango, which he says are civilised. You won’t get him to try a Polka. Sheer arrogance and narrow mindedness!”</p>
<p>“Oh  well, we’ll have to agree to disagree,” I gave in, knowing in my heart of hearts that Boaz was a better judge of human nature than myself.</p>
<p>Soon we reached the small lane leading to David Mizrachi’s eatery. “Are you free for lunch?” I asked Boaz. Noting the change in  his expression,  I  added  in haste: “It’s a treat – Keren gave  a  bonus  to  all of us.”</p>
<p>Boaz  and  I  relished  the succulent Shashlik and Kebabs, the marinated  eggplants and the Pitas dipped into the delicious Humus.  As  we  kept indulging  in  small  talk, I recalled our days at the  Hebrew  University  in Jerusalem.  Despite his shock of black hair, his broad shoulders and his  tall figure,  Boaz was too heavy set to be considered good looking. All the  same, women were fascinated by the twinkle in his eye, by his easy going manner,  by his  confident  airs  and by his carefree demeanour. Many of us felt envy as he appeared, on many an evening, walking down fashionable King George Street with his arm around  one attractive girl or another. All of them, though, turned out to be temporary companions. Boaz had his fun, showed his appreciation  but preserved his freedom and independence.</p>
<p>After  he  graduated,  Boaz  Tamir  left Jerusalem  and  joined Israel Silver’s renowned law firm in Tel Aviv.  One morning, I received  an  invitation  to  his wedding. The lucky girl was Miriam Dagan, a relief teacher who spent a term in a left-wing secondary school in Tel Aviv on secondment from Kibbutz Yokneam.</p>
<p>When I saw her, I opened my eyes wide. The bride was not the type of easy going, light hearted,  glamour girl we used to associate with the lady’s killer of Jerusalem.  She struck me as a caring, self assured, dependable and  warm hearted  woman,  whose beauty lay in her character and outlook  on  life.  Her plain looks did not detract from the impact left by her personality and by her warm, dark brown, eyes.</p>
<p>“So  you  are  Eli,” she said when I called on them a few weeks after their wedding. “Boaz never stops talking  about  your  days  in Jerusalem.”</p>
<p>“Hopefully he told you only good things, Miriam,” I said lamely.</p>
<p>“Please,  call me Miri – all my friends  do. And I’m sure there are only  good things to tell,” she answered with a smile that transformed her face.</p>
<p>“I hope I’ll live up to your expectations,” I said, starting to feel at home.</p>
<p>Miri had prepared an excellent meal. In response to my compliments  she revealed  how she had picked the art up from her mother. Long before the family migrated to Palestine, Mrs. Dagan (Kornfeld  in  those days)  had run a table d&rsquo;hote in Prague. It was only natural that she was  put in charge of her Kibbutz’s communal kitchen and dining room, with a small staff under her command. Over the years, she passed her culinary skills on to her eager daughter, teaching her also how to put any available foodstuffs to their  best use. The meal we enjoyed that evening proved that Miri had been a good  pupil. The  stuffed  cabbage  rolls,  served with a tangy  tomato  sauce,  the  mixed vegetables and the  potatoes with parsley were delicious. Unable to resist, I  accepted  two  extra  helpings. Miri’s  eyes  danced  with merriment.</p>
<p>Then, to my dismay, I felt the first  wheeze  and  the asthmatic’s dreaded sense of choking. Trying awkwardly to conceal my inhaler in my  palm, I  took  two puffs and, to my relief, found that the tight  discomfort  in  my chest was abating.</p>
<p>“How  long  have  you  suffered from it?” asked Miri. Boaz,  who  knew  I  was reticent on the subject, looked at me with unease. Miri’s directness,  though, had disarmed me.</p>
<p>“Since I was a boy of 4 or 5, Miri. It started after a bout of pneumonia I got when we were refugees in France.”</p>
<p>“I had asthma when I was a child,” she volunteered. “I grew out of it in my teens. And you, Eli, should not take things that can bring it on, like sweet wine. There’s nothing to be  embarrassed  about: you can be sure people understand.”  Discreet  Boaz looked at her reproachfully. I, though, was not offended:  Miri  had  spoken sincerely  and  her words  made sense. Smiling at both of them, I  thought  to myself  that Fortuna had been at her gracious best when she brought  Boaz  and Miri together.</p>
<p>During  the  next  two  years I spent many  a  happy  evening  in  their comfortable flat in North Tel Aviv, with its pleasant glimpses of the  Yarkon river. Boaz  was rising fast in Israel Silver’s office and Miri coped well  with  her two  careers:  the meticulous housewife and the model schoolteacher.  To  the regret  of  all  their friends, the atmosphere of  solid  well  being  changed thereafter.  Miri, who was a few years older than Boaz and who  was  concerned about her maternal age, decided to start a family. For a while Boaz  resisted: he was blissfully happy with her and satisfied with his career. He craved  for no permutation. In the end, though, he gave way.</p>
<p>Miri had a difficult pregnancy. The worried look that often crept over Boaz’s face was a source of concern to all  his  friends. Fortunately,  he did not allow his personal problems to affect his  work.  On occasions,  though,  he  appeared close to breaking point. As  time  went  on, calling  on  them became an ordeal. Miri continued to shower  her  hospitality when a guest turned up. To our dismay, she  often rushed down  the three flights of stairs leading to their flat to get some sweetmeats or  soft drinks from the grocer on the corner. Like  other friends, I concluded it  was best to keep away for a while.</p>
<p>Matters  took a turn for the better when little Ruthi  arrived.  Leaving the  dining  room  at the Kibbutz in charge of her second in  command,  Miri’s mother came down to Tel Aviv to help her daughter out. Miri recovered in  no time and was again able to welcome guests with the ease of earlier days.  Once again,  many of us flocked to their home.  This happy state was not  disrupted by Miri’s second pregnancy which went well. Unfortunately, she took things too lightly, carrying on her full-time job until, one sad morning, she had to  be rushed to hospital. To everyone’s relief, the episode ended without a tragedy: Miri  recovered after a few weeks. But  baby  Benjamin,  who  had  arrived prematurely,  remained undersize and sickly. After a number of heavy head  and chest  cold,  he  had  his first attack  of  asthma.  Despite  the  favourable diagnosis of two paediatricians and the care lavished on him by his parents, he was unable to shake it off.</p>
<p>Benjamin&rsquo;s  condition  led to a  turning point in the  Tamir’s fortunes.  Determined to nurse her son back to health, Miri resigned her job  and, before  long,  the  loss  of her  salary  triggered    financial  problems. Eventually,  their house loan fell into arrears. Although the bank  agreed  to reinstate  it and to extend the repayment period,  the interest rate  applied to  the new package was considerably higher than that charged  originally. In consequence, the reduction of the monthly instalments was smaller  than  the Tamirs  had anticipated. Occasionally, Miri was able to help keep their  heads above  water  by giving private tuition. But more often than  not,  they  were short of cash.</p>
<p>Thoughts of the problems faced by the Tamirs kept roving through my mind during the sumptuous repast in David Mizrachi’s eatery. I was,  further, reflecting  on  the  strong  friendship that bound me to the Tamirs on  the individual level but, at the very same time, did not stop me from resorting to every  legitimate  trick  when Boaz and I were  pitched  against  one  another professionally.  I knew that Jacob Keren had a similar relationship  with  his two arch rivals. To function properly within the rules: all of us had to drive a wedge between the personal and the professional worlds in which we existed. Those who lost sight, or who confused the issues, usually came  to grief.</p>
<p>“A penny for your thoughts, Eli,” I heard Boaz chuckle.</p>
<p>“Our life philosophy: the lawyer’s need to separate the personal from the professional. Is it wholesome?”</p>
<p>“You mean: is it sensible?”</p>
<p>“I had rather ask:  isn’t it perverse?”</p>
<p>“I  don’t think it is,” said Boaz after a reflective pause. “When you handle  a case, or negotiate a deal, you act for your client:  you look after his interests. You can’t allow your friendship  for  the other party or his representative to interfere. But once that  matter is  settled,  we  function  as individuals.  The client’s dealings must not be allowed to affect us on that plane.”</p>
<p>“I  suppose  you  are  right. But  sometimes  the  boundaries  get obliterated!”</p>
<p>“Quite,”  agreed  Boaz  dryly. “Like when you use someone else’s style and standard letters as a camouflage!”</p>
<p>“You think that’s going too far?” I asked, mortified.</p>
<p>“Borderline,” Boaz comforted me. “But pinching your friend’s notes just before he gets up for his opening is a different matter altogether!”</p>
<p>“I can’t imagine any one of us stooping that low!”</p>
<p>“I  am  told it has happened.”</p>
<p>For a while we gossiped about old friends and new acquaintances. Then,  at  long  last,  I assumed the courage to ask about Miri and Benjamin.</p>
<p>“Miri&rsquo;s  O.K., Eli. But Benji is no better. Sometimes I wish Miri didn’t  drag him  from one doctor to another. The bills accumulate but the medicines do  him  no good – no good at all.”</p>
<p>“You  ought to put a stop to it, Boaz. I’ve been through it when I was a  boy. Usually, these specialists  are just a bunch of sharks – sharks and quacks!”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you tell Miri when you come over next? And, coming to think of  it, we haven’t seen you for some time.”</p>
<p>“I’ve  been  shuttling between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.  Some legal points turn on the Turkish Land Law. Some  materials are available only in Jerusalem.”</p>
<p>As we were getting  ready to leave, Boaz reverted to the Omri Tal matter.  “Eli, we should really spend some time on the liability issue. Is fifty -fifty agreeable?”</p>
<p>“I’m pretty sure it is. I’ll have to check with Hannah; but I see no  problem. Off the record, it’s the very figure she had in mind.”</p>
<p>“Shall I drop you a line to this effect?” asked Boaz.</p>
<p>“Please do. I’m quite certain we won’t haggle on this point. The actual sum is something different!”</p>
<p>“Very well,” said Boaz, taking hold of his briefcase.</p>
<p>“But before we go, Boaz, thanks for saving the situation in Morag’s chambers.”</p>
<p>“Don’t mention it, Eli. And you must not let Jacob Keren put you up to such ruses. It’s one thing to parry with a chap like  Morag. I suspect he enjoys it if he gives as  good  as  he takes. Tricking him into an outburst with a  view to getting him off a case is a different matter altogether: he would have never forgiven you.”</p>
<p>“Did he know what I was up to?”</p>
<p>“Hard to tell. If he was, he also knew Keren was behind it. In any event,  you handled him well later on. So the episode is closed. But don’t you ever  again let Keren use you as a pawn! I suppose he’d express regrets if you came to  grief. But he won’t lift a finger to help! A chap like him never does!”</p>
<p>“Are they all like that, Boaz?”</p>
<p>“Some may be smoother – less obvious. But they are of the same mould. It’s a harsh world, Eli!”</p>
<p>“Are we, too, going to end up like them?” I asked after a pause.</p>
<p>“I fear we may. It’s the price of success  at our game. All leading lawyer have worked their ways up through the ranks. They had their own ideals as young men and, even today, observe legal  ethics and the norms of honesty and  good behaviour.  We must concede that they are honourable and righteous men! Still, they have taught themselves to play hard and fast within the  accepted parameters.  As  long as they ‘act lawfully’, they  are  not  pricked  by conscience or bothered by any consideration for others!”</p>
<p>“And we too may end up like them,” I said sadly. “After all, even now we enjoy the games we play in court and out of it.”</p>
<p>“Quite. And  see you soon in  our  place.  Ruthi  has  been clamouring  for  her  Uncle Eli. But please don’t bring  her  chocolates.  She breaks into a rash the next morning!”</p>
