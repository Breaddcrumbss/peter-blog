  <div class="post-content"><p>Omri  Tal  saw  Dr. Alon Shaked before the end of the  month.  When  the medical report was in, I convened the firm’s pre-trial ‘conference’, chaired by Jacob Keren in person. Shortly before the appointed hour, Hannah Hod slipped into  my  office. She  looked invigorated, had put on weight and, to my delight, had  taken  the trouble to make herself up.</p>
<p>“And how are you, Eli? I hear you have moved up in the world?”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>“Oh,  I am not suggesting you got a promotion. I am no longer a party to  such little secrets. But I’m told that you have  risen  high  in  the esteem of one Rachel Zeitlin, although she won’t go  to  another dance with you unless and until she finds a pair of steel framed shoes!”</p>
<p>“I did  tread  on her toes once or twice,” I  admitted  shamefacedly.  “But  I thought that even so she enjoyed the evening?”</p>
<p>“I’m sure she did. But I suspect she prefers to take you to  the opera, the Philharmonic Orchestra, Habimah, cinemas, posh restaurants and let me not guess where else!”</p>
<p>“Hannah!!!”</p>
<p>“Calm down, Eli: my motto is: ‘live and let live’. But, seriously,  you better take care not to cross the point of no return blindfolded!”</p>
<p>“Rachel  and  I have a good working relationship,” I stated lamely. “But  I  do like to go out with her – she is fun.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad you enjoy her company. How do you find her as a lawyer?”</p>
<p>“She  is a fine courtroom advocate.” Indeed, Rachel could be as aggressive a cross-examiner as Hannah but also knew when to pull her punches or opt for a tactical retreat.</p>
<p>“But don’t you have to do some of her thinking for her?”</p>
<p>“She’s not an Ehood Morag on points of law.”</p>
<p>“So, you may complement one another. Well, then,  best of  luck to both of you. But now we better trot over to Jacob Keren’s  office. He won’t appreciate being kept waiting!”</p>
<p>“Nice  to see you again, Hannah. And how do you find your new post?” Keren,  I noticed,  looked  at peace with the world. His ruddy  complexion  and  relaxed expression  attested that his spell in the Greek Islands had agreed with him. Just for once, he appeared to be at the top of the world.</p>
<p>“I’m fine, Mr. Keren. And you look splendid. Well, what do you think of our present matter?” Hannah pressed ahead.</p>
<p>“Joseph  Almog’s reports confirm that Valentino is back on the dancing floor. But  dear Omri  restricts himself to social dancing. And Dr. Shaked  thinks this is all he’ll be able to manage for the time being. So  it seems  to me we better to crush his claim for loss of future earnings and  settle the loss of enjoyment of life claim. Omri is getting  married, has  the courage to plan a move to Be’er Sheva and, generally, shows no  signs of  becoming  a  social  pariah or a dejected recluse. I  think  that settlement for  an  amount  of IL18,000.00 sounds reasonable. What do you think, Hannah?”</p>
<p>“I  still  want to tackle him on both counts. I know that our Omri  won’t  win another  Rumba trophy. But Almog’s reports show he continues to enjoy  a  full life: so, isn’t his ‘loss of enjoyment of life’ nominal?”</p>
<p>“Eli?” asked Keren.</p>
<p>“I’m  not  so sure. A man can put a good face on his ‘loss’ but go  on  losing sleep  over  it. Suppose Omri tells us: ‘My big dream was to be  the  greatest Rumba dancer ever. I can’t bear the thought of giving it up!’ Honestly.”</p>
<p>“Sounds highly articulate to me,” observed Hannah.</p>
<p>“Don’t you think Boaz will coach him?”</p>
<p>“But  then,  why don’t you think he’ll coach him on  the loss of earnings?”</p>
<p>“Because I don’t think Boaz knows what you have up your  sleeve!”</p>
<p>“But surely, Omri must know some dental technicians work from a wheelchair!”</p>
<p>“He may – but I don’t think he has told Boaz!” I said with confidence.</p>
<p>“He can’t  be that dumb!” countered Hannah.</p>
<p>“I  agree with Eli,” interceded Jacob Keren. “Many cases are lost  because  the client  keeps  facts from his lawyer. Such idiocy is more  damaging  than  the other party’s brilliant tactics!”</p>
<p>“Well, then, what do you suggest?”</p>
<p>“Tread  carefully on the ‘loss of enjoyment of life’ issue and go to  town  on the ‘future earnings’. Perhaps you should start with the former and leave  the cross-examination on the latter for a devastating finale.”</p>
<p>“I’d rather crush Omri at the start!” said Hannah.</p>
<p>“Well,  you are in charge. But I advocate extreme caution on the dancing issue. To my mind, Omri has been surprisingly  candid  with  our esteemed Mr. Almog. Beware of the double bluff!”</p>
<p>For a moment I glanced at my boss in amazement. Usually, Jacob Keren would have insisted that his tactics be adopted or, in the very least, would have kept arguing. It then dawned on me that his acquiescence was natural. Although the Omri Tal matter remained, nominally, a case handled by J. Keren &amp; Associates, the lead lawyer was Rotem’s new in-house counsel. In the circumstances, Keren saw no need to persevere.</p>
<p>Having concluded our discussion of the strategy, we turned to the nitty gritty details of Omri  Tal’s claim. A meticulous calculation, carried out by Jacob  Keren  with the  aid of his old fashioned adding machine, convinced us that a settlement should not exceed a total of IL19,000 or 20,000 at the most. As Boaz had  told Ruth  Schwartz,  he  would  not “even consider”  a  settlement  for  less  than IL27,000, we were reluctant to make an overture.</p>
<p>“I  suspect  the best time for a frank chat will be a day or  two  before  the trial,” observed Jacob Keren. “They’ll feel less confident by then!”</p>
