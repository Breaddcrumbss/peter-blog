When she reappeared, I stared at her with concern. Once again she had lost weight, looked worn out and a dry cough and persistent wheeze marred her speech.\n“You need a real break, Hannah. “And you ought to spend a few days in Eilat. A change of climate can do wonders.”\n“Next week I’m taking Tali to Tiberias. I’ll be away for two or three weeks.”\n“Give me a tinkle if you need anything,” I offered.\n“I shan’t need a thing. I’m going to leave the office behind!”\n“Good on you!” I approbated. “In the words of Goethe: ‘it [the office] can lick… ”.\n“Now, now, Eli,” Hannah burst into a fit laughter interrupted by a cough, “poetic licence is prohibited in all respectable law firms! And we better spend a few minutes on the Omri Tal case. I read your memo. So you think Morag will do?”\n“I’m positive.”\n“Very well then. And, Eli, I’m glad you didn’t follow up Jacob Keren’s hint. I wanted to warn you off but got too entangled in my recent case. I didn’t have the chance to talk to you.”\n“Still, don’t we have to go back to Keren?”\n“No! We won’t! I’ll take the responsibility! And, Eli, for all practical purposes you are in charge. As soon as I’m back, Jacob Keren and I have to get ready for the next phase of our major case.”\n“What if Keren raises the Omri Tal matter with me when you are away?”\n“He won’t. Malka is taking him for a holiday in Cyprus. They leave tomorrow. And if he feels up to it, she proposes to book a cruise to the Greek Islands. He, too, will be away for a few weeks.”\n“Is Keren in a bad way?” I asked. “I thought he took court cases in his stride.”\n“He isn’t getting younger! And this is a particularly tricky matter.”\n“Well, Hannah: don’t let him drag you into cases like that.”\n“Actually, Eli, I’m going to do better than that!”\n“How?”\n“I’m quitting!”\n“Quitting?\"”\n“Yes, Eli. I can’t go on like this! And it’s not just my health!”\n“What else?”\n“The other day I came home just before midnight. Tali was all worked up. She wanted to know if I had an affair with Jacob Keren!”\n“I hope you gave her a good hiding!”\n“No, Eli. That would have been counter-productive. I simply told her what Keren and I had been working on – step by step. Before long she broke into tears, hugged me and said she’d quit school and get a job so that I could have a decent rest. And she warmed up the dinner she had made for us and insisted I eat; and it was delicious!”\n“But what has all this got to do with your job here?”\n“A teenaged girl like Tali needs her mother. I’ve neglected her long enough! As things stand, I’m never at home before 8.00 p.m. It ain’t right!”\n“But do you have another job?”\n“As a matter of fact, I do. Rotem is setting up a Legal Department. It’ll take charge of lending contracts, mortgage registrations, debt collections and run of the mill litigation. Ruth Schwartz offered me the job. It’s not as glamorous as doing big cases with Keren. But the salary is O.K.; and it’s a 9.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m. desk job: just what I want. And Keren can look for some other aspiring lawyer to take my place! I’m tired of the limelight!”\n“I can see your point, Hannah. I only hope I shan’t be Keren’s next victim!”\nHannah broke into a smile. “You need not fear. Keren knows your strength is working out complex legal points. He prefers to work with somebody who is strong on facts and practicalities.”\n“That leaves me out.”\n“It does. So don’t worry!”\n“Well, how about the Omri Tal case? Keren won’t let me handle a full trial for at least another year or two. Will you be able to appear?”\n“I think so. Rotem expects me to take up court cases from time to time. So even if the case is heard after I leave, I’ll be able to take it on by arrangement.”\n","wordCount":"726","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-07-21T18:19:21+08:00","dateModified":"2025-07-21T18:19:21+08:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/legal-episodes/the-luck-of-valentino/part-6/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Peter Ellinger","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/ accesskey=h title="Peter Ellinger (Alt + H)">Peter Ellinger</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
