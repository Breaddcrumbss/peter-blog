Far from being treated either as ‘good’ or as ‘evil’, he is staged as an Adviser or Vizier, on whose advice the ‘Good Lord’ often relies (just as he did in the Book of Job).\nTheophil has powers of his own; but he exercises them sporadically. In general, he is a non-interventionist. Occasionally, though, he drops an appropriate hint in the right quarters. Moreover, from time to time he materialises in front of the eyes of a being of his choice. Usually, those he accepts in this manner become disciples and admirers.\nA complementary function, occasionally performed by Theophil, is the opening of the eyes of people searching for reason. In doing so, he tends to bear in mind that not everybody wishes to see things as they are. Often traditional men (or women) of faith are unwilling to call a spade a spade because they do not care to see it. Materialising to them would be a waste of time. Accordingly, Theophil ignores them.\nTo enhance readability the book is divided into four Parts. Part I (comprising the first five stories, which are narrated by Theophil) deals with events in which I, Peter Berger, play no overt role. In each, Theophil acts in harmony with the Good Lord.\nThe next three Parts, which comprise the remaining eleven stories, are narrated by me (Peter Berger). They reflect actual episodes from my life, reconsidered through Theophil’s lens and philosophic perspective. Part II, comprising stories 6 to 9, relates events which I recalled during my hospitalization in the XX Ward of the National University Hospital following a fainting spell. Part III, comprising stories 10 to 14, deals with events from my own life, on which I focused (with Theophil’s aid) during a period of Sabbatical Leave spent in Oxford.\nThe last Part – Part IV – comprises the remaining two stories. They deal, respectively, with my life following my wife’s demise. The first story, respecting my tour of the Indonesian islands, lampoons the hypocrisy often associated with the orthodox front displayed by pillars of faith. The last story deals with a milestone in my life, exposed by Theophil.\nOriginally, the stories in this collection were self-published under the title Ephemeral Stories, but on further reflection — and with the thoughtful assistance of an AI conversational partner — I decided to change the title to Theophil. While diverse in setting and tone, all emphasise his philosophical musings and interventions and lend coherence to the work. On this basis, I decided to treat the collection as a novel.\n","wordCount":"480","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-07-28T20:34:14+08:00","dateModified":"2025-07-28T20:34:14+08:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Peter Ellinger"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/novels/theophil/preface/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Peter Ellinger","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://peter-ellinger-blog.com/ accesskey=h title="Peter Ellinger (Alt + H)">Peter Ellinger</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
