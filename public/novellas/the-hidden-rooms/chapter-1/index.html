<p>As  the  aeroplane steadied on its westward course, I  started  to  skim through  the papers respecting the  legal  entanglement  that required my presence in London. Conscience and professional integrity dictated that   I peruse the bundle meticulously. I owed this to the friendly  law firm  that was paying handsomely for my services and for the comfortable  seat in  the  business  class  section  of  British  Airways’  direct  flight  from Singapore.</p>
<p>Usually  I should have started to work. I  have  the stamina and the alertness needed for the perusal of a bulky set  of  documents. Many a client had benefited from my perseverance. On  this  occasion, though,  I was not up to the task. To start with, I was distracted by the  hum of  the engines and by the garrulous loudspeaker. In  addition,  my  thoughts  kept straying  back to Yuan Ming. She had promised to fly to Singapore  immediately after the close of her exhibition in Los Angeles. In about four  weeks I  was going see her again. But this eagerly anticipated  moment might be delayed if my case dragged on. The thought was perturbing.</p>
<p>I was aware that my fears were largely unfounded. Bill Riggs, a former colleague of our Law Faculty in Singapore, had assured me that the case would  be over within two weeks. All the same, I kept fretting. Experience had taught me that  some of Her Majesty’s Counsel could be disturbingly long winded.  At  an honorarium  of  £800 per hour their tendency was understandable.  Unfortunately, a Professor of Law like me, flown in as an expert witness  on banking practice, was not in a position to stem the flow of their eloquence.</p>
<p>For  a  while I tried to distract myself by reverting to the  bundle  of depositions,  of  illegible  photocopies of muddled  letters  and  of  the other party’s expert  report.  Then, with a shrug of my shoulders, I gave up  the  uneven struggle. Replacing the papers in my briefcase I took out the item I had  been looking forward to examining during the flight: the catalogue of a forthcoming Christie’s auction of the contents of an elegant residence near Woodstock. The catalogue had arrived a few days before my flight. Although I had  skimmed through the colour plates of the available Continental porcelain pieces, I had not studied the handsome booklet as meticulously as, I sensed, it deserved.</p>
<p>Within a short while I became immersed in the catalogue. Although my own collection comprises mainly mid-European ceramics and prints, I have  a genuine love for all  antiques. The reason is not a wish to travel back in time. I have no illusions about  the quality  of  life  in  Europe of days past. But  the  antique  furniture,  the paintings,  the sculptures and the ceramics, which go under the hammer in  our  modern sales rooms,  are  manifestations  of  the artistic achievements  of their respective eras. They are  also  of  the  highest  quality.  After all, who would wish  to  preserve  a  poorly constructed  piece of furniture or an ill conceived porcelain figurine?</p>
<p>The  instant catalogue lent support to my sentiment. Every room  in  the stately  home was filled with fine antiques.  My  admiration was invoked by an elegant 19th  century arm chair. The desk, too, was exciting, with  beautifully  shaped legs and a delightful leather  covered  centre.  The mahogany  display cabinet, in the drawing room, made my mouth water. It  would constitute an excellent home for my Meissen figurines.</p>
<p>For a while, I remained  captivated  by  the  ambience of the rooms.  Would it not be exciting to own a  property  like this estate?  Then,  unexpectedly, an inner voice – the voice of  my  sceptic  Viennese alter  ego –  broke the spell by raising a basic question. Had  this  splendid house  been  a real home, in which a person had lived and  worked,  loved  and hated, or was it a show piece: a mere front or sparkling façade?</p>
<p>Once  again my eyes traversed the photographs of the  individual  rooms. Somehow, everything appeared too tidy, too neat, to be real. I had to  concede that,  to an extent, this effect was produced by the conscientious efforts  of Christie’s  cleaners and polishers. But the ephemeral air was not entirely  of their  making. To me, each room appeared too perfect to be genuine. The  broad  double bed with its muslin curtains was too fine to be slept in regularly. The library, which  had  only two sparsely stacked bookcases, had a number of period chairs and a sofa;  but there  were  no  library  steps. The most remarkable  room,  though,  was  the bathroom.  The huge tub in its  midst reminded me of a small Roman  spa  I had  seen  in  Trier, and the 18th  century porcelain basin  and  pitcher,  placed beside the modern hand basin, struck me as out of place in a modern house.</p>
<p>By the time the steward approached my seat with the evening meal, I  had reached  my conclusions. I had traversed  a stylish mausoleum,  occupied by  an owner who stayed there without dwelling in it. Did he regard himself  a caretaker, like the uniformed attendants who guide a group of tourists through the rooms of  palaces of kings and princes of times past.</p>
<p>As  soon  as  I  finished consuming  the plain evening  meal, I turned back to the bundle of documents related to  my forthcoming  appearance as an expert witness in London. After  a  concentrated effort on a number of pages drawn to my attention in my instructions,  I noted some  damaging  inconsistencies in the other party’s  correspondence.  Shortly thereafter  I  discovered  to my chagrin that our case  rested  on  an equally  shaky  foundation.  I  knew,  of  course,  that  the  two   financial institutions,  locked  in the instant battle, adhered to a well  known business philosophy, based on taking advantage of each available loophole and technicality in a bargain gone sour. It did not elate me to be of assistance to one of them.  I even knew that my  own policy   of  accepting  remunerative  banking  cases  without  regard  to   my principals’ mercantile morality tarnished me with the very brush I applied  to them.  These thoughts had, frequently, induced me to vow that  a  particularly unmeritorious  bundle  was the last  one to  be  handled by me. Up to now, though, my resolve had failed as soon  as  I discovered yet another exciting piece of Meissen, of Vienna or of  Frankenthal in a new catalogue. To buy it I needed extra funds. To overcome my scruples, I kept reminding myself that the Code of Ethics of our profession encouraged  me to  accept  a  brief  as  long  as  I  was  able  to  conduct  myself  without violating any legal norm.</p>
<p>This  established principle of ethics, and the covetous glances  I  kept bestowing  on  a yellow-ground milk jug produced and decorated in  Meissen  in 1735,  kept spurring me for the  next  three hours  of the flight. By the time the information chart,  displayed  on the digital screen, showed that we were approaching India, I was through  with my work. Having pinpointed the information that was going to form the basis of my supportive expert’s opinion, I congratulated myself – in sheer disregard of my  qualms – on  a job well done. Replacing the  bundle  once  again  in  my briefcase, I turned back to the catalogue. The pages setting out the  European porcelain items now had my full attention.</p>
<p>I  had discussed the yellow milk jug, that had caught my eye  during  my initial perusal of the catalogue in Singapore, with Yuan Ming. During the last few years, I rang her up regularly,  whenever she was in the Los Angeles, from her  own spacious apartment in Katong.</p>
<p>My  last call to her had taken place on the day preceding my  flight  to London.  Having   driven to the condominium after my last class  for  the day,  I  worked for a while in the study, which used to belong to  her late father, the antiques dealer and internationally acclaimed scholar Tay Fang-Shuo alias Dr Alfred Cheng, M.A., Ph.D. (Cantab.). At 10.00 p.m., when day  was ready  to break in Los Angeles, I dialled her  number.</p>
<p>“Did I wake you up?” I had asked anxiously, when she picked up the receiver.</p>
<p>“You know you haven’t; I’ve been waiting for your call for the last hour; what were you up to, Uncle?”</p>
<p>Yuan Ming – presently an attractive woman in her thirties – had  dubbed me her ‘special uncle’  when she was a little girl. It had been a mark of  her affection: there was no family tie between us. I had been her father’s  closest  friend – not his brother or brother-in-law. Out  of  habit, though,  she  kept  addressing me in the same manner even after she had grown up. She  knew  also  that  I cherished my title.</p>
<p>“Sitting at your Dad’s desk with my new Christie’s catalogue; I didn’t want to ring you before 6  o’clock in the morning!”</p>
<p>“And what did you discover in your  new catalogue?”</p>
<p>“I just looked at a few pieces; one is a lovely Meissen yellow-ground milk jug with  paintings  of a church by the river and ships loading at the quay.  I like it; and – God alone knows why –  it looks familiar. Still, they say the  handle has a hairline crack; and they estimate it at £2,000 to £3,000.  A bit high for an imperfect piece?”</p>
<p>“I  can get that crack fixed for you. If you still don’t want it, bid for  me; you can go up to £4,000. But why didn’t you look at all the pieces; you always do?”</p>
<p>“I just couldn’t concentrate!”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“I  was counting the days to your next visit. And I kept thinking of our  last afternoon  at the pool. You swim beautifully but –  even so –  I caught  you  in the end; and I’m waiting to challenge you again!”</p>
<p>I  had blurted the words out despite a desperate  attempt to control  my tongue.  Yuan  Ming   was  busy with  the  preparations  for  her  forthcoming exhibition.  I knew  that two of her pieces required  final touches  and  yet  a  third was incomplete.  My  seriously minded   alter  ego  upbraided  me  for  the pressure I was bringing  on  her.  The  truth, though,  was that I yearned to see her again.</p>
<p>To  my  relief,  I  heard her peels of laughter,  the  merry   chimes  I remembered  so well from the gone bye days when an nine years old Yuan  Ming,  sitting  on my lap in her father’s shop, was amused by my attempts to  address her  in Mandarin.</p>
<p>“You  only caught me because you cornered me when I tried to dive  under  you; and you pretended not to see I was turning!”</p>
<p>“Not  the way to talk to your old swimming instructor; you may be faster  than me  now;  but I can still outmanoeuvre you  any  time!”  I bragged, stung to the quick.</p>
<p>“So  you  say, Uncle; so you keep telling to yourself,” she teased me. &ldquo;Well, we’ll see  in  four weeks time, Mr Swimming Instructor; I’ll sure give you a run for your money!”</p>
<p>“We’ll see,” I conceded, and then,  much  more sedately and once again in control of my emotions: “But, look, are you all set for your exhibition? Everything under control?”</p>
<p>“The  two sketches are OK now; I have tarted  them up nicely. But I can’t  finish the last oil; I just can’t!” she said in a changed voice.</p>
<p>“Why not? It’s brilliant; honestly – one of your very best!”</p>
<p>“I’ll  finish it in Singapore,” she said after a long pause.</p>
<p>“But then you won’t be able to exhibit the painting this time?” I said, trying to conceal my disappointment.</p>
<p>“Never  mind;  it’ll be in my next show” she said, adding with  a  shrug:  “My admirers will have to wait for another six months!”</p>
<p>Once  again, there was a pause. I had nothing  to say. Yuan Ming had the ability and the talent. She was a fine artist. From time to time, though, she lacked the zeal. To my relief, she broke the silence before it became oppressive:</p>
<p>“And look, Uncle, you’ll see the initial sketch when we meet.”</p>
<p>“In  another  four  weeks!” I sighed, cursing myself for  the anxious cord that crept into my voice.</p>
<p>“They’ll  pass  soon,  with you rushing about in busy London.  But  look  here Uncle, what is really the matter? Why are you so agitated?”</p>
<p>“It’s the court appearance” I admitted. “Bill Riggs assures me the case will be over in two weeks; but what if it drags on?”</p>
<p>“So  that’s it” I could hear her laughter. “What an ace you are,  Uncle!  Then I’ll simply fly to  London.”</p>
<p>“But you told me you had to make a stop in Shanghai and  then settle your new deal in Hong Kong or Singapore!”</p>
<p>I  was now alluding to Yuan Ming’s second occupation. Even prior to  the onset  of  her  father’s  fatal illness,  she  had  taken the antiques business into her own hands. Unlike him, she was prepared to take risks and, from time to time, flew to China to clinch deals involving the smuggling out of rare pieces.</p>
<p>“So in the worst case we’ll meet two or three days later than expected; and so I’ll  stay  longer; and if I come to  London we could also spend  a  few days  in  Vienna.”</p>
<p>“That would be superb” I confirmed enthusiastically.</p>
<p>I  was  now overcome by elation. The prospect of a trip to my  old  home town was  exciting.  Although my family had had to flee to Palestine at the eve of the Second World War, I had always  preferred the Austrian milieu of my parents’ home in Tel Aviv  to  the harsher  Israeli  spirit that reigned outside it.  Despite  certain  childhood memories –  including the demolition of my mother’s porcelain  collection  by uniformed young men – I had visited Vienna several times after the end of  the War,  mainly to spend some time with my father who had returned to it in  1951. After a while, I started to feel at home and enjoyed myself.</p>
<p>In  recent  years,  Yuan Ming and I  had  wonderful breaks in Vienna. She had  become  alarmingly fond of the Heuriger – the newly matured wine – served in Grinzing with  light meals to the sound of music played by local bands. Waltzing with her, to their tunes,  was an exhilarating even if exhausting experience: I was, after all, her senior by  thirty years.   Occasionally,  her enthusiasm  invoked  the  spontaneous  applause of  fellow  patrons,  who  had remained seated comfortably at their tables with their glasses.</p>
<p>“That’s settled then,” she said happily. “But, honestly, is the case likely  to drag on? Bill Riggs is a pretty reliable chap, isn’t he?”</p>
<p>“I  suppose I’m getting over anxious” I confessed. “It’s just that I hate  the very thought of missing my niece even for a single day.”</p>
<p>“It  won’t happen. So don’t you worry. And, Uncle, you better take  the  catalogue with  you to steady your nerves during the flight. And I forgot to  ask,  when is your flight?”</p>
<p>“Tomorrow evening; I’ll ring you from the plane!” I promised.</p>
<p>“That will be lovely” she replied. Then, instantly, she changed her mind: “No, you  better ring me from the hotel in London: you can, of course, use my flat but I’m sure your clients have put you up in a five stars establishment.”</p>
<p>“They have” I told her. “See you soon then; and take care.”</p>
<p>“You  too,  Uncle; and don’t you forget to ring your wife as soon as  you get to the hotel. She too deserves attention.” Her  merry laughter echoed pleasantly in my ears even after she had  replaced  the receiver.</p>
<p>For  a while, and in plain defiance of new torrent of information  emanating from  the  aeroplane’s loudspeakers,  I  kept relishing the  recollection  of  this  short conversation  of  the previous day.  Then, as I stretched myself against my seat, I realised I was exhausted. Switching off the light above my head, I closed my eyes.</p>
<h3 id="2-a-leading-london-banker">2. A Leading London Banker<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-a-leading-london-banker">#</a></h3>
<p>When  I woke up, the   stewardess was  handing out steaming towels.  As I wiped my face, I saw that the catalogue, which  I  had dropped on the vacant seat next to mine, had fallen open at a page setting out the  history of the house near Woodstock and a short biography of  its  owner. Glancing  at it with curiosity, I sat up with a jerk. The owner -  Sir  Arthur Smithies  -  was a man I had known well in my days as a  research  student  in Oxford. Years later we had  met again,  by  chance,  when I was someone else’s guest  at  the  Athenaeum.   We managed to converse for a few minutes and, just before I returned to my host’s table, he showed me the catalogue of a forthcoming auction. The yellow Meissen milk  jug  was one of the pieces both of us had admired as we  leafed  quickly through the pages with the mid-European porcelain.  As I recalled this  encounter, I was momentarily irked by my failure to recognise  the jug  and,  through  it, its owner’s identity.  The  explanation,  though,  was simple. I thought that Arthur Smithies was still  living on his estate near Epping.  Indeed, I had kept sending my letters and Christmas cards to that address.</p>
<p>For the remaining two hours of the flight my thoughts focused on Sir Arthur Smithies. Our paths had crossed for the first time  shortly after I embarked on my research of the law respecting a banking facility known as  the documentary  letter of credit. Work I had carried out two years earlier on  in the course of banking litigation in Tel-Aviv had revealed that my facility was already  in use during  the first half of the 19th  century. But where and when  was this commercial technique initiated? Whose brainchild was it? To provide a conclusive answer, I needed access to bank archives. Attaching recommendations of my supervisor and of the Head of my Oxford College, I solicited information from  all  the  London banks whose history stretched  back  far  enough.  Most replies were negative. Some explained that their archives had been destroyed  during  the First or the Second World War. Others  regretted  that  old paper had been recycled.</p>
<p>All  in  all I received only two helpful letters. One,  from  a  private bank,   Brownlow   Bros.,   enclosed  a  bulky  tome  covering   the   House’s history. My attention was drawn to a passage describing  how  the partners had resolved, on 4 March 1820, to obtain Counsel’s opinion about  the legal  risks  involved in the use of documentary credits.  The  other  letter, typed  on  the elegant stationary of a merchant bank, Crawford &amp;  Co.,  did  not  provide any specific information. The writer advised me of  his  own interest in the subject  and invited me to have lunch with him in the  following  week. The signature  read: Arthur Smithies, Managing Partner.</p>
<p>In  1959, Crawford &amp; Co. had their premises in Birchin Lane off  Lombard Street.  The drab appearance of their grey building  exacerbated  my misgivings  about  my forthcoming interview with their  Managing  Partner.  My letter to them had actually been written as an afterthought. Throughout  their long history, commencing at about the middle of the 18th  century, the bulk  of Crawford  &amp;  Co.’s business had been conducted with banks  on  the  Continent, principally  in  Germany, in France  and  in the Netherlands.  My  instincts – and  such information as was available to me – had directed my hopeful glances to banks active  in  the  Anglo-American trade. I had  solicited  information  from Crawford  &amp; Co., and from other banks active in the European trade, because  no stone could be left unturned. Looking lugubriously at the front of the building in Birchin Lane, I upbraided myself for having been  too meticulous: time was precious and, alas, money was scarce.</p>
<p>My  dejected  mood  lightened  when I entered the bank.  As  soon  as  I mentioned  my  name to the aging Chief Porter, he ordered one of  his  subordinates  to  escort  me  to a waiting room.  When  we  arrived,  a  young gentleman, of about my own age, approached us and held out his hand: “I’m  Brian Davies; Mr Smithies has asked me to show you around before I  take you to his office.”</p>
<p>Leaving my wet top coat and hat in the cloak room, I followed my  guide. We  stopped  for a while in the well, where a few customers  transacted  their business  at the counters. Looking around me, I realised that Crawford &amp; Co. were a cut above the large retail banks in the City. The aura of  spaciousness conjured   by  the elegantly furbished well contrasted  pleasantly  with   the claustrophobic  atmosphere, produced in the City branches of Barclays  and  of Lloyds Bank by the urge to utilise  every square inch. The sense of rush and pressure, created by the shuffling of impatient feet  in a  queue,  was  equally absent. As I raised my head, I  admired  the  terraced mezzanine floor, with the protruding  offices, that broke the monotony of  the high wall separating the marble floor of the well from the ornate ceiling.</p>
<p>“Quite  impressive, isn’t it?” asked Brian Davies.</p>
<p>“Splendid, I should say” I answered.</p>
<p>“Wait till you see our boardroom,” he said with a smile, adding: “And there, on the north east side of the mezzanine, are the rooms of the international trade department; there – where the two fellows are peeping down at us. These  chaps do  like  to see a customer’s face before he takes the lift  to  their  little offices. Makes it easier to brave a storm.”</p>
<p>I grinned politely at the flat joke. After a short tour of the mezzanine floor  we  took  the  lift to the second floor.  The  boardroom  was,  indeed, grandiose. A plush  carpet covered the floor, the chandeliers  sparkled with  their  candle shaped bulbs and the solid, beautifully  carved,  rosewood table  surpassed any piece of furniture I had seen in Oxford. After looking at the traditional English paintings –  mainly galleons on stormy seas and hunting  scenes – I admired the delightful pink stained pinewood panelling  of the  walls.  Impulsively,  I touched it only to give a  start:  my  fingertips transmitted the cool sensation of a smooth marble surface.</p>
<p>“It does look like wood, doesn’t it,” said Brian Davies, with a satisfied grin.</p>
<p>“First time I see a terrazzo wall,” I conceded; “it’s beautiful.”</p>
<p>“It’s  also very expensive; time honoured secret process of a firm  in  Padua. They didn’t allow anyone in during the work.”  Pausing for a moment, he added with  a  thinly  veiled sneer:  “We  had  a  good year in 1957; so the  Partners  loosened  the  purse strings.”</p>
<p>I  had  by then concluded that Brian Davies was an Oxford  or  Cambridge man.  His  accent  and mannerism were unmistakable. As we  left  the  room,  I inquired about his College.</p>
<p>“King&rsquo;s,  Cambridge” he said readily. “Quite a few Oxbridge men in this  firm. Mr Smithies went to Trinity, Cambridge.”</p>
<p>Brian Davies showed me few smaller meeting rooms – all neatly even if  less lavishly  furnished  and decorated than the boardroom.  We  then proceeded  to  the broad  staircase leading to the third floor. For a few seconds I glanced  with appreciation at the neat Bokhara carpet. Then  I stopped abruptly in my tracks. I had come face  to face with a lithograph I had coveted for years.</p>
<p>“Do you like Toulouse-Lautrec?” I heard Brian Davies’ voice.</p>
<p>“Very much. He was unique,” I told him.</p>
<p>“You  may be right,” he said; “although, for myself, I prefer some  later artists  like Picasso and Matisse. We have  a few in the  Library and some others in our smaller reception rooms. Our French clients  appreciate them.” Glancing at his watch, he added: “We must proceed to Mr Smithies’  room now, but I may be able to show them to you some other time.”</p>
<p>Arthur  Smithies turned out to be a man in his mid forties.  His  auburn hair  had  started to recede but his tall, sparse, figure was not  frail.  His neat  grey suit, carefully pressed business shirt and  discreet  tie went  well with his reserved mannerism and  precise  mode  of speech. His keen brown eyes, though, projected warmth. I sensed, as soon as we shook hands, that he was a pleasant and friendly man.</p>
<p>“Glad  you could make it, Mr Berger” he said. “I’m only sorry we weren’t  able to arrange better weather for you.”</p>
<p>“Oh,  I’m getting used to it,” I told him. “And many thanks for asking  me  for lunch.” Hesitating for a moment, I added: “It was good of you to ask Mr Davies to show me around. You do have splendid rooms.”</p>
<p>“What did you think of our boardroom?”</p>
<p>“Magnificent!  But I should really congratulate you on the Lautrec lithograph. It’s the first time I have come across this piece outside a museum; and  I haven’t seen  it in any recent catalogue.”</p>
<p>“Are you a collector, then?” he asked with genuine interest.</p>
<p>“In  a  modest  way,” I said, feeling embarrassed.  Noticing  his  own resulting unease, I hurried to explain: “At  present,  I restrict myself to porcelain; mainly to  Meissen  and  Vienna figurines;  but  I like the atmosphere of auction rooms and, of  course,  good catalogues  provide  a  glimpse; some are available at half  price  after  the sale.”</p>
<p>“I  too  like Meissen,” he told me, with a smile; “but mainly  small  vases, ewers and plates: cabinet pieces. What attracts you to figurines?”</p>
<p>“Some  of them - like Kändler’s Harlequins - are really sculptures; and  great ones at that.”</p>
<p>“I  think I get your point,” he replied, thoughtfully. “You like the  figurines for  their own sake – for what they convey to you, don’t you?” Seeing me  nod, he  proceeded:  “Well, I like my pieces to blend with their  setting.  Meissen plates and ewers look nice on the shelves of a suitable cabinet.”</p>
<p>At  that  point,  our  conversation  lost  its  impetus.  My  host  was too tactful to ask for further details about the collection  of  a person  in my position.  I, in  turn,  was  too shy too persevere; I was also  apprehensive  of  appearing eager to impress.</p>
<p>To  my relief, Arthur Smithies broke the short silence. Indicating  that we  ought  to  proceed to lunch, he inquired whether I  observed  any  dietary rules. Reassured by my response, he led the way to the private room of what he called “our modest in-house restaurant.”</p>
<p>It  was  over an excellent English lunch – smoked salmon,  pumpkin  soup  and a steak and kidney pie – that Arthur Smithies turned to my enquiry.</p>
<p>“You  seem quite certain that documentary letters of credit originated in  the Anglo-American  trade.  You realise that, traditionally, our  house  has  been engaged in trade with the Continent?”</p>
<p>“I  do; but it occurred to me that some Continental merchants might have  used Crawford,  Fairbairn, Miles &amp; Co. as intermediaries for financing their  trade with America.”</p>
<p>He  had broken into an appreciative  smile when I referred to the  style used by his firm during the last quarter of the 18th  century.</p>
<p>“Quite  possible;  it will be interesting to have our  records  searched;  and there  is  another  possibility. Occasionally our house  entered  into  joint ventures  with banks active on the American scene, mainly Brownlow Bros.  You see, one of our partners married a Miss Brownlow in 1765. So we may be able to provide  some information.  But tell me please, why are you so  interested  in the  history of letters of credit?  With your background in  modern bank  litigation, I should have expected you to be concerned mainly  with  the current legal problems?”</p>
<p>He listened attentively to my explanation of the connection between  the historical  background and the relevant modern practical problems. As I proceeded, I  noticed   that Arthur Smithies  recognised some of the 18th  and early 19th century court decisions  which  I  discussed.  Was he a lawyer by  training?  For  the moment, however,  my curiosity had to be suppressed. My immediate task was  to secure my host’s assistance. To get it, I had to convince him of the  merit of my quest. Encouraged by his supportive demeanour, I went on  with my discourse. When I finished, he nodded.</p>
<p>“Quite a neat analysis, Berger. So you are studying the historical  background mainly in order to support your practical arguments?”</p>
<p>“Precisely,”  I  confirmed.  “My object is to ensure that my  points  won’t  be faulted!”</p>
<p>“The  lawyer’s  need to dot the I’s and cross the t’s. His urge to  cover  his flanks  even  before  a  broadside is fired at him; just  as  you  do  in  the preparation  of  a  complex  case for trial.”   He  had  spoken  slowly,  even guardedly;  but  his expression manifested approbation.  “Your  experience  in court must have stood you in good stead when you developed your theories.”</p>
<p>“It has, rather,” I affirmed. “But, if I may  ask, you are,  obviously, very familiar with legal work?”</p>
<p>“I  was called to the Bar before the War; for a while I practised,  mainly  in copyright and patents. But then the Bank needed my services. Sometimes I still miss the drama of the courtroom.”</p>
<p>“But surely, the City must offer its own challenges?”</p>
<p>“It does,” he conceded. “Generally, though, the atmosphere is more  relaxed than in our courts. And you don’t have to work against the clock all the time. Still, the work at the Bar was exciting.”</p>
<p>For  a  few moments he remained lost in his thoughts. I,  in  turn,  was watching him with interest.  Arthur Smithies had, I sensed, been less reserved with me than he would have been with a fellow Englishman. He was a  friendly and sincere man but, all the same, constrained by the  conventions of  his class and society. With an outsider like myself,  though,  the  strict norms could be relaxed.</p>
<p>“And  look,” I heard him say, “I do believe you have a worthwhile  project.  So does  Jack  Roberts  of  Brownlows,  from whom,  I  believe,  you  got  some information. He mentioned your enquiry when we met in the Club. I’ll see  what I can do. But it may take me a few weeks. I’ll see what  documents are left in the archives of some friendly banks.”</p>
<p>“That’s  really good of you; thanks,” I told him, “but a number of banks  wrote to tell me that their archives were no longer in existence.”</p>
<p>“Very  likely,”  he  responded; “but some of the partners and  their  families  have private  stacks  of  documents,  kept in case  somebody  wants  to  compile  a biography. I expect we’ll find some interesting documents there.”</p>
<p>We  kept  talking about other subjects for a while.  Then  Brian  Davies entered the room.  He had, obviously, been asked to join us for coffee with  a view to escorting me back through the winding corridors to the main  entrance. As I expressed my thanks, Arthur Smithies made a helpful suggestion: “I should be interested to know how your work progresses.”</p>
<p>“Would you, perhaps, be prepared to see the drafts of my chapters?” I asked  eagerly.</p>
<p>“I shall be delighted; and I may draw your attention to points respecting  our current banking practice.”</p>
<p>My  trip into the remote past – to my Oxford days – was  interrupted  by the stewardess’ request that I fasten my seat belt and put the back of my seat in  the  upright  position. Realising that I had missed  the chief  steward’s announcement, I hastened to comply.</p>
