The Platform Phenomenon An event that took place in an underground-train station in Munich’s inner city had far reaching effects on the life of three persons: Peppi Stölzl – who rose thereafter in the world, became Sir Joseph-Dieter, Freiherr von Stölzenfeld – my late father, Robert Berger, known to friends as ‘Tommy’, and myself, Peter Berger, a mendicant professor who eventually settled in Singapore but travelled from time to time to London where eventually I met Peppi,

The Locum and his Provocation After his reunion with Peppi, Dad had to travel to Italy. On his return to the old Bavarian capital, Dad took the train to Peppi’s station. Upon disembarking, he saw a strange figure mounting the podium.
“Where is Peppi Stölzl?” he asked the new incumbent.
“I’m standing in for him this morning,” came the laconic reply.
“I was hoping to see him here today.” Dad let his disappointment show.

Peppi’s Second Career Following this encounter, Peppi started to go from strength to strength. His friendship with Dad remained intact, with each rejoicing at the other’s success. Their paths, though, did not cross again.
For Dad, the turning point was Russia’s withdrawal from Vienna in 1951. He and Peppi saw in it Theophil’s hand. Modern historians have come up with a more mundane explanation: Russia’s bridgehead in Vienna was of no military, political or tactical advantage. Austria’s unilateral declaration of neutrality – the price exacted by the Russians for their withdrawal – constituted a safer barrier against Western aggression than the sparse Red Army troops stationed in the old Habsburg capital.

Anna’s Change of Heart Anna was growing up. Occasionally she brought up subjects she had never raised before. Some related to human relationships. Others touched on faith and religion. Peppi recalled, in particular, a conversation they had one evening on their way home. They had been shocked to witness a van knocking a young man off his motorcycle. Once they had recovered, they continued their walk home. Then, unexpectedly, Anna asked: “Papa, does the Good Lord really exist?”

Sale of the Munich Business Peppi decorated his new flat to his own taste. The Albigensian panel painting, which prior to Helga’s death had been kept out of sight, now adorned the wall of his study.
Shortly after moving into his new flat, Peppi received two letters. Anna wrote to say she had completed her secretarial studies and had accepted a well-paid post in one of Bremen’s leading industrial firms. She thanked him for his support in the past but emphasised that she was relieved to be able, at long last, to ‘stand on her own two feet’. Peppi’s reply, congratulating her on her achievement, was laconic.

Despite his advanced age, Peppi adjusted to his new environment in no time. Soon he felt at home both in Hampstead and in Kensington Church Street. With the joint efforts of father and daughter, Theophil’s Antiques continued to flourish. Within two years, they had taken over all the shopping space in the house. To facilitate further expansion, Peppi purchased the building.

He was delighted when one of London University’s Colleges conferred on him an Honorary Doctorate. Another source of joy was Lucy’s appointment as an Adjunct Professor in another College. Initially, Peppi was concerned about her drained appearance when she returned home after her classes. To his relief she soon adjusted to her position, carrying on her new duties without neglecting their shop.

London was blessed with a number of well-established shops specialising in European ceramics. In addition, many experienced collectors tended to acquire their pieces at auctions. Peppi, though, had learned to bide his time and could afford to be patient. The modest profit made by the end of the second year of the ceramics venture signalled that he was on the right track. A few months thereafter his enterprise gained further momentum when two adjacent porcelain shops closed down. Peppi acquired the stock-in-trade of both dealers and, as anticipated, their customers turned to his shop.

Usually, I packed my suitcase with joy for the flight to London and with a glum face for the return trip back to my barren home.
I could fill a whole ‘bundle’ with anecdotes from my visits to London. Despite his advanced age, Peppi had retained his zest for life and his keen intellect; and he was full of fun. Lucy too was an excellent companion. Occasionally, when Peppi was reluctant to go out in the evening, the two of us went to the West End on our own. After the show, we would have a snack or a drink in one of the numerous bars where, often, I listened with admiration to Lucy’s witty critique of the performance.

From time to time, when the weather permitted, I hired a car and drove us down to St Albans, Windsor or Oxford and, on many a fine spring day, to Hampton Court. Like most visitors, we continued to get lost in the maze and invariably had to wait, with the rest of the crowd, to be guided out by one of the warders.
