<meta name="description" content="1. Pension Kegel
The  electric car of Pension Kegel was waiting for me outside  the railway  station.  Fastening my scarf to keep out the crisp air of  a  typical dawn in Zermatt, I walked briskly up the platform and got in. As often before, I breathed the clean air  in deeply and with satisfaction. The absence of fuel driven motorcars was a blessing.
The electric car driver,  who was  also  the  sole concierge of the  modest  establishment,  manoeuvred  his ramshackle vehicle adroitly through the narrow and winding lanes  of  my favourite Swiss  resort. I observed with a grim smile  that  for him, too, time had not stood still: his wrinkles had deepened and his hair had turned  silver grey. Bestowing on me the smile reserved for old customers,  he carried my suitcase up the stairs  to the reception counter.">

<p>The  electric car of Pension Kegel was waiting for me outside  the railway  station.  Fastening my scarf to keep out the crisp air of  a  typical dawn in Zermatt, I walked briskly up the platform and got in. As often before, I breathed the clean air  in deeply and with satisfaction. The absence of fuel driven motorcars was a blessing.</p>
<p>The electric car driver,  who was  also  the  sole concierge of the  modest  establishment,  manoeuvred  his ramshackle vehicle adroitly through the narrow and winding lanes  of  my favourite Swiss  resort. I observed with a grim smile  that  for him, too, time had not stood still: his wrinkles had deepened and his hair had turned  silver grey. Bestowing on me the smile reserved for old customers,  he carried my suitcase up the stairs  to the reception counter.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Herr Professor. You did reserve a room overlooking  the  Zermattschein Hotel?”   the   fair receptionist let her surprise show.</p>
<p>“For  the first two days only,” I clarified. “After that I’d like to move to  a room facing the Matterhorn”.</p>
<p>“Room  4, which you like so much, will be available,” she confirmed.  “But  the room for today and tomorrow faces the street.”</p>
<p>“It’s alright; as long as I can watch the entrance to the  Zermattschein. I want to witness the arrival of an old friend!”</p>
<p>“Very well then; but it’ll be noisy: the delivery carts start to pass by from about six in the morning.”</p>
<p>“For these two days I’ll stand it,” I assured her.</p>
<h3 id="2-vigil-by-the-window">2. Vigil by the Window<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-vigil-by-the-window">#</a></h3>
<p>Up  in  the comfortable room, I shed the  clothes I had worn for the train ride from Geneva and slipped into  my  comfortable dressing gown. Leaving the window slightly ajar, so as to let in some fresh air, I assumed my  vigil. The elegant pergola of  the  Zermattschein spread right in front of me. Nobody could enter or leave the trendy hotel without passing through my line of vision. Was Pilkin, with whom I had made a rendezvous in Zermatt some forty years ago, going to come? When we last met both of us were young men in our early twenties. If he kept our appointment, would I recognise him?</p>
<p>The first electric car to arrive in front of the porch unloaded a  group of well dressed  Eastern tourists conversing in what I thought was Hokkien.  Although one of them was  a man in his sixties, with a huge bulk,  a ruddy  face  and a loud voice,  he could, obviously, not be my old  class  mate. Like myself,  Pilkin  would have lost his youthful appearance. But Occidental features remain  discernible from Oriental.</p>
<p>My  reflections were interrupted by the arrival of another  quaint  car. For  a while, the two informally dressed women, who alighted from  it,  looked with admiration at the elegant façade of the Zermattschein. Then their glances switched to the Matterhorn, displayed to its best in the bright morning air.</p>
<p>“How adorable,” chimed the smaller of them – a dark skinned, thin, girl.</p>
<p>Focusing  on her through my opera glasses I noted she was of  Anglo-Indian stock  and that she had poor taste in clothes. Her tight jeans,  loose  blouse and  the  lavish exposure of skin around her hips would have better  suited  a teenaged girl.</p>
<p>“Adorable?”  retorted  her tall, heavy set and severe looking  companion,  who appeared out of place in her tight fitting track suit. “I think  ‘magnificent’ or ‘grand’ is more like it.”</p>
<p>“That too; but it’s also adorable, cute and exciting. Don’t you see, Lilly? It looks like a big cock!”</p>
<p>“Now,  now, Joan,” chided Lilly in a protective tone laced with irony, “to  you every amorphous mass with a protrusion looks like it!”</p>
<p>The rest of their conversation was blotted out by a noisy group of tourists, who alighted from another electric car. But, even so,  the brief exchange I had overheard drove my thoughts back to the past. In his heyday, Pilkin – whose real name used to be Chayim Rosenberg – would have been glad to engage in a friendly conversation with Joan.</p>
<p>Indeed, Pilkin used to respond favourably to the many winks and tender smiles bestowed on him by  the fair  sex!  Somehow,  despite his enormous  mass,  unsightly   appearance  and uncouth  mannerism, women adored him! They dismissed his  wild  gesticulations and  his  often doddering, unsteady, gait – for which he was  nicknamed  ‘the little  elephant’ – as mild affectations. And many of the girls who  withstood my  friend’s  eccentricities  fell  for his ruddy  face,  zest  for  life  and optimistic  outlook.   Pilkin,  I  had  concluded,  titillated  the   maternal instincts of homely maids-in-waiting and was considered a good treat in bed  by glamour women. I felt confident that not-so-young Joan would have been keen to share her problems with him.</p>
<p>The  next guest of the Zermattschein arrived in one of the  picturesque, electrically driven, taxis of the secluded resort. Obviously, he had been  too impatient  to  await  the arrival in the station of one the  hotel’s own vehicles. As the driver unloaded three expensive suitcases, his passenger  viewed the hotel with overt suspicion.</p>
<p>“Are  you  sure this is the Zermattschein?” he asked in a loud,  metallic  New York accent, which contrasted sadly with the neatly cut suit and  conservative tie, worn by successful North American fund managers.</p>
<p>“Of course it is,” replied the driver urbanely.</p>
<p>“But I was told it’s the best hotel in town!”</p>
<p>“It is,” the driver assured him soothingly. “The Zermattschein is the only ‘five star plus’ hotel in Zermatt, Sir!”</p>
<p>“Don’t  you  have  a  Hilton  or  a  Conrad  here?”  asked  the  fund  manager querulously.</p>
<p>“We do not. But the Zermattschein is excellent, let me tell you.”</p>
<p>“Oh well, I suppose it’ll have to do,” answered the other and, without  tipping the  driver  who had placed the suitcases in front of the  concierge’s  porch, proceeded to the entrance.</p>
<p>Having observed him conscientiously, I concluded he was as tall and  as heavy  set as Pilkin. His voice, too, was similar and Pilkin was  a sufficiently good mimic to have acquired a New York accent and, perhaps,  even the  coarse  mannerism. The fund manager, though, boasted  a  beaked,  Jewish, nose.  Pilkin,  in contrast, was endowed with a flat snub nose. That,  and  my friend’s  light hair and blue eyes, had provided a rich source of jokes  about the sharp contrast between his Slavic features and his traditional Jewish Zionist  outlook.</p>
<p>Pilkin’s   deep resentment of  such  remarks  surfaced  one morning, during our third year in secondary school, when we studied a medieval text  about the conversion to Judaism of the Kingdom of the Kesars. After  the class,  one  of our self-appointed jesters observed gleefully that,  far  from being  a  descendant of King David, Pilkin’s lineage could be  traced  to  the Caucasus . It took the joint efforts of two of our strongest classmates and of my  soothing  words  to keep the enraged Pilkin from hauling  himself  on  the offender,  whose  mouth  had fallen wide open  at  my  friend’s extreme reaction!</p>
<p>The guests who emerged in front of the Zermattschein  from the next  few cars  were  of no interest to me. They comprised young  holidaymakers,  middle aged  Australians and New Zealanders  and, to my surprise, one family  from  a Gulf  country.</p>
<p>My reflections of the past were, however, rekindled by a  group of stylish Japanese tourists, whose  suave mannerism and elegant deportment contrasted with the mass produced movie cameras they carried. Their unaccustomed bearings made me recall Pilkin’s excitement when  the two  of us went  to see  Rashomon [a famous Japanese film], accompanied by attractive though heavy set  Shosh Levi, with her lush black hair, sparkling black eyes and mellow yet not seductive voice. Pilkin, who was even then dreaming of a career on the  stage, was  fascinated  by the alien projection of a single story as seen by  three  different  characters. He conceded that the embryonic idea could be traced to  Euripides’ late  plays. He insisted, nevertheless, that the brilliant photography of  the radical Japanese production and the surrealist effect of the ephemeral  stage, had opened the door to a new era in the theatre. Shosh and I, the conservative sticklers to the Gutenberg culture, smiled tolerantly.</p>
<h3 id="3-a-glimpse-of-rabbi-zohar">3. A Glimpse of Rabbi Zohar<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-a-glimpse-of-rabbi-zohar">#</a></h3>
<p>A  glance  at my watch revealed it was getting close to noon.  I  sensed that,  for the time being, I might as well give up my vigil. To  economise  on time,  Pilkin  had  made a habit of arriving at his  destination  either  well before  noon or late in the evening. Unless he had arrived in  Zermatt  before me, he was unlikely to turn up till the end of the day or early next morning.</p>
<p>I was placing my opera glasses in their case, when my eye was caught  by an  apparition.  A Hassid, in 18th century  East  European  clothes, emerged  from  the fashionable hotel across the narrow lane.  His  black  silk caftan,  broad  old fashioned  matching hat and his long even  if  tidy  white beard,  complemented by  curly side burns, reminded me of the  ultra  orthodox Neturei Karta sect. During my years in Jerusalem, that sect had been a source  of derisive remarks made not only by an assimilated Viennese Jew  like myself  but  even  by the far more traditional and  quite  observant  Chayim Rosenberg  alias Pilkin. “When religion turns fanatic it becomes  uncivilised,” he  used  to  say, bestowing on any Hassid and  Boibricks [extremely orthodox] we encountered dark glances exuding revulsion.</p>
<p>With  just as strong an antipathy, I watched how the anachronistically clad  Hassid proceeded slowly to the gate of the Zermattschein, his immense frame supported by a smart  walking stick.  He was about to turn into the lane, when a young porter  came  rushing after him.</p>
<p>“Rabbi  Zohar,”  he said respectfully, “we just got  some really nice Salmon trout. The Chef asks: would you like one  for dinner  and do you want it steamed or can he use a new recipe he just got from Paris?”</p>
<p>“Please  tell the Chef,” replied the Rabbi warmly, in a  New  York accent as pronounced as the American fund manager’s, “that  I trust  his masterly skills. He  is  a real virtuoso. I look forward to the treat he is preparing for me! You do pamper me up here!”</p>
<p>“It is a pleasure, Rabbi Zohar. We are honoured  to have you here.”</p>
<p>“The  pleasure is all mine,” replied the Rabbi benignly and, resuming his  slow but  steady  stroll,  walked through the gate. His  grin  and  eager expression reminded me of Pilkin. A similar smile of anticipation used to descend on  his boyish  face when we made our way to a  Pita Falafel  stall in  Disengoff Street  or to one of our favourite eateries.</p>
<p>Gluttony,  I reflected, occupied a special place amongst human vices.  If  you succumbed to one of the other seven mortal sins, such as pride or avarice, you could  readily  become a target of hatred or  contempt. In  contrast,  the over indulgence of the dandified gourmand was met with raised  eyebrows or, at worst, with patronising sniggers.</p>
<h3 id="4-a-trip-to-furi">4. A Trip to Furi<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4-a-trip-to-furi">#</a></h3>
<p>“Any luck?” asked the receptionist when I placed the key on her desk on my way out.</p>
<p>“None”  I told her, “my friend must have arrived before me or,  perhaps,  will come tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure he’ll stay in the Zermattschein?”</p>
<p>“If he can afford it: he likes his comforts. But look, can you please find out later in the day if he has booked a table for tomorrow’s dinner?”</p>
<p>“Under what name?”</p>
<p>“Mine!”</p>
<p>“Yours??”</p>
<p>“Yes,  that was the arrangement: made some forty years ago! He was to book the table in my name for  7.00 p.m. at the Zermattschein!”</p>
<p>“I’ll give them a ring later,” she said, trying hard to hide her amusement.</p>
<p>A number of chair lifts  transported eager visitors  to skiing resorts and hiking walks  high above Zermatt. The furthest up the slope was known as Kleinmatterhorn. I had never ventured to go as high: the air was too thin so that any person suffering from blood circulation problems was at risk. Nowadays, with serious blood pressure problems, most spots were out of my reach. Still, the altitude of first spot,  Furi,  was just about 1870 metres above sea level. My GP assured me that the risk involved in such an ascent was negligible.</p>
<p>I had visited Furi often, both during the trip with Pilkin and in later years. It could be reached by a lengthy walk up-hill or by a 15 minutes ride in a chair lift.  When I alighted,  my heavy breathing firmed my resolve not to go to higher up.  When, after a few minutes,  my slight giddiness was over, I got up from my bench and took  one  of  the tracks I had come to know over the years. After a while, I spotted the American fund manager and thought it best to proceed in a different direction. As  I passed a bend, I saw Joan and Lilly, who were once again chatting  away.</p>
<p>Hoping  to  eavesdrop on some juicy bits, I stole in their direction  only  to discover  they were discussing  mundane clauses in standard  foreign  exchange contracts of the type used in our own legal practice in Singapore.</p>
<p>“But,  Lilly,” protested Joan, “this silly clause makes no sense at  all;  it’s rubbish!”</p>
<p>“I  know,” sighed Lilly patiently, “but the clients like it; and it can  do  no harm. So why not simply leave it in? Be smart, Joan – don’t rock the boat!”</p>
<p>Joan gave in reluctantly: “Oh very well.”</p>
<p>So Joan and Lilly were London lawyers, taking a break in Zermatt. Yet they were finding it impossible to leave their office behind! Chuckling,  I turned on my heels and nearly ran  into  the arms  of  the Hassid, Rabbi Zohar. Both of us muttered apologies,  followed  by  a brief exchange on the splendours of the discreet mountain resort. The  twinkle in Rabbi Zohar’s blue eyes did much to abate  my antagonistic feelings. For a fanatic, he seemed strangely good humoured and relaxed.</p>
<p>After  a lavish lunch in a new bistro, I walked slowly downhill back  to Pension Kegel. A brief note, in the receptionist’s unformed handwriting,  advised that no table in my name had been booked in the Zermattschein. Trying hard  to hide  my disappointment, I climbed up the stairs to my room. Has  Pilkin reneged on our arrangement? Next evening I was bound to find out!</p>

<p>The  thought that Pilkin might have had a change of heart disrupted my  afternoon siesta. For a number of years I had not heard from him. Then, just a few months  ago, he sent me a Jewish New Year card. A scrawl  at its foot read: “see you in Zermatt as planned”. It confirmed that Pilkin had not forgotten. But could some unforeseen event have induced him to  back out?</p>
<p>Affectionately,  I  recalled the early days in our Secondary  School  in Masor Street in Central Tel Aviv, called ‘Tichon Ironi A’ (literally meaning “High School 1” and fondly nicknamed “TA.1”). The fetish of our fundamentally liberal, even if somewhat traditional, institution was scholastic achievement. Pupils were subjected to four years of rigorous studies. In their first two years, they had to cover basic courses in the arts and in the sciences.  In their third  year, pupils had to choose between the Humanist Stream and the Scientific Stream. The emphasis in the former was on History, Literature and Biblical Studies. Classics, alas, were not taught. The main subjects in the latter stream were Advanced Mathematics, Theoretical Physics and Organic Chemistry. All pupils were, however, required to study the art of writing and composition. Further, in addition to the subjects in the stream chosen, each of us  had to take at least  one subject from the other stream.</p>
<p>In line with its emphasis on excellence,  TA.1 admitted only the best leavers of primary schools from all suburbs in Tel Aviv. Background, status and family connections were not given weight in the selection process. What mattered was the applicant’s studying technique and his potential for success in a professional or academic career.</p>
<p>I  had come  from  a boys’ school in prosperous middle class Melchett  Street  whilst Chayim (Pilkin)  was one of the few to be admitted from a school in the south  of  Tel Aviv,  in  the vicinity of ramshackle Schechunat Ha’Tikva.</p>
<p>This,  in  itself, would not have created a gulf between us. In those pioneering days  Israel  was  egalitarian.  The problem lay more  in  a  cultural  demarcator. Chayim’s  grandparents  had migrated to Palestine from Eastern Europe.  They  and their offspring were conversant in Polish, Yiddish and Hebrew. They were reasonably observant without, at the same time, being truly orthodox (“Froom” in the slang of those days). Chayim’s mother, for instance, lit candles on Friday evening. But she had no compunction about switching on electricity on Saturday – the Sabbath.</p>
<p>All in all,  Chayim’s religious orientation was moderate. He did not grow sideburns and did not wear a Talith. Still, unlike most of our schoolmates, he covered his head with a scalp cap – a Yarmolka – in our biblical studies lessons, generally observed the dietary laws known as Kashruth and occasionally went to prayers on the eve of the Sabbath. I recalled vividly how, on one occasion, I saw him in Allenby street on the last day of the Feast of Tabernacle. He was walking back from his Synagogue in the company of his young brother, who was proudly carrying the customary cardboard flag, with its rich display of biblical themes and with the remnants of a colourful candle attached to its post.</p>
<p>My parents  home had a different flavour.  As a middle aged couple, they had to escape from Vienna on the eve of Austria’s annexation by Germany – the  Anschluß. Still, my parents’  language, values and orientation remained those of Austria of the first decades of the  20th century.  Ethnically,  of  course, they were Jewish but,  like all  their assimilated compatriots,  they had shed all cultural ties with their origin. Traditional Jewish homes like Chayim’s were just as alien to them as Yiddish and Polish.</p>
<p>My  own  outlook was  similar to theirs: jibes about  religion came to me naturally! In the circumstances, during our first year in TA.1, communications between Chayim and myself remained confined to occasional polite nods and the usual exchanges in classes. Even in the regular picnics – ‘Kumsitzes’ in the slang of  our era – the two of us did not mix. He was the heart and soul  of every gathering and  party. I was a shy boy, glad to  stick  to the  fringes.</p>
<p>All the same, I did from  time  to time  step over to congratulate Chayim when he entertained us with one  of his sparkling performances, usually a comic scene from a popular drama or  the recital of a modern Hebrew poem. It was at the end of  one such  performance, when Chayim was swaying drunk with success, that on my subtle  promptings  he was nicknamed ‘Pilkin’ (the little elephant). A few weeks later he  took  his revenge and had me dubbed ‘Bushi’ (a befitting tag for a shy lad). Needless to say, both names stuck!</p>
<p>None of this was conducive to the creation of meaningful links. Fortunately, the two of us had more fruitful communications in class. As both of us disliked science, we had enrolled in the humanist stream. Yet we were not in competition . My interests were mainly in  history and  in  philosophy.  Pilkin loved literature and excelled in  Arabic  and  in Talmudic studies. Frequently, we  stepped to one another’s aid  when a  teacher gave us a hard time.</p>
<p>When the prodding  came  from  the English Language Master, both of us were usually saved by pretty Shosh, who  was engrossed  in  Shelley, Keats and Browning. It was only natural that these occasional acts of help forged a bond between the three of us. Yet  another drive  to  friendship  was exercised  by gluttony that bound both Pilkin and me to Shosh. When  our scientifically orientated classmates amused themselves by solving problems  of calculus or by memorising chemical formulas, the three of us stole away to a nearby Pita Falafel or ice cream store for pleasures accessible to common people.</p>
