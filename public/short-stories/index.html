Conscience prompted me to concentrate on the examination scripts I had to mark. But as was to be expected, every candidate sought to demonstrate his knowledge of the entire subject and failed to deal with the hidden issues. Worse still, many examinees recapitulated some of the jokes I had cracked in my lectures. Was I as poor a raconteur as my students?

She was one of those buxom self-assured women, who prefer to be called girls and who want you to believe they were going to remain eternally youngish. She had rattled their “specials” down as soon as I was seated and, coaxingly, mentioned that the snapper and the rainbow trout were real fresh. Although I was the first customer she was now standing there restlessly, overtly resenting that, instead of ordering one of these dishes, I had proceeded with a conscientious perusal of the menu. “A slow operator” – was written all over her face and the assessment, I suspected, was not confined to my standing as a patron of the establishment.

An episode in the life of our School’s Principal, Dr. Joseph Katz – nicknamed Sheen on account of his shining pie bald head – drives the point home. During Sheen’s long life, I feared that making the story public might add insult to the injury we – his callous pupils – inflicted on him in his heyday. Recently, though, I received the obituary written about the late Dr Katz by my old bosom pal, “Pilkin” – originally answering to Chayim Rosenberg but currently known as Rabbi Loeb Zohar. When I finished reading the moving composition, it dawned on me that the story need no longer be regarded as privileged. I abandon my discretion willingly! Freedom of speech – as we all know – is the paramount privilege conferred on ordinary humans – including a mendicant professor - in our enlightened era.

It took place at the beginning of the 20th century, when the Habsburg Empire was still intact. I met Peppi years later – after the end of World War II. By then, Peppi had risen in the world, had settled in London and became Sir Joseph-Dieter von Stölzenfeld.

A short trip from our hotel in Zurich took us to the town’s airport-terminal. When the attendant put my luggage on the scale, I wanted to get out my wallet with my credit cards so as to pay a surcharge. To my dismay it was gone: I had been pickpocketed.

It figures when the Scroll of Esther is read out.

To me, each has a special meaning. They were given to me as I climbed up my professional and personal ladder.
The first elephant, made of sterling silver, is a fine replica. The original, which I lost years ago during one of my many moves, was given to me as a Bar-Mitzvah gift. For those unfamiliar with Jewish folklore, it is relevant to mention that when a Jewish boy turns thirteen, he ceases to be a child and must observe all rituals. One of his duties is to be called up to the Torah-reading-podium where he has to recite the Haftara – a passage of the bible earmarked for the occasion.

The earliest figurine was produced in the factory of Claudius du Pacquier, which was founded in Vienna in 1718. It is a Turk, modeled and fired around 1730.
He sits crossed legged on a cushion. His right hand commands a troop or band. The Turk’s powerful, perhaps even threatening, expression belies his minute size. Porcelain experts took the view that this Turk might have been intended to serve as a tureen’s finial; but I have my doubts. He has his own vocation. He is a leader and not altogether benign. His object is to implement the Sultan’s policy. Nobody would use this Turk as the mere finial of a larger object.
